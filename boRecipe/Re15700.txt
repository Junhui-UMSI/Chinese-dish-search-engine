  "Instructions": "ALLSPICE: These small dark, reddish-brown berries are so called because  their aroma and flavor resemble a combination of cinnamon, cloves and  nutmeg. Use berries whole in marinades; for boiling and pot roasting meats  and poultry; in fish dishes, pickles and chutneys. Also available ground  and excellent for flavoring soups, sauces and desserts.    ANISE: Commonly called asniseed, these small, brown oval seeds have the  sweet, pungent flavor of licorice. Also available ground. Use seeds in  stews and vegetable dishes, or sprinkle over loaves and rolls before  baking. Try ground anise for flavoring fish dishes and pastries for fruit  pies.    CARAWAY: Small brown, crescent-shaped seeds with a strong liquorice flavor  and especially delicious as a flavoring in braised cabbage and sauerkraut  recipes, breads (particularly rye), cakes and cheeses.    CARDAMOM: Small, triangular-shaped pods containing numerous small black  seeds which have a warm, highly aeromatic flavor. You can buy green or  black cardamoms although the smaller green type is more widely available.    CAYENNE: Orangey-red in color, this ground pepper is extremely hot and  pungent. Not to be confused with paprika which, although related, is mild  flavored.    CHILI POWDER: Made from dried red chilies. This red powder varies in flavor  and hotness, from mild to hot. A less fiery type is found in chili  seasoning.    CINNAMON & CASSIA: Shavings of bark from the cinnamon tree are processed  and curled to form cinnamon sticks. Also available in ground form. Spicy,  fragrant and sweet, it is used widely in savory and sweet dishes. Cassia  (from the dried bark of the cassia tree) is similar to cinnamon, but less  delicate in flavor with a slight pungent bite.    CLOVES: These dried, unopened flower buds give a warm aroma and pungency to  foods, but should be used with care as the flavor can become overpowering.  Available in ground form. Cloves are added to soups, sauces, mulled drinks,  stewed fruits and apple pies.    CORIANDER: Available in seed and ground form. These tiny, pale brown seeds  have a mild, spicy flavor with a slight orange peel fragrance. An essential  spice in curry dishes, but also extremely good in many cake and cookie  recipes.    CUMIN: Sold in seed or ground. Cumin has a warm, pungent aromatic flavor  and is used extensively in flavor curries and many Middle Eastern and  Mexican dishes. Popular in Germany for flavoring sauerkraut and pork  dishes. Use ground or whole in meat dishes and stuffed vegetables.    All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark place,  as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.    ",
