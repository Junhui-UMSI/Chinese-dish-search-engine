  "Instructions": "cut into 2- by 3-inch pieces (reserve 4 cups of the soaking liquid) Flour  for dredging 1/2 cup pure Spanish olive oil FOR THE SOFRITO: 1/4 cup pure  Spanish olive oil 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped 6  cloves garlic, finely chopped 2 large onions, finely chopped 1 cup finely  chopped drained pimientos 2 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes 1 tablespoon  Spanish paprika or mild paprika 1/4 cup dry white wine Salt and freshly  ground black pepper to taste TO COMPLETE THE DISH: 4 medium-size  all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices 3 pimientos, cut  into strips, for garnish Fried Bread Rounds (recipe follows), as an  accompaniment Notes: One day in advance of serving, rinse the salt cod  under cold running water. Cut it into 2- by 3-inch pieces, place in a bowl,  and cover with cold water. Change the water several times until it is no  longer salty. This process should take 24 hours. Drain the fish, place it  in a small saucepan, cover with fresh water, and bring to boil over  medium-high heat. Lower the heat to low and simmer 5 minutes. Drain and  cool the fish. 1. Dredge the cod in the flour. In a large skillet over  medium heat, heat the oil until fragrant, then cook the fish until lightly  browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove the fish from the heat and set  aside. 2. For the sofrito, in a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the  oil until fragrant, then cook the bell peppers, stirring, until slightly  softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the garlic and  onions, and cook, stirring, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes, adding more oil  if necessary. Add the pimientos, tomatoes, paprika, and wine and cook,  stirring occasionally, until thickened, another 10 to 12 minutes. 3. Place  the reserved salt cod soaking water in a medium-size saucepan over  medium-high heat and cook the potato slices until partially tender, 10 to  15 minutes. 4. Add the codfish chunks to the sofrito and cook over low heat  10 minutes. Arrange the cooked potato slices on top of the fish, do not  stir, cover the pan, and shake it several times. Cook over low heat an  additional 10 minutes so that the potatoes absorb the fish flavor. Transfer  to a large serving platter and garnish with the pimientos. Serve with Pan  Frito (Fried Bread Rounds) and Arroz Blanco (see CUBA07.TXT). Makes 8  servings BACALAO A LA VISZCAINA    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip",
