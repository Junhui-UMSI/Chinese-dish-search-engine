  "Instructions": "Ive decided to share++at long last++the only two recipes I can call  my own.  Both these were developed before I really knew how to cook,  in times of poverty (which seems to come and go with alarming  regularity). Theyre good and cheap, an unbeatable combination.  Heres number one... Copious quantities of ice cold beer is the best  accompaniment for this. This dish is a truly international one and  bears little resemblance to anything from either Sweden (Im part  Swedish++hence the name) or Mexico. The inspiration is Mexican, the  utensils and some of the techniques used are Chinese, the ingredients  are all-American (with the exception of the tortillas). Its \"peasant  food\" in the best tradition++ cheap, full of flavor, healthy and  satisfying.  I cooked these so often that I got to where I could  knock out a complete, filling dinner++even with the frozen  hamburger++in less than half an hour.  Follow the recipe closely++ at  least the first time to see what its spposed to taste like. Ive  never had anyone dislike this recipe, with the possible exception of  a vegetarian or two. Slice and dice first.  Put everything into  separate serving dishes as you cut em. Smash the garlic cloves,  remove the skins and mince coarsely. Chop the onions into pieces  about a quarter to half an inch square. Dice or slice the hot  chilies.  Grate the cheddar on the side of the grater with the big  round holes.  Cut the tomatoes into chunks about the same size as the  onions or a little larger.  Shred the lettuce finely++ into strips  maybe 1/8 inch wide. The essence of this dish is textured savoriness.  The sharp cheddar, hot chilies, and yellow onions all contribute  without overpowering one another. The tomatoes, besides adding a nice  acidy zing, also give moisture. But the key to the savoriness and to  the unique taste of the dish lies in the first two steps involving  the garlic, onions and hamburger. Cheap hamburger is used because it  has a high fat content and lots of taste. Ive made this with chopped  sirloin and the like and believe me, the result is definitely  inferior to using the cheap stuff. Now that youve got everything  sliced, diced and chopped you can start cooking. Actually, I usually  do these first couple of steps prior to doing most of the cutting.  That speeds things up a bit. Heat a wok over high heat and put in a  nice dollop of peanut oil++ about 2 tablespoons or so.  Let it heat  for a minute then toss in the minced garlic, followed a second or two  later by about 2/3rds of the chopped yellow onion++the rest goes on  the table, raw.  Right about now, its gonna start smelling good in  the ol kitchen.  Stir the onions and garlic and reduce the heat to  medium.  Take the frozen hamburger out of its wrapping and put it in  the wok as is.  Smoosh it down and push the onions and garlic out of  the way so the surface of the frozen hamburger is in contact with the  hot surface of the wok.  If you havent already whacked up everything  else, nows the time to get on that. As the hamburger browns, scrape  off the done surface with a slotted spoon or spatula of some sort.  This goes on during the whole cooking time. Flip the block of meat  over and scrape off the browned bits.  Let the other side brown a bit  then repeat the process.  The idea is to brown both the onions and  the garlic well. Big no-nos, I know, but I was young and ignorant  and what did I know. As it turns out it was a happy mistake. The  browned onions and garlic give an nice sharp, distinctive savoriness  to the finished dish. I salt the meat periodically while its  cooking. The reason for using frozen hamburger is that when its all  finally cooked, youll have bits of meat ranging all the way from  well done and crunchy to nearly raw. This gives a very interesting  texture and deepens the range of tastes. You may need to lower the  heat under the wok toward the end to avoid over cooking the meat. And  the bits will all be steeped in the wonderful juices from the cooking  onions and garlic.  Sometimes I drain the meat at the end of cooking,  sometimes I dont.  It depends on how fatty the meat is. These should  have taste, but not be grease- burgers. You should be through  chopping the rest of the stuff about the time the meat gets done.  Nows the time to tackle the tortillas.  I prefer soft tortillas over  the deep fried, crunchy shells. I use an old, cast iron griddle that  fits over two burners. I heat the griddle over a medium fire, then  pour a bit of olive oil onto it. This doesnt add any taste, but the  aroma while the tortillas are cooking is heavenly!  I warm two  tortillas at a time, flip them over and let them cook a bit more.  As  theyre done, I put them on a plate covered with pot lid to keep them  warm. Soon as the tortillas are done, put everything on the table in  the individual bowls and dig in. Everyone assembles their own tacos  according to their tastes. My method is to put on a layer of  meat++not too thick, then a layer of the chopped hot chilies, a layer  of cheddar, a layer of chopped raw onions, then tomatoes and finally  a layer of iceberg lettuce.  Just before folding I anoint the whole  mess liberally with Tabasco sauce.  Ive also used Jamaican  Pickapeppa sauce and its quite good on these too.  Season with salt  during assembly if you like. The finished dish is an incredible  medley of tastes and textures, each distinct and flavorful, with at  least two distinct kinds of hotness. Great food that you eat with  your fingers. What could be better?    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; August 25 1992.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip",
