  "Instructions": "The following passage is from \"Chinese Gastronomy\", one of the best  books on Chinese cuisine Ive ever seen.  It beautifully expresses  the nearly metaphysical regard that the Chinese have for food and  eating and is delightful reading even if you never cook a single  recipe from it. This dish is incredibly good, considering that its  main ingredients are pork fat and skin.  The fat is not something to  be gotten rid of in this case. Its treasured for what it is.  Like I  said, this is something that I dont cook often but its a special  occasion when I do.    This is one of my all time favorites.  I serve it with a bowl of  Chinese mustard and a bowl of chopped green onions for dipping.    At one time the butcher shops of Soochow were variously called Genuine  Straw Mat, Original Straw Mat, Old Straw Mat, etc., just because  there is a story about an Immortal in disguise who flung a bit of mat  into a pot of belly pork to give it a special fragrance.  The  fragrance is easy enough to produce.  What is important is that it  stands out in a clear field. Instead of being heavy, the pork should  appear light; clean instead of messy; smooth instead of lumpy.  The  flavour of pork is effusive. While the cooking of chicken and beef  means the careful carving out of its best flavour from the raw  material, the flavours of pork must be restrained. At its best, pork  is tender, sweet, fragrant, tasty, rich without being oily (in other  words, nun, hsien, hsiang, nung, yu-er-pu-ni).    A geometrically precise square of belly pork is stewed and then  steamed in a little sauce, so that it is served with an absolutely  clear layer of melted fat overlying a smooth brown sauce.  The  surface is a rich brown colour, the fat smooth and custard-like, the  meat brown and tender. The square of fat was named after Su Tungpo,  the poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would  have like it.  The square of fat is regarded with much passion,  tenderness and expectation.    Second-rate versions of it appear everywhere, differing from the  following version by their failure to clear the field for the  delicacy of the pork fat which, if prepared accordingly, tastes fresh  and clean like fresh (sweet) butter.  In order to keep the flavour  clear, the meat is first salted to remove the bloody juices, blanched  to remove the scum, then stewed very slowly, and finally steamed for  hours to tenderize the fat slowly.  Inferior versions this are made  by stewing pork for a few hours without steaming it...  The result is  lumpy fat.  If the salt rub and blanching are omitted the juice  becomes messy and lumpy.  The simplicity of appearance, smoothness  and clarity of flavour have to be wrested from the manifold flavours  of pork.    Tungpo Pork is customarily served at the end of a meal with bowls of  rice. People sigh, shout and groan with happiness when they see it.    This is one of the pinnacles of gastronomy, and sums up the  application of fat in Chinese cuisine.    Trim pork into a precise square.  Wash it and wipe it dry with a  towel. Rub it with salt and let it stand for about 2 hours.  Discard  the blood-tinged liquid.    Bring 5 pints (12 cups) water to a boil and blanch the meat in it.  Rinse it free of scum and repeat the blanching with a fresh portion  of boiling water.  Place the pork skin side up in a pot with a  tight-fitting lid, adding soy sauce, wine, spring onions ginger and 2  tablespoons water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very  low and simmer for 2 hours, adding a little more water if necessary.  Keep the amount of liquid as small as possible, and do not keep  uncovering the pot to see how the pork is progressing.  Let it stew  in its own juices.    Discard the spring onions and ginger.  Place the square skin side  down on a dish of soup plate dimensions, add the juices and cover it  very closely with foil, cellophane or an overlapping plate.  Steam it  for 4 hours, until the fat is tender and can be cut with a spoon.  Invert the square so that the fat is uppermost, and pour the juices  around it carefully.
