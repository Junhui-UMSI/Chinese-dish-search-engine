  "Instructions": "LIVER PASTE 2: (Leverpostej 2)    Put 2 lb. pigs liver twice through the grinder.  Then put 1 lb. fat  pork twice through the grinder together with an onion but do not mix  the liver with the pork.  Mix 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour and 2  cups of milk in a pot and let simmer.  Add the ground pork and stir  until the pork fat has melted.  Take the pot off, add the liver and  two whole eggs, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.    Put in a fireproof dish, place this in a water, and bake in a slow  oven for 1 1/2 hours.    COLD ROAST PORK:  (Flaerskesteg)    Spread thin slices of roast pork on buttered bread and decorate with  crisp pieces of rind, slices of jellied consomme (like consomme but  with enough gelatin added to make it hold shape) cucumber salad or  slices of pickled gherkin and red beets or red cabbage.    BOILED BREAST OF BEEF:  (Kogt Oksebryst)    Spread the bread with butter and put on slices of boiled breast of  beef. Decorate with a small pile of chopped pickles at one end and a  pile of shredded horseradish at the other.  For a center decoration  use a slice of tomato, cut halfway through and twisted so it will  stand upright.    SMOKED SALAMI AND BOILED POTATO:  (Spegepolse med kogte Kartofler)    Put slices of salami on bread spread with either butter or spiced  pork fat.    Arrange a row of slices of cold boiled potato along the center of the  salami, and on top of them run a strip of finely cut, fresh chives.    THE HANS ANDERSEN SANDWICH:  (H.  C.  Andersen Sandwich)    Butter a piece of either dark or light rye bread and put two rows of  crisp bacon on top.  Place slice liver paste across one of the rows  and tomato slice across the other.  In winter the latter may be  substituted by tomato ketchup.  Top the tomato slices with scraped  horseradish and a strip of jellied consomme.    \"THE VETERINARIANS MIDNIGHT SNACK\":  (Dyrlaegens Natmad)    Spread spiced lard on a piece of dark rye bread, and put slices of  liver paste on top.  Pieces of jellied consomme are placed over this,  and on top pieces of slightly salted boiled veal.  Decorate with  cress.    BLUE CHEESE AND EGG YOLK:  (Roquefort Ost med Aeggeblomme)    Butter a piece of white bread and spread Danish blue cheese (or  gorgonzola) in a ring, making a hollow in the center. When eating the  sandwich, break the yolk and spread it across the cheese.    Thin slices of radish may be used to decorate this and other kinds of  cheese sandwiches.
