  "Instructions": "* backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head    To further explore the international links of various cuisines, check  out this one and remember a few months back when we were talking abou  the Pacific Island custom of cooking in pits.  I didnt realize that  the Mexicans also had such a practice.  Heres a series of recipes  revolving around Mexican Barbacoa or BBQ.    To be very authentic, use a lamb which has been slaughtered the day  before the cookout and hung overnight.  On the day of the big event,  the animal is split into sections:  backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs,  and head.    METHOD:    We assume that no one would tackle this kind of barbecue without a  large number of guests-the kind who really like to pitch in.  So, the  first thing to do is to set one group of your guests to digging a  hole about four feet by two feet across.  Other members of the party  can scout up kindling and others can be set to work cleaning each  maguey leaf.    Once the hole is dug, it is plastered with mud to keep the walls firm.  Large porous stones should then be placed in the bottom of the pit  (beware of little hard rocks; theyll split open).  Over the stones  put enough dry wood to fill the pit, then set fire to the wood and  let it burn to the smokeless coal stage.  While the fire is burning  down, the maguey leaves should be toasted until limp, for this will  enable them to release precious juices needed to season the meat.    When the fire has burned down sufficiently, line the pit with the  maguey leaves, making sure that all of the mud is covered so meat  will not stick to pit.  The leaves should be suspended vertically,  the tips overlapping all the way around and held down with stones for  the moment.    The next step is to lower a grate into the hole and on it place the  casserole with soup ingredients.  On top of the uncovered casserole  ingredients, arrange the lamb pieces, starting with the backbone,  then the legs, shoulders, rib sections, and the head.  Do not salt  meat before it is cooked, for this can toughen it.    After meat is in the pit, fold the tips of the maguey leaves into the  hole to cover the meat well.  Over this place a metal sheet to keep  any earth from seeping into the pit and then seal the pit with a coat  of fresh mud and build a large fire over the metal sheet and mud  cover.    Keep the fire blazing for 5 or 6 hours, depending upon the age of the  meat. Open the pit, salt the meat before serving it, and accompany it  with Salsa Borracha*.   The broth is served in small cups.    *  See Shepherds Roast with Drunken Sauce for recipe.    From \"The Art of Mexican Cooking\" by Jan Aaron and Sachs Salom.  Doubleday and Company, N.Y., 1965.
