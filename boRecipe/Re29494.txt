  "Instructions": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Prepare the hens by rinsing thoroughly,  checking for pin feathers and patting dry. Be sure to remove yellow fat  found at the cavity opening.    Gently separate the skin from the flesh by sliding your fingers between and  tearing the connecting membrane. It is easiest to begin at the cavity  opening and work up the breast. Leave skin attached at the lower two-thirds  of the wings and base of the legs. Work carefully over the breastbone area  so as not to tear the skin which is firmly attached at this point.    Thoroughly blend the butter, lemon juice, tarragon and salt. If the butter  is not soft, it will be difficult to incorporate the lemon juice.    Using your fingers, spread a layer of herb butter under the loosened skin  of each hen. Spread a small amount on the skin. Tuck wings under the back  of the hen and set each hen on its side, breast down on a roasting rack  over a roasting pan.    Roast for 15 minutes, then turn hens to other side. Roast for another 15  minutes, then set hens on their backs with breast up and roast for a final  15 minutes (total cooking time about 45 minutes). Each time the hens are  turned, baste by spooning pan juices over the bird. Hens are fully cooked  when juices run clear and drumstick moves easily in its socket.    Remove birds to a warm platter and let sit for 5 minutes. Reduce pan juices  to a thin glaze consistency over high heat and serve as a sauce. (You may  want to flavor the pan juices with a little dry white wine.) Quarter birds  before serving. Each bird should serve two people.    NOTES:    *  Cornish game hens basted in tarragon butter -- This method of \"basting\"  fowl by spreading an herb butter under the skin infuses the meat with the  flavor of the herbs which usually is kept on the skin with normal external  basting.    *  This basting method can also be used when grilling, either over a  barbecue or in the broiler. I prefer barbecuing to oven roasting in the  summer (I tend to roast along with the birds) and prepare the birds a  little differently in this case. Rather than grilling whole, before the  butter is spread under the skin, each bird is split along the spine using a  sharp heavy knife. This is quite easy since the spine and ribs are easily  cut with moderately heavy pressure and rocking motion on the knife blade. I  then spread the bird, breast up, and crack the breast bone to flatten with  a sharp blow on the breast with the heel of my hand. The wings are tucked  under themselves and the legs and thighs left loose. The birds can be  cooked ahead of time and taken on a picnic or prepped in advance and  grilled at the picnic.    *  Margarine may be substituted for the butter without major noticeable  effects on the flavor.    *  In the summer, I like to serve either a tabbouleh or Italian tomato  salad (quartered RIPE tomatoes sprinkled with chopped fresh basil and  drizzled with olive oil) and a white zinfadel.    *  Since I like herb butters with all kinds of fish and fowl and have an  herb garden, I generally make up 2 cups or more of herb butter at a time,  using a food processor to assure thorough blending. The butter keeps well  in the fridge for 2-3 weeks.    : Difficulty:  moderate.  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Pamela McGarvey  : UCLA Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Los Angeles, California  : {hao,sdcrdcf}!cepu!pam    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust    ",
