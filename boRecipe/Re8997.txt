  "Instructions": "There are so many factors involved in pickling -- weather and growing  conditions, type of salt, acidity of vinegar, storage temperature,  time from gathering to pickling, processing -- that sometimes things  go wrong. Here are some common problems and causes.    1. SOFT OR SLIPPERY PICKLES: Could result from not removing the scum  from the surface of the brine; from not keeping the cucumbers  submerged in the brine; from using too weak of brine or vinegar,  using hard water, or not removing the blossom end of a cucumber; from  not sealing each jar as it is filled; from not heating long enough to  destroy microorganisms; or from storing in too warm a spot. Check  jars carefully for signs of spoilage.    2. SHRIVELED PICKLES: May be the result of too strong brine, vinegar,  syrup, or pickling solution, or may mean cucumbers didnt travel from  the field to the kitchen fast enough.    3. HOLLOW PICKLES: Could result from too long a time between pickling  and processing, from improper curing or too high a temperature during  fermentation, or from bad growing conditions.  Dont use any  cucumbers that float as you wash them.    4. DARK PICKLES: Indicate iron in the water or cooking utensil, ground  spices or whole spices left in jars, cooking too long with spices, or  hard water.    5. FADED, DULL  PICKLES: Result from poor growing conditions or too  mature cucumbers.    6. WHITE SEDIMENT IN THE BOTTOM OF JARS: It isnt harmful. It could  come from not using pure granulated salt, or could be the result of  fermentation. Check jars carefully for signs of spoilage.    7. SPOILED PICKLES: Means you didnt process them properly; that you  used old ingredients, nonstandard jars, or old lids; or that the  pickling solution wasnt boiling hot, or you filled too many jars  before sealing them. In other words, you didnt follow directions!  Check jars carefully for signs of spoilage.
