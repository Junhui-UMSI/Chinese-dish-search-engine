  "Instructions": "parchment paper; it eliminates the use of oil and cornmeal and cleaning  pans.    Bake the bagels on wooden boards (described earlier in directions). Place  bagels on the boards bottom side up to form a crusty bottom, and flip them  off the board after 2 or 3 minutes onto a stone or sheet to continue  baking.    Bake the bagels directly on a baking stone or tiles. Place the stone or  tiles on the lowest rack. Or line a baking sheet with the tiles and place  that on the lowest rack. Preheat the oven, with stone or tiles inside, to  400F. for 1 hour before baking. Sprinkle cornmeal on the stone or tiles.  Transfer unbaked bagels to the hot surface with a wooden peel (a  long-handled wooden paddle used in baking), or any flat instrument with a  long handle so you dont burn yourself; wear heavy padded gloves.    Do not wash or immerse stone or tiles in cold water while they are hot;  they may crack. Soak the cooled stone or tiles in cold water and scrape  with a spatula. Do not use soap, as the surfaces tend to absorb soap, which  will be imparted to the bagels. Stones and tiles will discolor, but that  wont affect their baking ability. Dont place a hot stone directly on your  kitchen counter; depending on the material, the heat could leave a mark.    Steam baking gives bagel tops a crisp crust and extra shine. Create steam  during the first few seconds of the baking by spraying the sides of the  preheated oven with water from a spray bottle when you place the bagels  inside. Place a heavy pan in the lower part of the oven bottom while it is  heating. Place the bagels in the oven and then pour cold water or half a  dozen ice cubes into the pan.    STORING AND USING BAGELS:    Bagels are best when theyre eaten fresh from the oven while still warm.  Because they dont usually contain egg or milk, they tend to dry out faster  than breads that contain these ingredients. If you cant consume all the  bagels in a reasonably short time, freezing them is recommended. Its smart  to slice them horizontally before freezing so you can toast only half at a  time, if you wish.    Thaw bagels on the kitchen counter in a plastic bag for about 15 minutes or  toast directly from the freezer. Or zap them in the microwave oven for  about 1 minute on DEFROST and then toast them until lightly browned on top.  Microwaving too long will make them tough.    What if a few bagels get stale? Put them into your blender or food  processor and grind them into bread crumbs. None of the tasty bread need  ever go to waste!    The Best Bagels are made at home by Dona Z.
