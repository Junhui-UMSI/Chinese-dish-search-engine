  "Instructions": "Filo dough (or leaves), is a tissue thin Greek pastry      dough made of  egg, flour and water. Filo can be found in almost all delicatessens or  gourmet shops. They are usually frozen when purchased. Just leave them in  the refrigerator for 24 hours or more until the leaves thaw out. Take out  only the amount called for in the       recipe and keep the rest well  wrapped. To prevent filo leaves from drying out while you work, lay out a  slightly damp cloth on the counter, then a sheet of        plastic wrap  over it. Place the leaves on top. Cover them first with a plastic wrap,  then with another slightly damp cloth. It is not a good idea to lay the  leaves directly on a damp cloth because the moisture       will turn the  dough soggy. Thats why the plastic wrap     is placed in between. Make  sure you have the filling       and all other ingredients ready. I find my  pastry          brush is a little too rough for brushing the oil on the  dough. Instead, I smooth oil on with my fingers. It goes much faster and  there is no problem of breakage. Even if you break a filo leaf, just glue  it      together with oil and it stays put by the time you         roll it  up. Of course, if you were doing western recipes, melted butter is the  usual moistening agent       between each leaf. Keep the wrapped triangles  or rolls moist by covering them with a plastic wrap. You can either bake  them or deep fry them. Ms. Yee prefers the     latter method as they are  much quicker to do and the       texture is crisper and lighter. Source:  \"Dim Sum\" by Rhoda Fong Yee.
