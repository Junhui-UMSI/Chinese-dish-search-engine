  "Instructions": "The Tahitian stuff is basically pretty simple fare, but it requires  all sorts of Tahitian veggies, fruits along with fish that I can only  find in pet stores around here.    There are some inconsistancies and maybe an incongruity or two in the  definition and spelling of the regional ingredients.  I copied them  directly out of the book, so taint my fault.  Most of these terms and  names have all the strange little marks over the vowels++much like  written Vietnamese.  I havent even attempted to replicate those.    The preparation of a ahimaa [Polynesian oven and its contents]  requires a considerable amount of work and time.    As most Tahitians nowadays have regular employment, they can seldom  spare the time to cook in this manner and the tamaaraa [meal]  around the traditional ahimaa is generally reserved for week-ends or  special occasions.    To prepare for about 40 people, the hole in the ground should measure  around 3 m long by 2 m wide by 0.80 m deep.    Line the bottom of the oven with dry wood placed crisscross to  facilitate the fire.    Completely cover the wood with a layer of volcanic stones.  Light the  fire and allow it to burn out almost completely, until the red hot  stones remain in the bottom of the oven.  Cover these with some green  branches and a bed of green banana leaves.  Season the pig and  chicken and lightly baste with oil before placing them on the bed of  leaves, together with all the other ingredients such as crayfish,  fish, vegetables, bananas and breadfruit, all wrapped individually in  leaves.    Cover the food with several layers of banana leaves, then a layer of  damp sacks before shoveling back enough sand or earth to fill the  oven.    Allow to cook for at least 3 hours.    The opening of the ahimaa is quite a ceremony among Tahitians and  all the guests usually assemble to witness the spectacle.  It is  surprising to find that all the ingredients are almost invariable  cooked to perfection, the pork usually has a golden crust and the  different dishes, despite having been cooked together in the same  oven retain their particular odour and flavour.
