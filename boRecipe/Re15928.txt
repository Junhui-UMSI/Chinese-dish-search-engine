  "Instructions": "REDUCE CHOLESTEROL ~ Use vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter  ~ Substitute 2 egg whites for 1 egg, or use egg substitute ~ Use more  vegetables and grains and less meat in recipe ~ Use soy-based product  to replace part of meat eg. tofu ~ Use nonfat milk products instead  of whole milk    REDUCE FAT CONTENT ~ Use reduced calorie mayonnaise and salad  dressing ~ Blend cottage cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream  topping ~ Replace regular whipping cream with low-cal topping or  yogurt ~ Remove visible fat from meat and skin from poultry before  cooking ~ Decrease oil in marinades and salad dressing; increase  vinegar, water and seasonings ~ Use foods canned in their own juice  or water ~ De-fat meat drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat  off the top ~ Decrease the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3  to 1/2 and increase fluids called for to reach desired consistency. ~  Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour  some of the fat off the top of \"natural\" peanut butters    REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~  Increase your use of herbs and spices in place of salt in recipes ~  Use fresh foods whenever possible in place of canned or processed  (soup mixes, cured meats etc) or rinse canned foods (tuna) with water  ~ Do not add salt to water when cooking pasta or other foods    REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in  traditional recipes by at least 1/3; substitute fruit juices, nectars  or pureed fruits. ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use  non caloric sweeteners if needed to increase the sweetness of a  recipe without added calories.  (Most baked desserts require at least  3/4 tsp. sugar per serving to achieve a desirable flavor.)    Adapted from Univ. of Calif. San Diego Healthy Diet For Diabetics c.  1990.
