  "Instructions": "Iceberg lettuce leaves, washed and crisped Parsley sprigs    If you are tired of serving the same old cheese ball for company  gatherings, maybe its time to add some sparkle to your appetizer  repertoire. Serve this zesty dip with crackers, chips or crudites.    Beat channa, minced shallot, hot peppers, garlic salt and wine (if using)  in a medium-size bowl until well mixed. If made ahead, cover and  refrigerate. May be made 1 day in advance.    To serve, mound on a plate lined with lettuce leaves. Garnish with parsley  sprigs.    Makes 1 1/2 cups.

From an article by Laxmi Hiremath in the San Francisco Chronicle, 9/1/93.    Other Cooking Methods    Freshly made paneer is delicious and may be eaten immediately, without  further preparation or adornment. However, in most recipes, paneer must be  cooked before it is added to the other ingredients. Broiling, which is  discussed in the story, is the method I prefer because very little oil is  used. If you dont wish to broil the cheese, here are a few alternatives:    Toaster Oven: Grease a small baking tray with vegetable oil. Place paneer  cubes on the tray and brush with oil. Bake at 400 degrees F. until golden  brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and use in any cooked paneer recipe.    For a quick paneer curry, place cooked cheese cubes on a heated serving  platter and pour your favorite curry sauce over them. Garnish with minced  cilantro and serve.    Barbecue Grill: Prepare a charcoal fire to the gray-ash stage. Gently blow  away the ash, leaving coals that glow cherry red. Cut paneer into 2-inch  cubes. Brush skewers and paneer cubes with vegetable oil. Thread evenly on  skewers leaving 1/2-inch space any cooked paneer recipe.    For, an exotic appetizer, sprinkle grilled paneer cubes with. lemon juice  and ground cumin. Place on a warmed platter and served immediately.    Saute; Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy nonstick pan or wok over  medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add paneer cubes and saute until light  brown, turning once. Carefully transfer to paper towels to drain. Tent with  foil to keep warm until ready to use. Use in any recipe calling for cooked  paneer.    Note: A nonstick pan is essential; the paneer will break and crumble in any  other pan.    Deep Fry: Heat 6 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil to 350 degrees F.  in a nonstick wok until hot but not smoking. Gently add Paneer cubes. Do  not crowd. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Tent with foil to keep  warm until ready to use. Use in any recipe calling for cooked paneer.    From an article by Laxmi Hiremath in the San Francisco Chronicle, 9/1/93.    ",
