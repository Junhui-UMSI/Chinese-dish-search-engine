  "Instructions": ": Continued from Part 1    NOTES:    *  Delicious Northern Chinese snack and hackers staple -- Hackers on both  coasts and most places in between love potstickers (though if youre from  the Right Coast, you probably know them as Peking Ravioli, or just ravs.  This recipe is based on one found in Chef Chus Distinctive Cuisine of  China. Total preparation time is about 45 minutes. They dont come out as  good as the ones from Chos in Mountain View, but if you dont happen to be  within 45 minutes of Mountain View, theyll do very nicely, thank you.  Yield:  Makes about 2 dozen.    *  You can freeze uncooked potstickers for later use, if you squeeze out  the water from the cabbage during preparation (in a colander or  cheesecloth). Freeze potstickers separately on cookie sheets until firm,  then put them in plastic bags. When rolling out the pancakes, leave the  centers slightly thicker than the edges. A thicker center will hold up  better during the browning.    *  If you prefer, steam potstickers for about 12 minutes over boiling water  instead of pan-frying.  (No self-respecting hacker would be caught eating  steamed potstickers, though.)    *  These are really not hard to make, and come out quite nicely! Following  the dough recipe above leads to a fairly dry and floury dough; this makes  it hard to roll out and pleat. Feel free to add a little more water. There  are also now commercially available potsticker presses that take care of  folding and pleating; theyre cheap and plastic and work rather well.    *  The perfect potsticker is uniformly brown with a thick brown area on the  bottom (where it sticks to the pot); it seems that achieving this only  comes with practice. I tend to fry both sides a bit before adding the  water; this helps. Beware of too much heat; the bottom will bubble and  crack.  This doesnt taste any different, but doesnt look as nice.    *  If you dont cook the whole batch at once, store the potstickers so that  they dont touch; the dough tends to stick to itself, so the potstickers  may tear as you remove them.    *  Many restaurants serve Hoy Sin sauce (hoisin) instead of hot sauce.    : Difficulty:  moderate.  : Time:  45 minutes.  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.    : Chris Kent  : DEC Western Research Lab, Palo Alto, California  : kent@decwrl.DEC.COM    {ihnp4,ucbvax,decvax}!decwrl!kent    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust    ",
