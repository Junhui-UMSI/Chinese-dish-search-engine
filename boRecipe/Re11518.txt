  "Instructions": "Cook the berries for 15 minutes in the water - until they are quite soft.  Press through a fine strainer; add to the fruit juice the sugar and the  vanilla scraped out of a slit bean, bring to a boil in a non-reactive pot,  and reduce while stirring vigorously. Add the dissolved cornstarch to the  sweetened fruit juice.  Bring to a boil once more, then transfer the  Rodegruett to a glass baking dish that has been rinsed with cold water.  Chill in the refrigerator and serve.    Note:    Nowadays it is more customary to serve Rodegruett in individual bowls  rather than a giant family-size trencher. Serve with cream, cold milk, or  cold Vanilla Sauce which only should be poured over the groats before  youre ready to eat.    Make sure the groats are not too thick.  The correct consistency is  somewhere between that of a pudding and a puree (like thick pea soup). When  you first taste Rodegruett made according to these specifications, it may  easily seem too sweet or the berry flavor may seem a little overwhelming.  However, bear in mind that after the groats have cooled off a bit and  milk or cream has been poured over them, the taste will be considerably  milder.    Variations:    Some or all of the strained berry pulp may be replace with an equivalent  amount of fruit juice, and quick-frozen berries or preserves will do just  about as well as fresh ones. Cherries, morellos (sour cherries), and black  currants are often used instead of or in addition to red currants and  raspberries. Many cooks like to hold back some portion of the berries until  after the straining so they dont cook down like the others and you can  still taste them while eating the dish.    Tapioca is often used as a binding agent, and there are those who maintain  that this is the only authentic method of making Rodegruett. In Saxony  and East Prussia, red griats have been made with farina (semolina) for a  number of years now, and since the words for farina (Griess) and groats  (Gruetze) are closely related, sometimes even used interchangeably, it is  no less possible that this is in fact the original version. All questions  of authenticity aside, a deluxe fortified Rodegruett can be made by  stewing the berries in red wine or with some higher-proof alcoholic  beverage.    Makes 4 to 6 servings.
