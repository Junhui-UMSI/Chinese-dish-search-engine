  "Instructions": "- Peppercorn Substitutes -    \"Peppercorns are used throughout the world, in every kind of cuisine. Where  berries of P. nigrum arent available, the following peppers or pepperlike  fruits are sometimes substituted.    \"Cubeb pepper (P. cubeba), also known as the tailed pepper, is grown in  Indonesia, Java, Malaysia, and the West Indies. It has a burning, bitter  taste and was the first variety of pepper to travel from Asia to the  Mediterranean.  It is an ingredient of the Moroccan spice blend called ras  el hanout.    \"Long pepper (P. longum) is related to black pepper both botanically and in  taste.  The fruit, which grows on a vine similar to that of P. nigrum, is  harvested when green and about an inch long. The flavor is very much like  that of black pepper, though less pungent and slightly sweet. In the Far  East, it is always used whole to flavor stews, preserves, and pickles.\"    \"Pink or red peppercorns are from shrubs or small trees (Schinus spp.),  mostly native to South America, which are not related to P. nigrum. Some  species of these trees are grown in warmer parts of the United States. The  fruits have bright red-pink, paper-thin casings enclosing dark brown  berries.  The flavor of the berries is mild, though slightly pungent, with  a hint of sweetness. The Food and Drug Administration, concerned about the  allergic reactions of some people to Schinus berries, removed them from the  market for a time in the early 1980s. Now pink peppercorns from Reunion,  an island in the Indian Ocean belonging to France, are available without  any warnings. We have heard of reactions ranging from rashes to nausea but  have not been able to find information on quantities consumed or profiles  of the victims. Both of us have eaten pink peppercorns occasionally and in  moderate amounts for years without adverse reactions. Those concerned about  possible allergies should consume pink peppercorns with care (you might try  eating _one_ as a test) or avoid them entirely.    \"Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum piperitum) is also known as Szechuan,  Japanese, or anise pepper, or fagara. This deciduous tree or shrub,  unrelated to P. nigrum, is native to Japan, Korea, and northern China. Each  reddish-brown dried fruit contains a bitter black seed which is discarded  before use.  The dried fruits are a peppery, pungent spice, an essential  ingredient of the Chinese five-spice mixture (which also includes star  anise, cassia or cinnamon, fennel seeds, and cloves.)\"    From Susan Belsinger and Carolyn Dilles \"Peppercorns Around the World\"  article in \"The Herb Companion.\" Dec. 1992/Jan. 1993, Vol. 5, No. 2. Pg.  45.  Posted by Cathy Harned.    ",
