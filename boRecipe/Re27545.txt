  "Instructions": "Thaw turkey (if frozen) on Monday & Tuesday in refrigerator.    On Wednesday, put 3 onions (cut up), 4 garlic cloves (sliced) and 1  large bunch of parsley in cavity of bird.    Pour Vernors (ginger ale) and 8 oz orange juice concentrate in cavity.  Cover and rub bird with Catalina dressing. Sprinkle with seasoned  salt and pepper and paprika.  I put the whole mess in a garbage bag and  marinate it overnight.    Before baking, discard all marinade.    \r\n\r\nDi Note:  When I finally bought my house, I wanted to have Thanksgiving  here instead of at my mothers (which was traditional).  I had NEVER  done a turkey before.  I bought this HUGE creature and started to  do the marinade thing (my Moms recipe).  Well, I dont have much  counter space and this bird was a slipping an sliding all over the  place and I was laughing hysterically.  I was actually fighting this  monster!  My Mom called to see how everything was going and all she  could hear was me cackeling.  She jumped in her car and came over and  here I was, on the floor with this damn bird in my lap and marinade  all over me. It was one of those moments...great marinade tho!
