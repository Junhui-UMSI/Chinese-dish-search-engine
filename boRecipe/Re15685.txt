  "Instructions": "If you do not wish to handle lye, do not have wood ashes available, or do  not have the time to make soap from scratch, you can still make homemade  soaps.  You can purchase castille granules at most drugstores. There is no  need to mess with lye when using these granules. Since they are actually  granulated soap, it is easy to make soap from them.    Put the granules into a kettle and add water. Instructions for use will  probably be on the package. If not, use common sense in adding water.  (Dont drown the granules.) Heat the mixture at low to medium heat and stir  it constantly with a large wooden spoon. The granules will dissolve. Stir  the mixture until it is smooth. Remove it from the heat and add any other  ingredients or emolients that you want. Stir them in well as the soap  cools.  Add perfume (if desired) as they very last ingredient. Blend it in  so that the fragrance will be evenly dispersed. Pour the mixture into  molds, and let harden. If the soap does not set (that is, if the bars do  not get hard) reheat the mixture, adding more castille granules as  necessary. Before it cools completely, you will need to add more perfume  because reheating the mix will release the volatile floral oils, thus  destroying them.
