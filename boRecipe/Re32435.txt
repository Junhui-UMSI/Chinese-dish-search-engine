  "Instructions": "Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and  Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn tortillas  were to the Aztecs.    Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela continued to  use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of nourishment. Today,  these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for the rich and poor alike, a  heart-warming tribute to simplicity, tradition, versatility, and good  taste.    Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked  overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained and  ground into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a pre-cooked harina  de masa is now available at most Latin American markets. An instant masa  can be made by simply mixing this corn flour (either white or yellow) with  a little salt and enough boiling water to make a stiff dough.    The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses,  depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried. In  parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is first  heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty -- arepas de  chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of banana leaves.    Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan counterparts.  The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a flat bread roll, crispy  on the outside and doughy on the inside. They can be split open and  buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh goat cheese. Made this way,  they are served for breakfast or as an accompaniment for grilled fowl,  fish, meat stews, or sausages.    In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the shell is  filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef, ham, chicken,  seafood, vegetables, or beans. They are excellent first courses. Venezuelan  mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped into rings and deep-fried.  Another specialty is bollos pelones -- balls of arepa dough stuffed with  seasoned ground meat, either fried or poached in water, then served with  tomato sauce.    A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh cheese and  fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups using fresh masa  or leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great desserts.    The versatile arepa indeed proves that unpretentioius food can be not only  satisfying but also delicious.    Directions:    In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add water, stir with a  wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 minutes, then knead for  3 minutes. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard arepas, or to be mixed  and kneaded with other ingredients such as cheese, chicharrones (pork  rind), etc.    To shape arepas: The standard Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4  inch thick. Columbian arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in  diameter, 1/4 inch thick. To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and  shape dough into balls. Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap  and flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc.    To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat;  grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of times  until a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be served at this  point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to be baked in a preheate  350-degree oven for 15 minutes. To check for doneness, tap the arepa  lightly -- if a hollow sound is heard, its ready. Split open, add butter  and serve hot.    Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm. Freeze in layers separated  by plastic wrap. Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum foil in a  preheated 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until heared through.
