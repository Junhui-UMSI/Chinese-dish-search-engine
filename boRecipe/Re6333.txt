  "Instructions": "Green (underripe) plantains are extremely similar to potatoes, so Ill  stick in a brief word about them here. Plantains, as I see it, are  somewhere in-between potatoes and bananas in taste and texture. When  theyre green, they are much more like potatoes, but as they ripen they  resemble bananas more and more in taste and texture. My plantains ripened  on me once, and I tried to cook them anyway; it was disgusting. Im sure  there are recipes for ripe plantains, but I dont know of any, so my advice  is to buy them green and cook them soon. Peeling a green plantain can be  tough, as the skin doesnUt separate easily. Nonetheless, it must be done,  and itUs worth it. Then cut the plantains into small chunks and cover them  with water (they turn black if you dont.)  Heat some oil in a pan. Add  some black mustard seeds and cumin seeds, and when the seeds start popping  add in the plantain chunks. Sprinkle them with some turmeric, salt, black  pepper, and perhaps some cayenne. Fry them until crisp. Another way to cook  plantains (_green_ plantains) is to deep-fry them like potato chips. Cut  them into 1/4 inch slices, sprinkle them with cayenne and ginger (or  nothing), and deep fry them until the outside is crisp but the inside is  soft.  Test-fry a few until you get the method right. Ive also heard of  something called a potocan (sp?) or a toston (sp?), which is a plantain  deep-fried whole, then mashed and deep-fried again, and then covered with  meats, nuts, vegetables, whatever. However, I have yet to come across a  vegetarian recipe (or any recipe, for that matter) for something to go on  the toston.
