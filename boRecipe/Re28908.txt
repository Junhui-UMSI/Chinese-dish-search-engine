  "Instructions": "This recipe is very simple,very fast and very good.  The fresh rice  noodles, thick and white, can be found in the refrigerator cabinet of  any good Asian grocery store.  Dont use frozen marinara mix++the  recipe deserves better.  Any decent fishmonger will be happy to serve  you with half a dozen prawns, a few scallops, some squid, a small  fillet of fish, a handful of mussels or any other combination that  appeals to you.    Cut 500 g of mixed seafood into bite-size pieces, first removing any  shells.  If you are using mussels, wash and scrape the shells and  open them by putting them in a pot with a little boiling water.  Cover and boil for a few minutes, removing each mussel as it opens to  prevent overcooking.    Chop a handful of basil leaves and seed and finely slice 3 birds eye  chillies.    In a frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil.  Brown 2  tablespoons of crushed garlic and saute the seafood for a couple of  minutes. Drain off the oil and set the garlic seafood mixture aside.    Put another tablespoon of oil in the pan and increase the heat.  Add 2  tablespoons of light soya sauce and the noodles and saute for 2-3  minutes. Tip the seafood back into the pan and add 3 tablespoons of  fish sauce. Stir well.  Add the basil leaves and chillies and cook  for 1 minute more, stirring.  Serve,    Makes 3 to 4 servings.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; November 17 1992.
