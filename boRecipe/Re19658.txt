  "Instructions": "1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar          2 tb ground cinnamon          4    eggs, well beaten    Ice cream    Ok, the night before you want to make this (or in the morning...), take the  ice cream and scoop it into balls (tennis ball size).  Make sure the balls  of ice cream are solid, no air pockets.  You will likely have to use your  hands.  Place them in a shallow pan that you can put into the freezer  (lined with wax paper).  Freeze overnight, or at least 6 hours.    Next, combine the crushed cornflakes, sugar and cinnamon in a large (gallon  size) ziplock bag.  Put the beaten eggs into a bowl.    Take the ice cream balls and coat them with the cornflake mixture, really  pressing it into the surface of the ball.  Then, dip the whole thing into  the egg mixture and re-coat it with cornflakes.  Return to the freezer for  at least 2 hours.  Make sure there are no \"bald spots\" anywhere on the ice  cream ball.  You might need to dip into the egg and re-coat with the  cornflakes one more time.  Freeze for at LEAST 2 hours before you are going  to fry.    Use a good deep fryer, and heat it to a fairly high temperature (I dont  know exactly how hot this is, I never measured....). Immediately before you  want to serve, remove one ice cream ball from the freezer at a time, and  drop into the hot oil (use canola....) for about 30 seconds, or until it  just begins to brown.  Take it out of the oil and put in a bowl to serve.  Top with really good stuff like hot fudge (lots....really lots...oh, sorry,  Im thinking about this too much), whipped cream, nuts, anything else that  you might deem appropriate.    The shell should be cooked and crunchy, and the inside will still be frozen  (amazing, isnt it?).  You can only cook one at a time, so if you have a  whole bunch to make, use more than one fryer.  Let the oil return to the  high temperature before you add the next ball.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #196    Date: Sun, 14 Jul 1996 00:59:07 -0500    From: pickell@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)",
