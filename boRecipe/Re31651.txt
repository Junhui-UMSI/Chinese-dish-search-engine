  "Instructions": "Grease & flour 2 baking sheets.  Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt,  & vanilla in a large bowl. Beat (at medium speed if a mixer is used) until  egg whites hold soft peaks. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar, a tablespoon at a  time, beating continuously. Continue beating until meringue is very stiff  and dull. It has been beaten enough when a bit, rubbed between thumb &  finger, is no longer grainy.  The meringue should be stiff enough to hold  its shape when formed with a pastry tube. Gently fold in remaining sugar.    Meringues should actually be dried rather than baked. Herein lies the  secret of making meringues which are tender, delicate, and light-colored,  rather than overly crisp, tough, and too dark to be either attractive or  delicious.  The best meringues are baked by the following method:    Set oven teperature at 200 degrees before beginning to beat the egg whites.  After shaping the meringue mixture on baking sheets, place in the preheated  oven for 15 minutes. Then turn off the oven heat. Allow the meringues to  remain in the oven with the heat rurned off for at least 4-5 hours -- the  longer the better. If your oven has a pilot light, the meringues will be  ready a little sooner.  The meringues should be totally dry before removing  them from the oven.  If you can, leave them in the oven overnight.    For many of us, however, time is a factor.  If you cant take the time to  bake meringues this slow, slow way, accept second best & simply bake them  slowly, setting the oven temperature for 200 degrees or less if possible.  At 200 degrees, meringue layers will need to bake for about 40 minutes;  small meringues may take a little less time.    Whatever method you use, it is important to prevent the meringues from  coloring, since even a light tan color changes their texture and taste as  well as their appearance.    When thoroughly dry, meringues can be kept covered in a dry airy place (NOT  in a tightly covered box) for several weeks.    ALTERNATE MIXING METHOD by ELECTRIC BEATER    Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla in  large bowl.  Beat at high speed until egg whites hold peaks. Add 1/2 cup  sugar, all at once. Beat at high speed until mixture is very stiff and  there are no grains of undisolved sugar. Fold in remaining sugar.    To shape Swiss Meringue into layers and rounds follow directions given  below.    Grease and flour a large baking sheet.  Press the rim of a 9-inch layer  cake pan or a 2-inch cooky cutter lightly into the flour on baking sheet to  make guides. If Baking Pan Liner Paper is used, the guiding circles will  have to be traced with a pencil.  Spread mixture within circles. OR: Fill a  pastry bag fitted with a No.3 or 5 tube with prepared mixture. Starting in  center of each circle, press out bater in a long, continuous, pencil-thick  strip, curling it round & round until traced circle is completely filled in  (spiral).  For best control, press out batter slowly, holding bag at least        1    inch away from sheet.    Bake in a 325 degree oven, 25 minutes for small rounds, 35-40 minutes for  9-inch layers.    ",
