  "Instructions": "THE PERFECT BUTTERMILK BISCUIT Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a great Southern  cook from Avery Plantation, La., Ive learned to make the best Buttermilk  Biscuits Ive ever had. Eula Mae says a good biscuit is one of the best  things to have on hand for quick meals. She uses them in emergencies to  make simple sandwiches filled with scraps of ham or cheese and serves them  with pickles and a small salad. For dessert, she warms a biscuit or two and  makes a shortcake with fresh fruits or berries. She has convinced me that  you cant have too many biscuits on hand. Eula Mae learned to cook and bake  from her grandmother, not from cookbooks, and the artfulness of her  preparation was a joy to watch. Here are some of her biscuit-making tips: +  First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you bought it within  the last four months. More baking flops occur from old, tired baking powder  than from any other cause. And dont rely on the old test of checking the  freshness of baking powder by putting a spoonful in a glass of water to see  if it fizzes. Baking powder, like a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and  still be almost flat. Buying new baking powder costs very little when you  consider the cost of baking failures. + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting  the dry ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I  tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does make a  slightly higher, more tender biscuit. + After you cut the biscuit dough,  put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down. This ensures a taller,  lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by the pressure of the  cutting dont interfere with the rise. (The French use the same trick when  making puff pastry.) + The tip that helped me the most was using less flour  than usual. Eula Maes dough was soft and sticky. She handled it gently,  dusting her hands and the dough with only enough flour to make the dough  manageable. The result was a lighter biscuit.
