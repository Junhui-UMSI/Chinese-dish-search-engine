  "Instructions": "There must be seven vegetables, never fewer - usually onion, carrot, green  peppers, courgettes, turnip, white cabbage, aubergine. An eighth is  essential, tomato.    The lamb, too, is crucial. Tender 2 month old lamb is best, because it is  tender. It is skinny. It has no fat, but is has the flavour of the herbs it  feeds on, thyme, rosemary, wild fennel.    Basically, everything cooks in the pot for an hour, but the hard vegetables  go in first and the tender vegetables for the last 20 minutes. Thats it.  It cooks at a rolling boil, and theres the rub. For the last half hour,  the couscous has to be cooked in a colander above it, where it steams.    We have problems trying to mimic this. For a start, we cant buy the  quality of couscous he uses; one which readily takes on the flavours of the  stew steaming underneath, and absorbs a certain amount of butter.    Most couscous sold in Britain, and France too, is pre-cooked, so follow the  instructions on the packet. (Note, if it is too robustely steamed it will  cook to a mush suitable only for invalids.) But for interest, should you be  able to obtain authentic grain, this is how he cooks it. (Middle Eastern  shops should stock it. It has a gutsy texture and character.)    This is what Monsieur Boujeema Mars, eminent chef des cuisines, La  Mamounia, Marrakech, Morrocco, does: There are three stages. He wets 12  ounces of couscous with one cup of water only. He lines a colander (which  fits over his stew pan) with muslin, and put the couscous inside. Using the  muslin, he ensures a tight seal between pan and colander. He places the lid  loosely on top and steams the couscous for 10 minutes. He removes the  colander, stirs in a knob of butter, adds another cup of water, and steams  it a further ten minutes. He repeats the process a third time, making the  cooking time 30 minutes in all.
