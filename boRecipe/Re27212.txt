  "Instructions": "STORING AND FREEZING COOKIES: 1). Separate soft and crisp textured cookies  for storage. Soft cookies should be kept in tightly covered containers.  Crisp cookies may be stored in a cookie jar or container with loose fitting  lid in a dry climate. In humid climate, store crisp cookies in a tightly  covered container.   2). If soft cookies begin to dry out, add a piece of apple or bread to the  container to help them retain moisture. If crisp cookies become soggy and  are not decorated, heat in a 300~ oven for 3-5 minutes to crisp them.   3). Store frosted cookies and thumb print cookies in a single layer in a  tightly covered container. If need be for space, layer cookies between  waxed paper to protect.   4). Bar cookies may be stored, tightly covered, in baking pan. Some may  require refrigeration because of ingredients in them.   5). Unbaked cookie dough can be refrigerated for up to one week or frozen  for up to 6 weeks. Rolls of dough should be sealed tightly in plastic wrap;  other doughs should be stored in airtight containers.   6). Crisp cookies freeze better than soft cookies. Bars and brownies are  an exception to this rule since they freeze extremely well.     7). Freeze unfrosted cookies from 9-12 months. Separate layers with waxed  paper or plastic wrap.   8). Freeze frosted cookies uncovered until they are firm. Then pack them  in airtight container lined with plastic wrap or foil. They can be frozen  for 2-3 months.   9). Cardboard containers are not recommended for storage as the flavor and  aroma from the box may be absorbed by the cookies.   10). Frozen cookies thaw in about 10 minutes at room temperature.    ",
