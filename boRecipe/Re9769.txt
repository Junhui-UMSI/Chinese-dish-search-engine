  "Instructions": "Recently I was at a local restaurant and found they had pumpkin soup, made  without butter!  It was rather like eating hot, liquid pumpkin pie. I asked  for the recipe, and here it is.    I recommend accompanying it with a nice sourdough bread or something  similar.    Cook a medium sized pumpkin, using any method with which you are  comfortable.  The new honey pumpkins now available are really great for  this purpose!  Scoop out the cooked pumpkin, and blend it in the blender  adding non-fat milk or rice dream until the desired thickness is reached.  Return to a pan and season with cinammon, clove, nutmeg and/or pumpkin pie  spice to taste. I dont specify measurements because everyone has a  different idea of how much of these kinds of spices to use. Heat on low  until desired temperature is reached.    For a really special treat, froth up non-fat milk (sweetened if desired)  with a capuccino machine steam thingy, and float mounds on the top of the  soup with pumpkin pie spices on top.    I apologize for the randomness of this recipe, but this is the way it was  given to me, and I find myself experimenting with it often, changing  spices, adding maple syrup for a desert soup, adding thickener for a  pumpking pudding variation.  Its great for a cold night pick-me-up, and  kids love it!    Posted by Shoshana Edwards <bree@netcom.com> to the Fatfree Digest [Volume       13    Issue 30] Dec. 30, 1994.
