  "Instructions": "Sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata) is in the Umbelliferae family. Its a hardy  perennial with a scent thats been compared to lovage and which has also  been described as having a spicy flavor like licorice. Sweet cicely can be  substituted for caraway seeds in baking. Press fresh sweet cicely leaves  firmly into bluefish before grilling them, or grate the root and add it to  quick breads and muffins.  Anise can be substituted for sweet cicely.    Flowers are white, numerous, 2\" across and are in compound umbels of 5 to  10 smaller umbels.  Inner blooms are male and outer blooms are bisexual.  The leaves are fernlike, two or three times pinnately divided and in  toothed or finely lobed leaflets.  They are whitish, downy and spotted  underneath.  Leaf stalks wrap around the stem. The fruit is shiny, dark  brown and the seeds are sharply ridged and to 1\" long. The plant flowers in  May and June and is native to Europe and naturalized in North America. Its  hardy to Zone 3 and prefers moist, well-drained, humusy soil and partial  shade.    Rodale writes:  \"Heres an herb that seems to have made it onto everyones  Most Often Overlooked list, but not into very many gardens. Although some  gardeners have found it difficult to propagate, it will reward the  persistent with a beautiful ornamental form, a sweet anise taste and a few  medicinal uses.    \"Although the plant has been in use in cooking and medicine at least since  Roman times, little seems to have been written about it. Indeed, the old  herbalists spent most of their words in comparing it to other plants like  hemlock, chervil, lovage and anise.  It was used as a preventative in time  of plague, as a tonic for young girls and old people, and as an aromatic, a  stomachic, a carminative and an expectorate.    \"Uses: Medicinal: Sweet cicely is employed in folk medicine in some parts  of the world, but its uses have not been tested scientifically. It does  seem to increase appetite and decrease flatulence, and we know that the  roots are antiseptic.  All seem to agree that it is harmless, which in a  way seems to be damning it with faint praise.\"    \"Culinary: Sweet cicelys flavor is a combination of celery and anise. The  leaves of the plant are used fresh as garnishes, in salads or in recipes  where a sweet touch is needed. The root is steamed, simmered or cooked and  pureed like a parsnip, and the seeds are used in candy, syrups, cakes and  liqueurs.    \"Sweet cicely cooperates with carrots, parsnips, potatoes, turnips,  Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cream soups and sauces, and fish, and in fruit  soups, stewed fruit, fruit salads, pies and tarts.    \"Ornamental: The lacy foliage and large white blossoms that bloom in spring  make it a good plant for mixed flower beds. The seeds are decorative enough  for winter bouquets.\"    \"Cultivation:  If possible, start from purchased or dug seedling plants, or  divide the plant in the fall. The seed needs to have undergone rather  mysterious patterns of freeze and thaw and is notoriously slow and finicky  about germinating.  If you do use it, use fresh seed and sow in the fall.    \"Harvesting and storage: Harvest leaves throughout their growing season.  One plant will yield 4 cups of leaves and 1/2 cup of seeds in a season.  Plant parts are seldom dried.\"    From _Rodales Illustrated Encyclopedia of Herbs_, Claire Kowalchik and  William H. Hylton, Editors. Emmaus, PA: Rodale Press, Inc., 1987. Pg. 474.  ISBN 0-87857-699-1. Electronic format by Cathy Harned.    ",
