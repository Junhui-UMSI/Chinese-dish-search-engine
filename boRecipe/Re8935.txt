  "Instructions": "From: dan@clark.net (Dan Eisenreich) (COLLECTION)    Date: 4 May 1994 02:46:47 GMT  Also, it is not necessary to can the rhubarb in order to preserve it. It  can be frozen. Wash it, trim off the bottom and top of the stalks, and cut  it into 1-inch pieces. Put about 4 or 5 cups of it into a plastic bag and  freeze. (If you wish to use th frozen rhubarb in the following jam recipe,  freeze it in packages containing only 2 cups of rhubarb, and you will  probably want to cut it into smaller pieces too.) To defrost, microwave it  at 70% power for 3 to 5 minutes. Use while it is still slightly frozen.    Freezing it removes the concerns about safety and proper canning  techniques. If you want some rhubarb/strawberry jam this winter, defrost  your frozen rhubarb, buy a pint of frozen strawberries (or use some you  have frozen yourself), toss them into the following recipe, and 30 minutes  later you have jam. And it is probably better than canned jam that you make  this spring.    Also, for the benefit of novice cooks out there, only the stalk of the  rhubarb plant can be eaten. The roots and leaves are highly poisonous. To  prepare fresh rhubarb: rinse well, remove the leaves and roots, and trim  off the tops and bottoms of the stal s. Then use as the recipe directs.  BTW, fresh rhubarb is bitter and tough. It is almost always cooked. In  fact, I dont recall ever seeing a recipe that uses raw rhubarb.
