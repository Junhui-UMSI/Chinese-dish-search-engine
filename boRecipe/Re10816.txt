It was posted by Deborah Madison the cookbook author  of THE SAVORY WAY and restaurant chef.\" Madison wrote: \"Quinces are, for  me, the queen of fall fruits.    \"Quinces are intensely fragrant, with a perfume like a mingling of pears  and apples. Your farmers market may be your best bet for finding this  golden fruit. It lasts for a long time and once you have some quince  compote on hand you will be happy to discover its many uses.    \"The quince is a marvelous, ancient fruit that is found in many parts of  the world, from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe, to South America, the  U.S., Mexico and onward. Closely related to apples and pears, the quince  looks something like a combination of the 2--like a lumpy, pear-shaped  apple with a golden skin, which is sometimes covered with a soft down.\"  \"The best thing about the quince, though, is its perfume, which is rich and  heady, suggestive of narcissus as well as pears and apples. A single ripe  quince placed on a bureau can do wonders for a room as well.    \"A properly matured quince will be a rich golden hue and very perfumed.  Unfortunately most commercial quinces are picked too green so they never  develop the color and perfume they should have. Look in farmers markets  for the real thing. You can also find quince trees in peoples yards, for  the fruit stays on in the fall, long after the leaves have dropped, making  them easy to spot.    \"Most people dont know what to do with them and can be persuaded to part  with a few for the asking.\" \"Unlike apples and pears, quince must be  cooked. Eat it raw, and your mouth will pucker. But cooked, it is quite  versatile and delicious. Since it is full of pectin, it lends itself very  well to the making of preserves, but can also be cooked with meat and fish  (as in Moroccan recipes) and is wonderful poached in a syrup spiced with  cinnamon and clove. Once poached, it turns a luscious shade of pink and can  be served by itself, with cream cheeses, in a compote, or with apples and  pears in pies, tarts and other dishes.    \"Quinces are usually peeled before cooking.

Poached in a heavy syrup, they will keep very well for a month  or 2 refrigerated.\" From THE SAVORY WAY by Deborah Madison. New York:  Bantam Books, 1990. From: howard_w@iat.holonet.net (Howard E.
