  "Instructions": "Pour the water into a large bowl. Add about 3 cups of the flour and mix  well. Beatthe dough for about 100 strokes, or until it becomes elastic.  Gradually add enough of the remaining flour to make a kneadable dough.     Turn the dough out onto agenerously floured surface and knead in enough  flour to make a firm and nonsticky dough. Knead the dough vigorously for 20  minutes. If kneading becomes too difficult for you, try pounding the dough  with a rolling pin or with your fists.     Continue kneading and/or pounding the dough until it becomes very smooth  and elastic. To make sure that the dough is kneaded enough, break off a  small piece and wash it. If it is sufficiently kneaded, the starch will  wash away, leaving the elastic gluten.     The next step is washing or rinsing the dough. Fill a large bowl with  room-temperature water (use the same bowl you used to mix the dough). Place  the bowl in the sink and place the dough in the bowl. Work the dough by  rubbing it and sqsueezing it between your hands with a motion similar to  that of washing clothes.   Dont worry if the dough falls apart, because it will come back together  as it is washed.     When the water becomes very cloudy, pour (with the dough) through a  colander. If you want to save the starch water, place an empty bowl under  the colander to catch it. Repeat this squeezing and rinsing process until  the rinse water is practically clear and the dough resembles a large,  elastic wad of chewing gum.   You now have raw gluten.     Use the raw gluten to make seitan.     Makes  1 1/2 to 2 cups     from the files of DEEANNE    ",
