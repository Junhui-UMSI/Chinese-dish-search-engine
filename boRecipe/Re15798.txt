  "Instructions": "The best resource on Miso that I know of is Shurtleff and Aoyagis book  _The Book of Miso_.  Its quite a complex subject.  The differences is miso  can be attributed to a variet of factors, from the proportion of  ingredients, cooking techniques, and duration and temperature of  fermentation.  The redish color comes from long fermentation times (or in  cheap imitations, from dyes).  The whiter misos are generally fermented for  short times, and often made with rice in addition to soybeans. Reds are  generally saltier and whites sweeter.    Misos vary widely in fat content (like most soy products) and generally  range from .25 to 1.5 gram of fat per tablespoon (and from about 6%CFF to  over 30%CFF).  Some varieties, like peanut miso, obviously have even more  fat.  Since it is rare that a dish has more than 1 T miso per serving, miso  does not generally add appreciable fat to a dish. Many of the white sweet  misos clock in at the low end (.25 grams per T, 6-10%CFF) so if you do want  to use more miso, these kinds can be added liberally to a dish (and since  their taste isnt as strong or salty, they do become many dishes in greater  quantity).    I find the dark, hearty misos make great gravy starters.  Add a bit of  water/stock, some nutritional yeast, spices and a thickener to some miso  and voila, instant delicious gravy.  A favorite miso-potato recipe follows.    ~- Michelle Dick artemis@rahul.net    On miso, you just have to try different kinds & brands.  There are numerous  styles of miso.  Red misos tend to be more \"savory\" and white ones are  usually more \"sweet\".  Country-style (Inaka) is made grainier on purpose.  If served as a sauce on veggies, probably its not straight miso but mixed  w/sugar and some rice vinegar.  BTW a warning to vegetarians, some misos  come \"dashi-iri\" which includes fish-based stock.  I think the ingredients  label in English will mention fish, but not sure (since I can read the  Japanese, I dont usually check the English), so check the ingredients  carefully.  There is kombu-dashi (I even found some granulated packets)  which is vegetarian, but most dashi is from bonito flakes (I guess it must  be cheaper).    Aiko P.
