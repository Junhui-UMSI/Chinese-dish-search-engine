  "Instructions": "~ -- Thai fish sauce, called nam pla. This amber-colored, odoriferous  liquid - -- used in everything from stir-frys to sauces -- cooks down to a  mellow undertone. Better brands are lighter colored and less pungent; Squid  is a recommended brand.    ~ -- Dried shrimp. Salty and intensely flavored, these are used primarily  as a seasoning ingredient. Usually sold in 4-ounce packages, dried shrimp  should be plump and resilient, retaining enough moisture to evidence a  little \"give\" when squeezed.    ~ -- Thai chili sauce, called sriracha. This is a sort of chili-garlic  \"catsup,\" fiery, flavorful and slightly sweet. Huy Fong Foods Inc., of  Rosemead, Calif., makes an excellent sriracha, packaged in a clear plastic  squeeze bottle with a drawing of a rooster on the front.    ~ -- Holy basil. Thai cooking uses many different types of basil, and this  type is intensely mint-flavored. Unless you grow it yourself, holy basil  can be difficult to find; fresh mint makes a good substitute.    ~ -- Thai \"bird\" peppers. These little hot peppers, usually green but  sometimes red, pack a notoriously powerful punch and are not for sissies.  Serrano peppers make a good substitute if Thai chilies are unavailable.    ~ -- CHILIES-IN-VINEGAR SAUCE (Makes about 1/2 cup); hot and sour  ingredient in soups and pad thai etc.        1/2    cup distilled white vinegar        1/2    tablespoon Thai fish sauce    12 small Thai chilies, or 3 serrano chilies, finely sliced    Combine all of the ingredients in a small serving bowl. Let stand for 30  minutes to allow the flavors to develop.    >Adapted from \"True Thai --- The Modern Art of Thai Cooking\" by Victor  Sodsook with Theresa Volpe Laursen and Byron Laursen (William Morrow and  Company Inc., New York, 1995).
