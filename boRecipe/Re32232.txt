  "Instructions": "SERVES 6-7      This is one ofthe great dishes of our culture. Yes, barbecued pork ribs  are very special, and they are ours. Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and  Houston seem to have the best ribs imaginable, though every major city in  America now boasts a few fine ribs houses.      Home cooking of ribs is not difficult at all.      There are several methods. I have heard of people steaming the ribs  before barbecuing in order to ensure tenderness . . . but I think there is  something heretical about that. Something to do with ones grandmother or  the Texas sky. Im not sure why that steaming suggestion so bothers me. It  might just work, but I am not about to waste a good slab of ribs trying to  find out.      I have smoked ribs in a garbage-can smoker and then finished them off in  the kitchen oven. I discussed that in an earlier book. That works well, but  anyone in Kansas City or Dallas would not hear of such a thing.      The old method seems to be the best. Cool fire, slow cooking, sauce on at  the end. That is what I want you to try.      At Arthur Bryants, in Kansas City, the meat is done over a very low fire  and offered with the sauce on the side. Their sauce is a bit unusual and I  have tried to come close to what they offer. My sauce follows. You must go  to Bryants sometime. Calvin Trillin loves the place and has made it quite  famous, although you will be surprised when you walk in. It is simply good  barbecue served in a black barbecue house. Paper plates, Formica tabletops,  the whole scene.      Salt and pepper the ribs and cook them over a low fire, just as in the  pork-shoulder recipe. They should take about 1-1/2 hours to cook. Be sure  that you do not put the ribs on top of one another. Give them plenty of  room. Control the smoke flavor by the use of the dampened wood chips or  sawdust.     Normally the sauce is put on after the ribs are cooked. However, if you  like crunchy ribs, baste the ribs when they are finished. Then continue to  cook for 15 more minutes. They wouldnt do that in Kansas City, and Edith  wouldnt do it in Chicago . . . but sometimes the crunchiness gained from  the darkened sugar in the sauce is just great.      Dont tell anyone in Kansas City that I told you to do this!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.",
