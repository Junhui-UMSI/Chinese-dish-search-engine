  "Instructions": "Just mix all this together.  It will keep 2 or 3 days in the refrigerator,  but it separates.  Sometimes we use this as a dressing on beef fajitas.  Subj:  PHULKA Date: 95-09-14 18:08:42 EDT From: Mrarchway    Subj:  Re:still looking for indian brea Date: 95-09-13 22:28:50 EDT From:  GeoBaker    PHULKA PUFFED WHOLE WHEAT BREAD    to make 5 six inch breads    1 cup flour 1/4 to 1/2 cup water    Place the flour in a deep bowl, make a well in the center and pour in 1/4  cup of the water. With your fingers or a spoon blend the water into the  flour. Then knead or beat the mixture together vigouously until it can be  gathered into a compact ball. If the dough crumbles add up to 1/4 cup more  water, 1 tbsp at a time until the particles adhere. On a lightly floured  surface, knead the dough by folding it end to end, then pressing it down  and pushing it forward several times with the heal of your hand. Repeat for  10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Again gather it into  a ball, place it in a bowl and drape a dampened kitchen towel over the top.  Set aside and let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes at room  temperature. To shape each phulka, devide the dough into 5 equal portions  and form each one into a ball. On al lightly floured surface, roll each  ball intop a round about 6 inches in diameter. As you proceed, cover the  phulkas with a damp kitchen towel. Heat an ungreased 10 to 12 inch skillet  with a nonstick finish or a  well seasoned cast iron skillet or griddle  until it is hot evough for a drop of water flicked into it to splutter  instantly. Place one of the phulkas in the pan and, moving it about  constantly with your fingers or the edge of a metal spatula, cook kit for a  minute or so, until the top begins to darken. Turn the phulka over and cook  for 1 minute longer, or until it is lightly browned. Then, holding a folded  linen kitchen towel in one hand, press it down gently but firmly on the  bread. Lift your hand away and the phulka should puff almost instantly.  Remove the towel and slide the phulka onto a heated plate. Serve the Phulka  warm as a mealtime bread If requested I have recipe for following Indian  breads: Alu paratha, Chapati, Dosa, Gobi Paratha, Naan, Paratha, Puri.
