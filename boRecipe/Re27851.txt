  "Instructions": "It is not known exactly when the Chinese first used woks. By examining  extant funerary stoves and stone relief pictures of the Han Dynasty  (200 B.C. to 220 A.D.), the author conjectures that they definitely  have been used for at least two thousand years. Since the Chinese wok  is a concave shaped cooking pan without seams or corners, it war  probably invented to fit directly over the round hole of the Chinese  cooking stove. Wood was used to fuel the cooking stove. When the wok  was put over the cooking hole, the rounded bottom of it would become  the hottest part of it, while the upper sides remained somewhat  cooler. To take advantage of this heating condition, the Chinese  \"chow\" or stir fry pieces of food that have been cut up into bite  size quickly in the wok. The high heat at the bottom of the wok seals  in the individual flavours of each ingredients. With a quick stir of  the wrist, all of the flavours of the ingredients are blended  together to form harmonious or contrasting tastes and textures.    Deep frying and steaming may also be performed in the wok. The wok is  actually an all purpose cooking utensil for the Chinese. Except for a  very good Chinese cleaver and a pot for cooking rice, that is all  that a Chinese really needs to prepare his meals.
