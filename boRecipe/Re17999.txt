  "Instructions": "The next few recipes are from a big, fat cookbook that would be  several volumes if they had not used the somewhat unappealing format  in which the recipes are presented.  The book is pretty no frills,  with little background given for the dishes.  Almost everything that  Ive tried from the book has been good, though.  Here we get into  some hard- core, no-fooling Chinese vegetarian recipes.  The book has  a lot of vegetarian stuff in it, as well as recipes tailored for  diabetics and those with ulcer problems.  Its actually pretty easy  to use once you get used to the odd format.    A. 1 tablespoon peanut oil B. 4 large mushrooms C. 1 cup finely  shredded bamboo shoots D. 2 teaspoons light soy sauce E. 1/2 teaspoon  sugar F. 1/2 teaspoon salt G. 1 tablespoon mushroom water H. 1 1/2  teaspoons cornstarch I. 1 teaspoon sugar J. 2 teaspoons light soy  sauce K. 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil L. 1/2 teaspoon salt M. 1  tablespoons mushroom water N. 4 pieces fresh bean curd skin O. 2 cups  peanut oil    PREPARATION:    I.  Wash B and soak in warm water for 15 minutes; drain and save  water; shred B very fine.    II.  Mix D,E,F,G.    III.  Mix H,I,J,K,L,M.    COOKING: 1. Heat A, add B, stir-fry a few seconds, add C, mix well.    2.  Add D-G, stir well and cook for 1 minute.    3.  Dip pastry brush into H-M and brush 1 piece of N generously.    4.  Spread 1/4 of A-G on top; place second piece of N over this; brush  again with H-M and spread 1/4 A-G over this.    5.  Repeat procedure until fourth layer is finished.    6.  Fold into a 2-to 3-inch roll; place on a plate and steam over  boiling water for 10 minutes; cool completely    7.  Heat O to 375F; deep fry A-N until golden brown (1 to 2 minutes),  cool. Slice and serve as hors doeuvres or serve with rice.    From \"An Encyclopedia of Chinese Food and Cooking\" by Wonona W. and  Irving B.  Chang, Helen W. and Austin H.  Kutscher.
