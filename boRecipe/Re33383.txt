  "Instructions": "James Beards Basic White Bread Makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves *  Making basic white bread dough * In a small bowl mix the yeast and the 1/4  cup warm water; add the sugar, stir well, and set aside until proofed. It  is proofed when fermentation is apparent: the mixture will swell and small  bubbles appear on the surface. (If it doesnt proof at all, it means the  yeast is not fresh.) In a small saucepan heat the milk with the salt and  stir in the butter until it melts. Set aside to cool until it is no warmer  than the yeast mixture. Put 2 cups of the flour in a large mixing bowl and  stir in the milk mixture. Beat well with a wooden spatula, add the yeast  mixture, and continue beating the dough until it is smooth, adding an  additional cup of flour to make a firm dough. Turn the dough out onto a  floured work surface and begin the kneading process, which evenly  distributes the fermenting yeast cells through the dough. * Kneading  Instructions * There are several kneading methods, but the basic one is to  flour the dough and your hand lightly, then push the heel of your hand down  into the dough and away from you. Fold the dough over, give it a quarter  turn, and push down again. Repeat pushing, folding and turning until the  motion becomes rhythmic. Knead for about 10 minutes, kneading in additional  flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky, and  blisters form on the surface. To test whether the dough has been kneaded  enough make an indention in it with your fingers; it should spring back. If  blisters form on the surface of the dough and break, this is another sign  that the kneading is sufficient. * Note: If you have a heavy-duty electric  mixer with a dough-hook attachment, knead the dough with the hook and  finish it off on the board. Butter a large bowl, transfer the dough to it,  and turn the bowl until the dough is well coated with butter on all sides.  Cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rise in a warm, draft-free  place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, until it is doubled in bulk. A good, warm,  draft-free place is inside your room temperature oven. To test further if  the dough has risen properly, make an indentation in it with two fingers:  if the dough does not spring back, then it is ready. * Baking Preparations  * Butter a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan, or two pans that are about 8x4x2 inches.  Punch the dough down with your fist to deflate it; transfer it to a floured  board and knead it well for about 3 minutes. Pat it into a smooth round or  oval shape and let it rest for 4 to 5 minutes. Then form into 1 large or  two small loaves, by shaping the dough into an oval the length of your  bread pan, then gently stretching, rounding, and plumping it in the palms  of your hands, tucking the edges underneath and pinching them together.  Lift carefully; drop the dough into the pan or pans and smooth out. Cover  the dough with a towel and let it rise again in a warm draft-free place for  about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until it is double in bulk. Preheat the oven to  400dF.  Brush the egg wash over the top of the dough. Bake in the center of  the oven for 20 minutes; reduce the heat to 350dF and bake for 20 to 25  minutes longer, until the crust is well browned and the bread sounds hollow  when removed from the pan and tapped on the bottom with the knuckles. If  you like a crusty loaf, remove it from the pan about 5 to 10 minutes before  the end of the baking time and let it finish baking on the oven rack. It  will get brown and crusty all over. Remove the bread from the oven and let  it cool on a rack before slicing. The bread may be stored in a plastic bag  in the refrigerator after it has cooled. If you seal it in a bag before it  is completely cooled, the crust will become soft. Stored bread will keep  about 1 week. It also freezes well if wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and  sealed in a plastic bag and can be kept for up to 3 months.",
