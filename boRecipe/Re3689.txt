  "Instructions": "Here is the outline for something I saw this morning on Geraldo (by  accident) that was done by Penn & Teller.  Its more of a macabre show-off  desert, but I laughed my ass off when I saw it.    Okay, start off by making some Jell-O, preferably strawberry or cherry or  some other flavor thats naturally red.  But, use two to three times as  much Jell-O mix as you normally would, to thicken up the consistency. After  this is mixed, stir in some cool whip, and pour it into your favorite  standard party mold (the dome kind would be good).    Get a CLEAN plastic bag (inside and out) and place in it some Karo syrup.  Now add something like a very dark red wine, or grape juice. What you want  is a semi-thick VERY dark red (opaque) liquid which looks not unlike blood.  Starting to get the picture yet?    Okay, now place this bag in the mold, so that the bag is still floating on  top.  Keep in mind that you want the Jell-O plus the bag to completely fill  the mold, but have a level surface, as this thing is going to flip over  later on.  Put it in the fridge, and allow it to chill and set.    When you take it out of the refrigerator, you should decorate it a little.  Try drizeling some chocolate glaze on top and poping a couple of  strawberries or cherries on top of this.  Allow to set if necessary, and  then bring it out to your dinner guests.    At this point, your dinner guests will probably be ooing and ahing over  this rather nice dessert youve brought out to them.  Make sure youve got  that big pointy butcher knife in one hand as you set this beauty down on  the table.    Now you get to play Norman Bates:  cut into the side of this, making sure  you go deep enough to cut into the bag real wide.  As you continue to cut  out a piece of the geltin mold, the bag will leak into this, and your  bewildered guests will think your dessert is _BLEEDING_. Not to disappoint  them, cut out one of these bloody pieces of geletin and plop it down on a  plate.  If youre lucky, it will look like a recently-extracted body organ.    Yes, this is gross.  Yes, I wouldnt bring this to the typical dinner  party.  Yes, I probably have a *very* warped sense of humor.  But, I  laughed quite loudly when I saw this being done by Penn & Teller.  At the  very least, it might be fun for a Halloween party... :-)    Newsgroups: rec.food.recipes Gregory L.
