  "Instructions": "Start with a thoroughly clean coffee maker. Wash after each use with hot,  soapy water and rinse well with hot water; never scour with an abrasive  pad. When cleaning an automatic coffee maker, follow the manufacturers  directions.    Always use fresh coffee and freshly drawn cold water. Never use hot water,  especially in automatic coffee makers; it changes percolating time.    Serve steaming-hot coffee as soon as possible after brewing. If coffee must  stand any length of time, remove grounds and hold coffee at serving  temperature over very low heat.    Keep ground coffee tightly covered.    PREPARATION METHODS Automatic: Follow manufacturers directions for  selecting grind of coffee (special ones are available), measuring and  brewing the coffee and holding the coffee at serving temperature.    Drip: Measure cold water and heat to boiling. Preheat coffeepot by rinsing  with very hot water. Measure drip-grind coffee into filter paper in cone or  into filter section of coffee-pot depending on the type of drip pot used.  Pour measured fresh boiling water into upper container; cover. When  dripping is completed, remove upper container and filter section.
