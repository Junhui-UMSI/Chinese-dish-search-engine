  "Instructions": "2. Put a little bit of peanut oil on a paper towel and rub it lightly over  the skillet. 3. The oiling process is done only once. 4. Put a pancake in  the pan. 5. After about 1 minute, turn the pancake over to cook on its  other side for about another minute. 6. Remove the pancake from the pan. 7.  Separate the two sides, and set them aside under a damp tea towel while you  cook the remaining pancakes. 8. At no time should the pancakes be allowed  to brown, although they may have lightly speckled brown spots on them. 9. A  sign that both pancakes are done is the appearance of air bubbles between  the pancakes and a general willingness for the two sides to separate from  each other. 10. The pancakes should be served immediately and hot. 11. If  they have cooled, put them into a steamer for a few minutes until they are  soft and hot. 12. They may also be wrapped tightly in foil and  refrigerated. 13. If they have been refrigerated, reheat them in a steamer  for 10 minutes. Makes 16 to 24 pancakes.    NOTES : The original recipe is over 15,000 words long and almost every  direction is dedicated to making the skin as crisp as possible.
