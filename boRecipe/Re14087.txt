  "Instructions": "2. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the  wire whip attachment, whip the cream until it just begins to mound. Set  aside in the refrigerator.    3. In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the wire  whip attachment, beat the eggs and the salt at medium-high speed until  frothy. Add the sugar in a steady stream and beat just until blended.  Remove the bowl from the mixer stand and place over a pot of hot water.  (The bottom of the bowl must touch the water.) Cook over medium-high heat,  whisking constantly for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the granules of sugar have  dissolved and the egg mixture has reached 140 degrees F on an instant-read  thermometer. Return the bowl to the mixer stand and beat at medium-high  speed until the mixture is thick and pale yellow, about 8 minutes.    4. Place the cold water in a small, heatproof cup. Sprinkle the gelatin  over the water and let it stand for 5 minutes to soften the gelatin.    5. Place the cup with the softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water  to come halfway up the side of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture over hot,  not simmering, water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 4 minutes, or  until the gelatin granules dissolve completely and the mixture is clear.  Remove the pan from the heat. Whisk the dissolved gelatin mixture into the  beaten egg mixture. Using a large rubber spatula, fold the cooled white  chocolate into the mixture. Fold one-third of the whipped cream into the  mixture to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whipped cream.    Assemble the veloutes:    1. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/2-inch round tip with some of  the veloute mixture. Pipe a circle of filling into the bottom of each mold,  on top of the cake round. Pipe more veloute to fill in the center of the  circle so that the entire cake round is covered with a level layer of  filling, approximately one-third up the side of the mold.    2. In each mold, place 6 to 7 raspberries in a circle on top of the  filling, leaving a 1/4-inch border of filling around the edge. Place 1  teaspoon of raspberry jam in the center of each raspberry circle.    3. Pipe more veloute filling into each mold, to fill completely. Using a  small metal cake spatula, scrape the top of each mold to make the filling  level with the top of the mold. Cover the molds with plastic wrap and  refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight, until set.    Make the warm chocolate curls:    1. waxed paper, then microwave on MEDIUM (50 percent) power for 10 second  intervals, until the chocolate starts to soften slightly. The chocolate  should soften slightly, not melt.    2. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Grip the chocolate chunk with a  folded paper towel so that your hand does not melt the chocolate. Using a  sharp vegetable peeler, scrape one of the edges of the chocolate chunk in a  downward motion, forming loose shavings. As you form the curls, let them  fall onto the waxed paper. Continue making curls until you have enough to  garnish just the tops of the veloutes.    Make the crumb garnish:    1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum  foil. Break the reserved sponge cake into small pieces and spread in an  even layer on the baking sheet. Bake 5 to 7 minutes, until the cake is dry  and lightly toasted. Allow the cake pieces to cool. Place the cake \"toast\"  in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade and process 30 to  45 seconds, or until fine crumbs are formed. Transfer the crumbs to a  medium bowl.    Make the raspberry sauce:    1. In a medium non-corrosive saucepan, combine the raspberries and sugar.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until  the sugar dissolves completely and the berries soften. Remove the pan from  the heat. Strain the raspberry mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a  bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the sauce.    Unmold and garnish the veloutes:    1. Remove the molds from the refrigerator and gently peel the tape off the  seams. Carefully remove the molds from the veloutes . Gently pat the cake  crumbs around the sides of each veloute, covering them evenly from the top  edge to the bottom. Top the veloutes with the white chocolate curls.
