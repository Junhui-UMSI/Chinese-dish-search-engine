  "Instructions": "Anyway, since Cairn mentioned the Dean & DeLuca Cookbook by David  Rosengarten, I thought Id offer these recipes from his book. Of these  sauces, weve only tried the SOUTH CAROLINA STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE so far,  and it was terrific. My Atlanta sister says its authentic.    The thicker barbecue sauces (Kansas City, Texas, western Carolina, South  Carolina) present multiple possibilities. You can slather them on pieces of  grilled or barbecued meat, or you can paint the meat with the sauces during  the last few minutes of cooking. At the table, you can pour the sauce in  tour plate and dip meat in it, or you can put your cooked meat on a  sandwich and slather that with sauce.    The eastern Carolina-style and the Kentucky- black barbecue sauces are  another story. They are quite different from what most of us call barbecue  sauce: thin and vinegary. Many Northerners wonder how to use them.    The procedure is simple. You take meat that has been cooked for a long time  and is falling apart (typically, pork in Carolina, lamb around Owensboro,  Kentucky), you pull the shreds apart, you moisten the meat with the  barbecue sauce in a bowl (shreds from a 4 to 5 pound bone-in hunk of meat  will need about 2 cups of sauce), and you serve the dressed meat shreds on  cheap, innocuous white rolls or on supermarket white bread.    Connoisseurs may add coleslaw and hot sauce.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by Roberta Banghart <bobbi744@acd.net> on Aug  15, 1998, ",
