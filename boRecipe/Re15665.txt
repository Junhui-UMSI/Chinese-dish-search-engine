  "Instructions": "Recipe by: DDMmom If a fruit jells easily, larger amounts of jelly can be  made at one time, especially if the jelly maker has experience. When  theres no one to show you the \"sheeting test\" to determine if the jell  point has been reached, theres a much more accurate way. Place candy  thermometer in boiling water, and note the temperature. For jelly, the  proper point has been reached when the temp is 8 degrees higher; for  preserves, its 9 degrees higher. The easiest and much more economical  method is to use commercial pectin. Its not as much fun, but in many cases  its the only way to get a jell. (Herb jellies unless you use an apple,  orange, or grape base, will not jell without commercial pectin.) If you use  sterilized jars and lids, processing isnt too important. However, in the  deep south with heat and humidity, the keeping qualities are greatly  improved using this method.  Topping with paraffin makes the use of unique  jars possible, but its not a reliable method for me.  It definitely works  in other areas of the country, and for short term storage I do use it- for  gift giving with the admonition to use in the near future included on the  card, for instance. I wish I could recommend a good book- there are bound  to be many, but mine are so old theyre out of print. Call your county  agent, and look in cartons of canning jars for booklet offers. And the  library.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip",
