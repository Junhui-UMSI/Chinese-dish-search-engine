  "Instructions": "Place the ball of dough between a folded sheet of polyethylene (wax paper  could probably be used in place of the plastic) on a tortilla press (a  little off center towards the hinge) and press hard. Remove the tortilla  from the press and peel off the plastic. If the dough has the correct  amount of water, the plastic will peel easily off the tortilla. If the  plastic sticks, the dough is too moist. If the tortilla cracks around the  edges, the dough is to dry. Place the tortilla on the hot, ungreased comal  and bake until the edges start to dry (about 30 seconds). Flip and bake  until lightly speckled on the underside (about 1 minute). Flip a second  time and bake for about 30 seconds more. As the tortillas come off the  comal, they should be wrapped together in a towel to keep them soft and  warm. The side thats up after the second flip is considered the  inside...where the filling would go if making tacos, flautas, enchiladas,  or whatever.    To be honest, fresh nixtamal and masa (as well as fresh tortillas) are so  easy to find in So. Calif. I dont have to go through all that hassle  (although, I do usually buy fresh nixtamal to grind into masa for making  tamales). But for those who arent so lucky, the above process should take  care of the situation. Good luck in your efforts...
