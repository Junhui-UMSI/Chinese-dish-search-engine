  "Instructions": "1. Use only the freshest ingredients, straight from the garden if possible.  Avoid produce with a waxed coating; it wont absorb brine.    2. Wash produce and cut off any bruised or discolored bits. Dirt and  spoilage that wouldnt be harmful when eaten fresh could breed dangerous  bacteria when seated in a jar.    3. Use salt without additives, such as kosher or pickling salt. Avoid sea  salt, which contains minerals, and iodized table salt.    4. Only white and cider vinegars have high enough acid levels for safe  pickling. If your pickles are too tart, dont decrease the vinegar-add more  sugar instead. Never boil the syrup beyond the time specified; prolonged  boiling breaks down acetic acid, making it too weak to prevent bacterial  growth.    5. Only jars specified for home canning are made to withstand the stresses  and high temperatures of the process. Use vintage canning jars only if they  are in perfect condition and can be used with new two-piece screw lids for  a secure fit. Use the flat lid only once. Screw bands can be reused if they  are rust-free and not bent.    6. Keep everything at its proper temperature. Pickles, jars, and lids  should be hot. Begin timing sterilizing of jars and water bath after the  water has come to a boil.    7. Leave pickles out to cool for twenty-four hours after processing. Before  storing them, check seals: The lids should be taut and sucked slightly  inward by the vacuum inside. Jars with loose seals should be refrigerated  and the pickles eaten within a week.    8. Date the pickles. \"Mine could sit in the cabinet for ten years,\" says  Salli LaGrone. \"I wouldnt want to serve them to company.\"    9. Store jars in a cool, dry, dark place. Moisture affects the seal; light  can bleach pickles.    10. Inspect each jar before opening it. Press down on the lid; if it gives  or \"clicks,\" the seal has broken and the pickles must be discard- ed. When  you open the jar, check for mold, leakage around the rim, gas or bubbling  inside, funny smells, and slimy pickles. If any of these are the case,  throw away the entire jar where children and pets will not find it.
