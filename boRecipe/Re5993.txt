  "Instructions": "You will need a large bread bowl, a rolling pin, and unglazed quarry tiles  or several baking sheets, or alternatively a castiron or other heavy  skillet or griddle at least 9 inches in diameter. Sprinkle the yeast over  the warm water in a large bread bowl. Stir to dissolve. Add whole wheat  flour, one cup at a time, then 1 cup white flour. Stir 100 times (one  minute) in the same direction to activate the gluten in the flour. Let this  sponge rest for at least 10 minutes or as long as 2 hours.    Sprinkle salt over the sponge and stir in the olive oil. Mix well. Add  white flour, one cup at a time. When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn  it out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes,  until dough is smooth and elastic. Return the dough to a lightly oiled  bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until at least double in  size, approximately 1 1/2 hours. Gently punch down. Dough can be made ahead  to this point and then stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 5 days or  less.    If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for baking  later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three times the  size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it just at the opening  of the bag. This will give the dough a chance to expand when it is in the  refrigerator (which it will do). From day to day, simply cut off the amount  of dough you need and keep the rest in the refrigerator, for up to one  week. The dough will smell slightly fermented after a few days, but this  simply improves the taste of the bread. Dough should be brought to room  temperature before baking.    This amount of dough will make approximately 16 pitas if rolled out into  circles approximately 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than 1/4-inch  thick. You can also of course make smaller breads. Size and shape all  depend on you, but for breads of this dimension the following baking tips  apply: Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking  sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one inch gap  all around to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide  dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while you work with the rest.  Divide dough into eight equal pieces and flatten each piece with lightly  floured hands. Roll out each piece to a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter.  You may wish to roll out all eight before starting to bake. Cover rolled  out breads, but do not stack. Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is  larger) directly on quarry tiles or baking sheets. Bake each bread for 3 or  4 minutes, until the bread has gone into a full \"balloon\" or until it is  starting to turn lightly golden, whichever happens first. If there are  seams or dry bits of dough - or for a variety of other reasons - your bread  may not go into a full \"balloon\". Dont worry, it will still taste great.  The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with all the  little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more consistently  \"balloon.\" But even then, if youre like us, it wont always \"balloon\"  fully and you wont mind because the taste will still be wonderful. When  baked, remove, place on a rack for about five minutes to let cool slightly,  then wrap breads in a large kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft).  When first half of the dough has been rolled out and baked, repeat for rest  of dough, or store in refrigerator for later use, as described above. You  can also divide the dough into more, smaller pieces if you wish, to give  you smaller breads. Yield  : 16 pitas about 8 inches in diameter, or more smaller breads.
