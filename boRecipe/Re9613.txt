  "Instructions": "Whisk together the pumpkin and the egg whites until blended.  Then add  flour and stir until the dough is thick enough to be turned out onto a  large cutting board or clean table top.  Douse with more flour, and  work/knead it into the dough.  When fully incorporated add more flour and  repeat.  Keep adding flour and kneading until the dough can hold its own  shape.  It will still be a little bit sticky.    At this stage, I chilled the dough overnight, but I have no idea if doing  so was essential to the success of my gnocchi--I was just starting to feel  really guilty about those essays I hadnt yet graded.    When youre ready to eat the gnocchi, get a pot of boiling water going on  the stove.  Generously flour your board or tabletop and hands.  Cut the  dough into fourths and roll each fourth into a cylinder, and slice off  gnocchi-sized chunks.  I have to be vague about measurements because I was  having a hard time with my cylinder rolling technique and at one point just  hacked the cylinder in two lengthwise to speed things along. I aimed for  1/2-inch chunks, but some were bigger than that.  Drop into salted boiling  water.  As they rise to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon,  shake off excess water, and put them on a serving plate.    Having once watched Martha Stewart shape gnocchi on TV, I tried to emulate  her technique of pressing them gently against the tines of a form before  dropping them in the water for about half of my gnocchi.  They turned out  just as ugly as the ones I more carelessly dropped in the water without  shaping.  YM(and skill)MV.    The recipe provided me with two substantial dinners for myself, once I  topped the gnocchi with some leftover TVP chili.
