  "Instructions": "To salt cure ripe olives:  Use small unbruised black or purplish-black  olives.  Cover bottom of clean slatted wooden box (such as a fruit lug or a  flat rectangular basket with a double layer of cheesecloth. Rinse olives in  cold water and put a layer on bottom of box. Cover damp olives with a layer  of uniodized or pickling salt. (For each pound of olives, youll need at  least a pound of salt for the monthlong process.) Repeat layering olives  and salt, then cover the entire batch with a final layer of salt and  another piece of cloth. Set box into a tray or cardboard box so that the  liquid that seeps out will not stain the countertop or floor; store in cool  basement or garge and let stand one week. After a week, uncover and  transfer olives and salt to another container. Re-layer olives with  additional salt in the same cloth-lined box for about three to four days.  Repeat layering and salting olives every four days for one month, using new  salt each time, until olives are wrinkled and lose enough bitterness to be  edible.  (If any mold appears on the olives, rinse mold off with cold water  and soak olives in bowl of distilled white vinegar for one hour, then  return to salt. Otherwise, there is no need to rinse the olives in water  before returning them to the salt cure.) In batches, remove cured olives  from salt; place them in a large strainer or a colander. Dip strainer or  colander into saucepan of boiling water for a few seconds. Drain blanched  olives and rinse with cold tap water. (Repeat this step with remaining  olives, changing boiling water whenever it gets too salty-after about every  12th dip.) Spread olives out on paper towels to dry for a few hours or  overnight.  Place olives in jars and cover with olive oil. If desired, mix  in herbs, hot peppers, garlic, vinegar, or grated orange or lemon rind.  Store sealed jars in the refrigerator.  The olives will keep for at least  one month.  Dry-cured olives may also stored in new salt in airtight  containers for up to six months in the refrigerator. Before using  salt-stored olives, rinse and dry the fruits.    To brine cure green or ripe olives:  Use mature fully colored green or  dark-red to purplish-black olives. The ripe olives may fade in color during  curing but they will darken again when exposed to air. With small knife,  slash each olive to its pit three times. Rinse in water. Place rinsed and  drained olives in one-quart glass jars, filling them 3/4 full. Cover the  olives with a brine containing 3/4 cup uniodized or pickling salt dissolved  in a gallon of water. Insert a small, sealed food-storage bag filled with  1/4 cup water into each jar to keep olives immersed in brine. Screw on the  lid loosely and refrigerate. After one week, replace the brine with a  mixture of 1 2/3 cups salt per gallon of water. After 15 days replace the  brine with another mixture of 1 2/3 cups salt per gallon of water. Replace  the brine at 1-month intervals for additional two to three months. If you  keep the olives airtight in brine, you can store them for at least one  year.  You can eat these olives within two months if you like fairly-bitter  olives. Use them for cooking or season them for appetizers. To rduce their  saltiness, soak the olives in fresh water three days. Store any uneaten  desalted olives in the refrigerator in a solution of one part red or white  wine vinegar to two parts water and float a layer of olive oil on top to  preserve them.    ",
