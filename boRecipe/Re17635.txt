  "Instructions": "minutes before serving, transfer cake to serving platter and garnish with  strawberries. Use knife to cut cake into wedges and serve immediately.    For individual dessert shells: Use back of a spoon to carefully spread  about 1/2 cup of meringue inside each traced circle. Still using spoon,  form an indentation in center and a decorative edge around side of each  shell.    Serves 8 to 10.    Cooks Illustrated, May/June 1995, Page 13. Credit: Jack Bishop.    Nationality: USA Course: dessert Season:any Method: baked    Start to Finish a day Preparation 20 minutes Attention a day Finishing 15  minutes    Converted from Mangia!, Cooks Illustrated 1993-1995 Cookbook    NOTES : If you have any meringue left after piping the two disks, make a  few dessert shells.  To soften the ice cream, place it in the refrigerator  about thirty minutes before needed.  And remember,not all of the ice cream  is needed at the same time.  If you need ice cream softened in a hurry, you  can also microwave it on the defrost setting, checking it every thirty  seconds at first, and then every fifteen seconds as it reaches the softened  state.
