  "Instructions": "from the book Chocolate Truffles by Carrie Huber.    Making the Ganache: To prepare ganache, chop or grate chocolate into small  pieces. Place in top half of double boiler along with cream. Put hot (not  boiling) water in bottom half of a double boiler, making sure the water  doesnt touch the top pan. Stir often with wooden spoon. When all of the  chocolate has melted, beat until well combined. Remove from heat, let cool  to room temperature. Transfer to covered bowl and refrigerate overnight to  harden. (Ganache will keep in this state for a few days if necessary.)    Take a little ganache at a time and form 1\" balls, using fingertips (with  as little contact as possible so the chocolate doesnt soften). Keep unused  portion refrigerated as you work. Place balls on waxed paper-lined baking  sheet; continue until ganache is used up. Refrigerate baking sheet until  ganache is hardened, overnight or up to two days. Allow to set in  refrigerator at least two hours before loosely covering with waxed paper.  Foil can be substituted in all cases for waxed paper, but never use clear  plastic wrap. It clings too tightly to the candies and traps moisture  inside which discolors the chocolate. Prepare Chocolate Coating: Chop or  grate chocolate into small pieces. Heat chocolate and oil together in top  of double boiler over hot water, stirring until smooth with a wooden spoon.  Insert candy thermometer and begin dipping the ganache balls when  temperature registers between 85-90F. If chocolate begins to cool and  thicken before youre finished dipping, reheat over hot water. Work with  only 1/2 dozen at a time, keeping the rest refrigerated. Drop a single  ganache ball into the chocolate, turning to coat well, then lift it with  the fork. Allow excess chocolate to drip back into pan, then gently rap  fork against edge of pan to remove more chocolate from ball. Failure to do  this will cause a large dribbly \"platform\" or \"skirt\" to form around the  base of each hardened truffle. (this makes it difficult to pack them side  by side in a box.)    There are two schools of thoughts as to the proper method of depositing  truffles onto the baking sheet: A) If you are conservative by nature its  best to gently slide them off the fork with a butterknife, onto the waiting  baking sheet. B) If you intend to further decorate the truffle, the second  method, (for the show-offs among us) involves dropping the truffle off the  fork upside down directly onto the baking sheet. Quickly manipulate the  single strand of chocolate, adhering to the fork, into some glorious shape  atop the candy, like the pros do. Either way is acceptable, although the  second way requires some practice and an accurate thermometer to get it  right. If your chocolate temperature is off by a few degrees, youre likely  to find a chocolate highway - not a chocolate strand - adhering to the fork  when that critical moment comes.    The perfect finale for the basic recipes, for instance, is a sprinkling of  shaved dark chocolate over the top, or better yet, gently rolling each  newly-dipped truffle in the shavings to coat completely.    Refrigerate all truffles after dipping several hours or overnight to  harden.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #463 by Shelley Sparks  <ssparks@mailbox.arn.net> on Dec 20, 1997",
