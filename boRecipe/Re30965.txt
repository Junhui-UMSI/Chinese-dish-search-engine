  "Instructions": "Awhile back I mentioned that I thought that it odd that nobody eats  tarantulas because of their close relationship to crabs and the  like--favorite foods in many cuisines. Last night I was watching a show on  a tribe of Amazonian Indians and lo and behold, they were trapping and  cooking the big ol spiders. And I do mean big. These guys were the size of  blue crabs. I would guess that theyre at least eight inches across the  spread legs.    \"Take one tarantula...\" Not an easy process! First they catch the critters  by luring them out of their tunnels with a long strip of grass. The hunter  then very deftly grabs the spider by the thorax, folds the legs back and  wraps the spider in a leaf for transportation to the camp site.    At the campsite, the spiders are killed. Everything is used. The abdomens  are removed and stripped of eggs. The eggs are wrapped in a leaf and  roasted over a fire to produce a spider egg omelette. The bodies are tossed  directly onto a fire to singe off the hair and to cook the meat. When  theyre done, the legs and thorax are cracked open and picked just like  when you eat a crab. After the meal the fangs--which are a good inch and a  half long-- are used as toothpicks. It was emphasized that the spiders  taste *very* much like crab.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg    ",
