  "Instructions": "1. THE GARLIC AND THE CHILES. Set a heavy ungreased skillet or griddle over  medium heat. Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast to  a sweet mellowness, turning occasionally, until soft when pressed between  your fingers (youll notice it has blackened in a few small spots), about  15 minutes. cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop.    While the garlic is roasting, break the stems off the chiles, tear the  chiles open and shake nd/or pick out all the seeds; for themildest sauce,  be careful to remove all the stringy, light-colored veins. Next toast the  chiles (to give them a richer flavor) a few at a time on your mediium-hot  skillet or griddle; Open them flat, lay them on the hot surface skin-side  up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if the temperature  is right youll hear a faint crackle), then flip them. (If you pressed them  just long enought, theyll have changed to a mottled tan underneath. If you  see a slight wisp of smoke, its okay, but any more than that will mean  burnt chiles and bitter taste) Now, press down again to toast the other  side (you wont notice as much change in color on the skin side). Transfer  the toasted chiles to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30  minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. pour off the water,  reserving about 2/3 cup.    2. THE PUREE. If youre using whole spices, pulverize the oregano with the  pepper and cumin in a mortar or spice grinder, then transfer the ground  spices to a food processor or blender, along with the drained chiles, the  garlic and the reserved soaking liquid. Process to a medium-smooth, thick  puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds. (If youre using a blender  and the mixture wont move through the blades, add water a little at a time  until everything is moving, but still as thick as possible. Not only is a  soupy misture a watery, uninteresting marinade, but the pureeing  capabilities of the blender are much reduced when too much liquid is  added.) Taste and season with salt    ADVANCE PREPARATION - Covered and refrigerated, the seasoning will keep for  a week or more, it can be successfully frozen.    OTHER CHILES YOU CAN USE - While this recipe looks similar to that for  ancho, the fact that it used the soaking liquid and more garlic gives it a  balance just right for pasilla. Mulato could work here, though it doesnt  have the roundness of pasilla. As with Ancho Chile Seasoning Paste, you can  embroider pasill with a chipotle for a smoky edge.    TRADITIONAL DISHES THAT USE THIS ESSENTIAL AS A STARTING POINT - Spicy  Pasilla-Mushroom Tacos, Layered Pasilla-Tortilla Casserole, Seared Lamb in  Swarthy Pasilla-Honey Sauce    NOTES : Pasilla is one of the most sophisticated chile flavors; pungent and  tangy, deeply rich and woodsy.  When youre used to using the gentler Ancho  Seasoning Paste, graduate to pasilla.  The techniques for making it are the  same as those ou encounter with the ancho seasoning. Here, we accentuate  and balance their muscley, less-sweet flavor by using their soaking water,  adding more garlic and elaborating their woodsiness with mroe herbs, fewer  spices. The near black pasilla tastes perfect with plack beans, mushrooms  and richer meats like lamb and duck.  Its spicy pungency becomes more  focused when dark sugar or honey are part of the finished dish. If you  enjoy reich, bold flavors, youll love dishes made from pasilla.
