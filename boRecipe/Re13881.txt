  "Instructions": "This stays very shiny and is easy to cut through.  These decorations will not dry hard as Wilton  color-flow & must be done directly on the cake or  cookie.  CAUTION - Marshmallow cream will be VERY HOT.  TO PREPARE MARSHMALLOW CREAM -  Pan Method: Place about 1 1/2\" water in a large  skillet or electric pan.  Depending upon design,  set  up to four jars of marshmallow cream (one for each  color) into pan and bring water to a boil.  For faster  heating, fill jars only halfway.  Add icing color as  the cream softens, stir until color is well blended.  Let simmer, then stir until cream is smooth.  Leave  jars in water while you decorate. Microwave Method:  Place the desired amount of marshmallow cream in a  bowl.  Add desired past color.  Microwave on high  power for about 10 to 12 seconds, then stir.  If not  softened (the total time depends on quantity being  heated) microwave again for 7 to 8 seconds more.  After heating, stir until color is completely blended.  TO DECORATE:  Trace pattern on cake with a toothpick.  Outline design with stiffened buttercream or royal  icing (royal is preferred as the heat of the  marshmallow cream may soften buttercream) and tip 3.  Let outlines dry for 10 minutes or more.  Cut a very  small opening in the end of a parchment bag and fill  with marshmallow cream.  \"Flow-in\" by filling in along  the edges of the outline first, squeezing gently and  letting the icing flow up to the outline almost by  itself.  Work quickly; filling in design from the  outside edges in and from top to bottom.  If youre  working with a large area, have 2 parchment bags ready  so it wont set up before youre done.  If the  marshmallow starts cooling and wont flow smoothly,  simply microwave bags for about 7 to 8 seconds on high  power.  Any remaining cream can be stored in a jar &  reused by microwaving for 8-9 seconds until soft.    ",
