  "Instructions": "Tamale Making From \"The Cuisines of Mexico\", By Diana Kennedy ISBN  0-06-012344-3.    This is the definitive book on authentic Mexican cooking. I highly  recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to cook Mexican food as it is  prepared in Mexico.    Notes on Making Tamales    1. The corn husks. It is usual for corn husks bought here to be trimmed and  flattened ready for use. But if by chance you have some in their rough  state, just as they were when removed from the ear, cut off the cupped part  at the bottom of the leaf and trim off the pointed tip. When you get them  the husks will be dried out and papery. To soften them ready for use, pour  plenty of very hot water over them and leave them to soak for several  hours. Shake them well to get rid of excess water and pat them dry with a  towel.    2. Making the tamales. Smear a thin coating of the tamal dough over the  broadest part of the husk, allowing for turning down about 1 1/2 inches at  the bottom broad part of the leaf and about 3 inches at the pointed top.  Let us say, for a good-sized tamal spread the dough over an area  approximately 3 inches wide and 3 1/2 inches long.     Spread the filling down the middle of the dough. Fold the sides of the  husk together firmly. Turn up the pointed end of the leaf and fold the  broader end over it. Tear some of the husks lengthwise into narrow strips,  and use one for tying each tamal across the top flap. The husks are water  repellent, and since the dough is to be steamed, the idea is to form a  water-tight package so that when the dough is cooked through it will be  light and spongy. If moisture gets in it will be soggy.    3. Cooking the tamales. The most convenient way to cook tamales is a  conventional steamer. You can, of course improvise, but improvisations are  not usually as efficient--a lot of good steam escapes and the cooking is  not as even.     Fill the bottom of the steamer with water up to the level indicated and  bring to a boil. Line the top of the steamer with corn husks, covering the  bottom and sides well. Stack the tamales upright, with the tied-down flaps  upwards. For the best results, they should be packed firmly but not too  tightly, because the husks swell out as the dough cooks. (I always find  that a small batch of tamales, not firmly packed in the steamer, do not  cook as well or as quickly and are more likely to absorb the condensed  steam.) Cover the tamales with more corn husks. Cover the top of the  steamer with a thick cloth--a piece of old toweling is best--to absorb the  condensation from the lid of the steamer. Cover the steamer with a tightly  fitting lid.     As the water in the bottom part comes to a boil, put a coin into it, put  the top part of the steamer on, and let the tamales cook for about 2 1/2 to  3 hours over a medium flame. Keep the water bubbling, but not boiling  violently. That is the reason for the coin. You will be able to hear it  dancing about, and it will tell you if the water goes off the boil or is  getting dangerously low. If the water is allowed to go off the boil the  tamales will be heavy. Keep a kettle of water simmering so that you can  refill the steamer when necessary.     To test the tamales for doneness, remove one from the center, and one from  the side of the steamer. As you open the husks, the dough should come away  easily from the husks and be completely smooth. To make doubly sure, open  up the tamales and see if they are spongy and well cooked throughout.    4. Serving and storing the tamales. Once cooked, tamales are very good  tempered. They are wonderful eaten right away, straight out of the husks,  but after they cool off they are also extremely good heated through very  gently in their husks in an ungreased heavy frying pan, or on a griddle.  Just keep turning them so that they heat through evenly and the husk gets  slightly browned but does not burn. They can be refrigerated, and will keep  well stored that way for about a week. It is best, however, to freeze them.  To reheat, they can be wrapped in foil, put into a 350 degree oven still  frozen, and heated through for about 30 minutes.
