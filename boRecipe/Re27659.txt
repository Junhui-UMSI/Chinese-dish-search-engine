  "Instructions": "First let me say that this is not my recipe. It was created by Jim  Tarantino as a method of adding some red color to another of his unusual  and exciting sauces, Yellow Hell Marinade, which is used in a dish he  created called \"Mango Shrimp from Hell.\" I made the Dreaded Red Menace some  evenings ago and absolutely fell in love with it. I think its a  masterpiece of creativity and simplicity. My dinner companion, a young lady  relatively inexperienced in the ways of cooking and spicy foods, felt that  the Dreaded Red Menace was a little much. You be the judge, but definitely  try it!  Theres a variation on this sauce called the \"Smoky Red Menace\"  and it uses 3 - 4  dried chipotles instead of the habaneros. Heres what  Jim Tarantino says about this sauce:    \"For Philadelphias Book and the Cook event, I wanted to streak some red  sauce paint through pools of Yellow Hell marinade for a dish called Mango  Shrimp from Hell. Well, the red sauce never made it to the shrimp ~ it  tasted so good that we marinated chicken breasts with it instead. People  are initially fooled by the sweet raspberry flavor, but this marinade packs  a fair amount of heat. We started referring to the marinade in the  restaurant as the \"Dreaded Red Menace.\" Its wonderful as a dipping sauce  too.\"    One of the reasons I made this sauce when I did was because, in the  directions for the recipe, Tarantino mentions that one should use the  plastic, or dough, blade in the Cuisinart when pureeing the raspberries. I  wanted to see just how true his comment was, since there was some  discussion of the issue on CIS. I pureed the berries in two batches, one  with the steel blade and the other with the plastic blade. Jim Tarantino  clearly speaks from experience. Use the plastic blade for raspberries and  other similar berries.    Combine the chiles, orange zest, and vinegar in a heavy nonreactive pot and  bring to a boil. Reduce the vinegar to 1/3 cup, strain, and discard the  solids. Return the vinegar to the saucepan. Puree the raspberries in a food  processor fitted with a plastic dough blade. (A steel blade will crush the  seeds, which will lend a bitter taste to the food.) Then strain. Add the  raspberry puree to the vinegar and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.  Cool to room temperature and add the orange juice. The marinade will keep  in the refrigerator in an airtight jar for 1 to 2 weeks.    Yield: 1 1/2 cups    Marinate shrimp for 2 to 3 hours; chicken breasts 4 to 6 hours.    From the book \"Marinades\" by Jim Tarantino    ",
