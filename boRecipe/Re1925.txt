  "Instructions": "sharp fork or skewer, put them into the pressure cooker with water to  cover, and cook at low pressure for about 15 munutes - they should be soft  but not mushy. (If you are not using a pressure cooker, cook over fairly  low heat, tightly covered, for 30 to 40 minutes.)    Drain the chiles, remove the stems, and wipe off any stray seeds clinging  to the outside.    Set aside.    Meanwhile, cover the ancho chiles with hot water and simmer for 5 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a blender. Add 1 cup of the water, the garlic, herbs,  seeds, and bay leaf plus 4 of the cooked chipotles and blend until almost  smooth.    Heat the oil in a shallow pan, add the blended ingredients, and fry for  about 3 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. Add  the vindgars, the rest of the water, the sugar, and the salt and cook for 5  minutes more. Then add the rest of the cooked chiles and cook over low  heat, scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time to prevent sticking,  until the sauce has reduced and thickened - about 15 minutes.    Store in the refrigerator or sterilize and store in a cool place.    Makes about 3 cups.    NOTE: If you prefer a less pungent version of this recipe, cook the chiles  first for about 5 minutes. Drain, slit them open, and remove the seeds and  what remains of the veins. Discard the water and start at the beginning of  the recipe, reducing the cooking time by about 5 minutes. If you wish to  have a lighter sauce, add another 6 ounces of tomatoes to the adobo.
