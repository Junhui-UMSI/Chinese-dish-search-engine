  "Instructions": "Text:     Mr. and Mrs. Robbins were taking a motor trip last year through  the South.  At one of the Southern hotels they were served a salad dressing  which more than delighted their tastes.  Asking if they might have the  recipe, they were told to leave their name and their address and it would  be mailed to them. On their return, they found the recipe with a bill for  $200.00.  Aghast, they consulted their lawyer and were told that inasmuch  as they had ordered with- out asking the price, they would have to pay.  Feeling that so costly a recipe should be shared with many, Mrs. Robbins  had copies made and sent to her friends. Try it and we think youll smack  your lips.    2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons dry mustard 2 teaspoons paprika 2 teaspoons  celery seed or ground celery seed 3/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup vinegar 2 cups  Mazola oil 2 tablespoons grated onions    Put together in the top of a double boiler and stir well. Then place the  boiler in a bowl of quite warm water. Stirring and feeling with the finger  to see that it gets to less than blood warmth just off the cold. Then  remove double boiler and beat with a rotary egg beater until thick. Put  into a bottle.  Keep in refrigerator and shake well before using. Do not  let mixture get too warm. It will not thicken if you do.
