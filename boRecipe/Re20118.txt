  "Instructions": "VANILLA (Vanilla planifolia); is native to Central America and Mexica.  Mexica monopolized the profitable Vanilla trade for three centuries. It is  now produced mainly in the Malagasy Republic (Madagascar) and neighboring  islands of Reunion and Comores. Lesser amounts come from Java, Tahiti, and  Mexico. Long before Columbus discovered America, the Aztecs enjoyed a drink  call \"Xoco-Latl\" made from cocoa and vanilla beans. This was discovered by  Cortez, and Vanilla was taken back to Spain from where its use soon spread  to other parts of Europe. Vanilla is the fruit of an orchid plant; each  hand-pollinated flower becomes a long slender pod or bean which is picked  while still green. It undergoes a curing and drying process during which  aroma and flavor are developed. Pure Vanilla Extract, a delicate, subtle  flavoring, is a complex mixture of natural ingredients, many of which are  unknown. Imitation vanilla extract is a mixture of color and synthetic  flavors, mainly vanillin. Pure vanilla has a pleasant \"bouquet\" and a full,  well-rounded flavor that is not present in an imitation vanilla extract.  For the protection of consumers, Federal standards have now been issued to  define the name Vanilla Extract and provide that no imitation flavors may  be used in making pure Vanilla Extract. USES...Use Vanilla to flavor most  sweet foods such as eggnog, milk shakes, hot chocolate and other milk  beverages; ice cream; rice, bread and other puddings; cakes; cookies;  dessert or fruit sauces; custards; stewed fruits, fruit compotes; candies;  glazes; frostings; whipped cream; pies; coffee; tortes; meringue shells;  cheesecake; dessert souffles; sundae toppings; cream puff and pastry  fillings; muffins; coffee cakes and cream cheese filling for fruit bread.
