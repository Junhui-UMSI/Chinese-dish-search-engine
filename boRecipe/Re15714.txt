  "Instructions": "Remember that it is the total carbohydrate in a food that counts. All  carbohydrates -- starches and sugars -- are eventually changed into blood  glucose. Diabetics can eat sugar as long as it is counted as part of the  total carbohydrate intake for the day. The goal though is to eat  healthfully and to not waste your carbohydrates on foods that do not offer  much in the way of nutrition (like most high sugar foods). The key with  sugar is moderation! Also, remember that sugar free does not mean  carbohydrate free. If you do consume foods with artificial sweeteners, be  sure to check the total carbohydrate count in the food. Do not assume that  it is a good food to eat just because it is sugar free. All of the recipes  that we post on this site try to be low-fat, high-fiber and nutritious.  Because of possible health risks, you will not see recipes with artificial  sweeteners here. We post dessert recipes that, while they may contain some  source of sugar (honey, sugar, fruit juice etc.), ! ! ! are relatively low  in sugar for a dessert recipe. Again, use common sense and moderation when  figuring any food with sugar into your diet.
