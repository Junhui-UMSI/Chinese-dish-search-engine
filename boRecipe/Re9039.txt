  "Instructions": "Before you start preparing this recipe you need to know that it will create  a considerable amount of smoke in your house during the early stages of  preparation.  Preheat your oven to 500oF and verify with an oven  thermometer that your temperature is correct. While oven is preheating let  your prime rib stand at room temperature for at least 1-1/2 hours, longer  if possible to allow the inside of the roast to warm up as this will effect  the cooking by this technique. Place the roast in a baking pan on a flat  rack.  Place roast in the preheated 500oF oven for 5 minutes per pound.  ONCE YOU HAVE PLACED THE ROAST IN THE OVEN YOU MUST, MUST, MUST LEAVE THE  OVEN DOOR CLOSED. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR FOR ANYTHING. After cooking for  5 minutes per pound, turn off the oven. Continue to leave the OVEN DOOR  CLOSED.  Let the roast set in the hot oven for 2 hours, with the DOOR  CLOSED. The roast is ready to carve when it comes out of the oven since the  juices have been reabsorbed while the roast has been setting in the oven.  Carve and serve. Bon a Petite.
