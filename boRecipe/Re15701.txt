  "Instructions": "FENUGREEK: These small, yellow-brown seeds have a slight bitter flavor  which, when added in small quantities, is very good in curries, chutneys  and pickles, soups, fish and shellfish dishes.    GINGER: Available in many forms. Invaluable for adding to many savory and  sweet dishes and for baking gingerbread and brandy snaps. Fresh ginger root  looks like a knobby stem. It should be peeled and finely chopped or sliced  before use. Dreid ginger root is very hard and light beige in color. To  release flavor, \"bruise\" with a spoon or soak in hot water before using.  This dried type is more often used in pickling, jam making and preserving.  Also available in ground form, preserved stem ginger and crystallized  ginger.    MACE & NUTMEG: Both are found on the same plant. The nutmeg is the inner  kernel of the fruit. When ripe, the fruit splits open to reveal bright red  arils which lie around the shell of the nutmeg - and once dried are known  as mace blades. The flavor of both spices is very similar - warm, sweet and  aromatic, although nutmeg is more delicate than mace. Both spices are also  sold ground. Use with vegetables; sprinkled over egg dishes, milk puddings  and custards; eggnogs and mulled drinks; or use as a flavoring in desserts.    PAPRIKA: Comes from a variety of pepper (capsicum) and although similar in  color to cayenne, this bright red powder has a mild flavor.    PEPPER: White pepper comes from ripened berries with the outer husks  removed. Black pepper comes from unripened berries dried until dark  greenish-black in color. Black pepper is more subtle than white. Use white  or black peppercorns in marinades and pickling, or freshly ground as a  seasoning. Both are available ground. Green peppercorns are also unripe  berries with a mild, light flavor. They are canned in brine or pickled, or  freeze-dried in jars. They add a pleasant, light peppery flavor to sauces,  pates and salad dressings. Drain those packed in liquid and use either  whole or mash them lightly before using. Dry green peppercorns should be  lightly crushed before using to help release flavor, unless otherwise  stated in a recipe.    POPPY SEEDS: These tiny, slate-blue seeds add a nutty flavor to both sweet  and savory dishes. Sprinkle over desserts and breads.    SAFFRON: This pice comes from the stigmas of a species of crocus. It has a  distinctive flavor and gives a rich yellow coloring to dishes, however, it  is also the most expensive spice to buy. Available in small packets or jars  (either powdered or in strands - the strands being far superior in flavor).  This spice is a must for an authentic paella or Cornish Saffron Cake. Also  an extremely good flavoring for soups, fish and chicken dishes.    SESAME SEEDS: High in protein and mineral oil content, sesame seeds have a  crisp texture and sweet, nutty flavor which combines well in curries and  with chicken, pork and fish dishes. Use also to sprinkle over breads,  cookies and pastries before baking.    STAR ANISE: This dried, star-shaped seed head has a pungent, aromatic  smell, rather similar to fennel. Use very sparingly in stir-fry dishes.  Also good with fish and poultry.    TURMERIC: Closely related to ginger, it is an aromatic root which is dried  and ground to produce a bright, orange-yellow powder. It has a rich, warm,  distinctive smell, a delicate, aromatic flavor and helps give dishes an  attractive yellow coloring. Use in curries, fish and shellfish dishes, rice  pilafs and lentil mixtures. It is also a necessary ingredient in mustard  pickles and piccalilli.    All spices should be stored in small airtight jars in a cool, dark place,  as heat, moisture and sunlight reduce their flavor.    ",
