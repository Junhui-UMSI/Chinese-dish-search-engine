  "Instructions": "Waffles are as American as apple pie, and like apple pie are an import. The  word \"waffle\" and probably the food, comes to us from the Dutch \"wafel\",  but the French eat them too, calling them \"gaufre\" from the Old French  \"wafla\".  Whatever their provenance, waffles have been eaten by Americans  since Pilgrim times.    Europeans eat their waffles as a sweet course, topping them with powdered  sugar, whipped cream, or honey or stuffing them with icing. Americans have  occasionally served waffles for dessert - perhaps a chocolate waffle with  ice cream - but in general we eat them for breakfast with all-American  maple syrup.  At least NOW we do, if we eat waffles at all.    But in the Thirties, and before that, Americans ate waffles with virtually  anything that could be spooned or poured over their bumpy, golden tops. And  we ate them for breakfast, for luncheon, and for supper. If we served them  to guests at a Sunday Night Supper, it became a waffle supper, \"sure to be  a party guests remember,\" according to the General Foods cookbook \"All  About Home Baking\" (1933).    And we made waffles with just about everything:  Cheese waffles; cornmeal  waffles; coconut, pineapple, and chocolate waffles; gingerbread waffles;  banana waffles; cheese and tomato, date, and peanut butter waffles; apple  waffles; oatmeal waffles; and prune, bran, apricot, and even pea pulp  waffles (which Pictorial Review featured as one of their best recipes for  1927.)
