  "Instructions": "Combine the yeast and the warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork  to dissolve the yeast. Let stand for 3 minutes. Combine the flours and salt  in a large bowl. Pour the cool water and the yeast mixture over the flour,  and mix with your fingers to form a shaggy mass. Move the dough to a  lightly floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes. It should be supple  and resilient, but not too smooth at this point. Let the dough rest on the  work surface for 20 minutes, covered with plastic wrap or a light towel.  (This rest period is the autolyse.) Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes.  Dont overknead it: The dough should be smooth, stretchy, and resilient.  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn it in the bowl to coat with  oil, and cover it with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature ( 75 to  77 degrees F) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in volume.  Gently deflate the dough and fold it over itself in the bowl. Reshape it  into a ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1 1/4 hours or  until it has nearly doubled again. Gently deflate the dough again, reshape  into a round, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour. Place the dough on a  very lightly floured surface and divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 10  ounces each). Gently stretch one piece into a rectangle, leaving some large  bubbles in the dough. Fold the top third down and the bottom third up as if  you were folding a business letter. Now form the loaf into a log by rolling  the dough over from left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of  your palm. Fold the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the  length of the loaf, then repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight  over the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the  dough. Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or  deflate its airy structure. Set aside on the work surface to relax efore  elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with remaining pieces of  dough. Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped,  by rolling it back and forth on the work surface. Begin with both hands  over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the loaf  reaches the desired length. (Dont get carried away, or the baguettes wont  fit in your oven!) Place the finished loaves on a peel or upside down  baking sheet lined with parchment paper and generously sprinkled with  cornmeal or on a baguette pan. Cover the loaves with well oiled plastic or  a floured cloth and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes until the loaves are  slightly plump but still not doubled in volume. The final rise is short,  because you want the baguettes to be slightly underproofed; this will give  them a better oven spring, resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and  more flared cuts. Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500  degrees F. Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty  water pan directly under the stone. Use a very sharp razor blade or lame to  make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on the top of  each baguette. The cuts should run from one end of the loaf to the other,  rather than across it, and the blade should be held at a 30 degree angle to  the loaf so that the cuts pop open in the oven. Be careful not to press  down too hard, or you may deflate the loaves. Using a plant sprayer, mist  the loaves. Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the  baguette mold in the oven. Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan  and quickly close the oven door. After 1 minute, mist the loaves and oven  walls 6 to 8 times and close the door. After 2 more minutes, spray the  loaves and the oven walls again. Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven  temperature to 400 degrees F and bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer until the  loaves are golden brown and crisp. Move them to a rack to cool. Enjoy your  baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, ripe French cheese and a  glass of wine. Note: If cake flour is not available, you can use the same  amount of unbleached all-purpose flour, but cake flour will give the  baguette a lighter texture.
