  "Instructions": "While the meat is cooking, toast the cumin seeds on a cast iron griddle and  then grind into a fine powder using a coffee mill or spice grinder and set  aside.    When the meat is cooked tender, set aside to cool. Separate the meat chunks  from the broth, reserving the broth. Shred the meat into small strands.    Heat 2 tablespoons of lard or shortening in a heavy pan, preferably cast  iron.  Add the chile seasoning and cumin and stir for a few seconds. Add  the meat and fry for two or three minutes. Add the reserved broth and  simmer until the liquid level is reduced. The mixture should be soupy. Set  aside to cool while you make the masa.    The Masa: The tamale dough, or masa, is made from masa harina, a corn flour  that is also used for making tortillas. Masa mix can be purchased in Latin  American markets or supermarkets that carry Latin American products. It can  also be purchased by mail order if not available locally. It is NOT the  same as corn meal.    I recently found a new version of Maseca brand masa that is specifically  formulated for tamales. It is a little coarser than the tortilla masa and  gives the tamales a better texture. If you are lucky enough to live in an  area with a large Hispanic population, you can buy prepared masa and save  yourself the trouble of having to mix it from scratch.    Combine masa, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Dissolve the boullion in  the lukewarm water to make a broth. Mix the broth into the masa a little at  a time, working with your fingers to make a moist dough.    In a small bowl, beat lard or shortening until fluffy, add to masa and beat  until masa has a spongy texture.    The Tamales: Remove a soaked corn husk from the water and shake to remove  excess water.  Start with the largest husks because they will be easier to  roll. If you end up with a lot of small husks, you can lay two together,  overlapping about 1/2\" but this is a little trickier and may take some  practice. Lay the husk flat on a plate and spread about 1 1/2 to 2  tablespoons (depending on the size of the husk) of masa in the center.  Dont use too much! The easiest way to spread the masa is to spoon it onto  the husk and spread it with your fingers. If the masa is sticky, wet your  hands.    Add about 1 tablespoon of meat filling on top of the masa. Again, dont use  too much.    Now comes the tricky part. Roll the corn husk so that the filling is  enclosed in the masa. Dont worry if the filling is not completely  surrounded with masa. When the masa cooks it will become firm and the  tamale will be fine. Fold over each end. If the husks are very thick, you  may find it difficult to fold the large end and get it to stay. If this is  the case, dont worry about folding the large end and put that end up when  you put the tamales into the steamer.    Load the tamales into a steamer standing them up vertically. I use a large  pot with a steamer basket in the bottom. When all the tamales are rolled,  and the steamer is full, cover with a damp cloth and steam until the  tamales are done, about 2 to 3 hours. During steaming it is very important  to keep the water at a low boil. Also, DO NOT let the steamer boil out of  water.    TIP: Place a coin, a penny works good, in the bottom of the steamer with  the water. You can tell when the water is boiling because you can hear the  coin rattling around. If the coin stops rattling, the water has boiled away  and you should add more.    After about 2 hours, you may want to pull out a tamale and sample it. Let  it cool for a few minutes and then unroll the husk. The tamale should be  soft and firm and not mushy.    Now you get to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Bite into one of these  delicacies and you will know the answer to the question \"Why am I doing  this?\" that you kept asking yourself while you were making them.    As I said in the beginning, tamales can be a lot of work, but they are  worth it and I strongly encourage you to give it a try. If you have further  questions, please send me mail and I will try to help.
