  "Instructions": "Contributed to the echo by: Leti Labell Prepare the corn husks: First go  through the corn husks, separating them, and removing pieces of cornsilk  (and also dirt, etc.) that you find. Then place them in a large bowl and  cover with tap water. (I put several plates on top of the corn husks to  hold them down, because they have a tendency to float.) Let them soak for  at least half an hour. Rinse the corn husks several times, to clean them.  Then drain them well. Next, dry off the corn husks. While you do this, you  can separate them into piles: big husks, medium, and too little to be worth  using. At this time, you can also prepare some thin strips of corn husk,  that you will use to tie the tamales together. (This is where you you the  little pieces too small to make a tamale.) (I found that the pieces werent  long enogh to tie around the tamales, so I tied two shorter pieces of thin  husk together. More on this later.) Make the tamales: Hold a large corn  husk in your hand, with the narrow end pointing to the right. Take a  spoonful of dough (I used a serving spoon, about 2 Tbs or so) and spread it  on the corn husk, about 1-1/2 inches from the wide end, and about 4 inches  from the narrow end. Spread the dough right up to the edge of the corn husk  on one side, leaving enough of a flap to wrap around the tamale. (If the  husk isnt wide enough for you to be able to wrap it around, youll use  another husk - more on this later.) Next, spread a spoonful (again, about 2  Tbs) of filling down the middle of the dough. Roll the sides of the corn  husk in toward the center, bringing the edges of the dough together,  enclosing the filling. Wrap the rest of the corn husk around to the back.  If there is not enough husk to wrap around to the back, place another corn  husk around the tamale, to hold the edge closed. Now, wrap the top (broad  end) edge down, and flip the bottom part (the narrow end) up, so that it  covers the edge of the broad end. Then, using the thin strips of corn husk,  tie across the middle to hold the top and bottom flaps in place. Steaming  the tamales: Stand the tamales on end in a steamer. If you dont have a  steamer, you could put the tamales in a metal collander, and place the  collander in a large pot. Just be sure that the tamales do not touch the  water below. Bring the water to a brisk boil, and steam the tamales for at  least an hour. I did it for an hour and 15 minutes. You can test one to see  if they are done: the dough will easily separate from the husk. Just be  careful - dont burn yourself on the steam! You can reheat tamales in the  oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. (Dont try to re-steam them.) If  you freeze them, you can reheat them by putting the frozen tamales in a  casserole dish, covering with foil, and heating in a 350 oven for 30-35  minutes. This was a lot of work, but it was well worth it!    ",
