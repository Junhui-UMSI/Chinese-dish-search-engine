  "Instructions": "Take a good quantity of Clay, and having moulded it, stick your Pig, and  blood him well, and when he is warm, put him in your prepared Coffin of  Clay, thick every where, with his Hair, Skin, and all (his Entrails drawn,  and Belly sowed up again) then throw him into the Oven, or below the  Stock-hole under the Furnace, and there let him soak, turn him now and then  when the clay is hardened for 12 hours, and he is then sufficiently baked,  then take him, and break off the Clay, which easily parts, and he will have  a fine crispy coat, and all the juice of the Pigg in your dish, remember  but to put a few leaves of Sage, and a little Salt in his belly, and you  need no other sauce.
