  "Instructions": "Yesterday we introduced the members of Recipe-a-Day to Soda Bread as  prepared in cake form. Today is the same recipe, but prepared as the farl.  This type of preparation is found more often in Northern Ireland and served  as a part of a traditional Irish Breakfast, or Ulster Fry is you prefer.    Sift the dry ingredients together several times in a large mixing bowl to  make sure the bicarbonate of soda is evenly distributed. Create a well in  the center of the dry ingredients and a pour about three-quarters of the  buttermilk into the center and start stirring. Continue to mix until you  achieve a dough that is raggy and very soft. Add more buttermilk sparingly  is you need it, as local conditions of humidity and temperature greatly  impact the mixture.    Blend quickly, but not too energetically until the whole mass of dough has  become a floury, raggy consistency. Turn the contents of the bowl out onto  a lightly floured surface and start to knead the bread.    Your primary concern is speed in kneading. The chemical reaction of the  bicarbonate of soda with the acidic buttermilk starts as soon as they meet.  You need to get the Soda Bread into the oven while the reactions running  high, so dont over knead. Spend about 30-seconds kneading the dough and  shape the bread into a slightly domed circle about 6 to 8-inches in  diameter. Cut the circle of dough into four equal sections and try not to  crush or compress the dough when you make the cuts. A clean slicing motion  with a sharp knife is required.    To complete the farl prepare your best cast iron griddle or fry pan for  cooking. Pre-heat the pan over a medium-low setting. Dust a hot griddle or  frying pan with a little flour, and place the farl or farls gently on the  hot griddle. The cut edges should be 1/2 inch or so apart to allow for  expansion during cooking. Grill or fry the farls about 20-minutes on each  side until well toasted in color. The farls will scorch easily, so keep an  eye on the heat and adjust accordingly. The heat source should be very low  when the farls are finished.    Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by The Cook & Kitchen Staff  <dailyrecipe-owner@recipe-a-day.com> on Mar 04, 1998",
