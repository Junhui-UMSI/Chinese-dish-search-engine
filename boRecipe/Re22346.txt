  "Instructions": "These instructions are for a medium-sized turkey, (16-18 lbs.). Use about 1  1/2 cup salt for med. turkey and enough ice water to cover. Mix some ice  water with the salt and stir it up, then add more water and your turkey.  Let the turkey remain covered in the brine overnight. In the morning,  preheat oven to 475 F., take your turkey out of the brine and rinse, inside  and out really well, then dry well. Put on rack breast side down and put  into hot oven. After 20 minutes, turn oven down to 300 F. After 1 1/2  hours, turn the turkey breast side up and continue to roast until the  breast meat reaches a temperature of 153 F. (I took my 22 lb. turkey out  when the thermometer read 155 F.). Let the turkey sit for at least 15  minutes, preferably a little longer. My turkey was soooo good! Not salty at  all. Another thing Shirley Corriher suggested was to add about 3 Tb. dark  Karo syrup to a half stick of butter to use for basting ( I didnt have the  dark Karo syrup, so I used the light. And since my turkey was big, I used a  little more than a stick of butter with about 4 Tb. of the syrup.) The  turkey was a beautifully browned! The author states that absorbing water  while in the brine makes for a juicier bird.  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #422 by pat hogberg  <p_hogberg@hotmail.com> on Nov 29, 1997",
