  "Instructions": "RO*TEL originated in the sun-drenched Lower Rio Grande Valley of  Texas, where for a long time it remained the best kept secret in the  country. In the 1940s, cans were only shipped as far away as San  Antonio and Houston and Dallas. Later, RO*TEL Tomatoes and Green  Chilies had slipped their way to the foreign side of the Red River  and were being sopped up in Oklahoma and Arkansas.    In 1963, the wife of one of the countrys best-known politicians in  Washington bragged about her recipe for homemade chili in a national  magazine. And, lo and behold, she wrote that her main secret  ingredient was a healthy dose of RO*TEL Tomatoes and Green Chilies.    The rest, as they say, is lots of tasty history. today, with southwest  cooking rampant from sea to shining sea, RO*TEL can be found just  about everywhere. Its the single best seasoning sauce for  southwestern cooking a persons gonna find. Youll even find RO*TEL  at a certain important address on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,  D.C. Thats because the Number One favorite snack of the President  himself, according to newspapers all over the country, if Famous  RO*TEL Cheese Dip - the recipe right off the RO*TEL can, which is  also printed here on page 3.    If you havent tried RO*TEL, youre in for a treat. As Crazy Sam puts  it: \"Have some and youll wind up grinning like apossum thats been  eating green persimmons.\"    Only RO*TEL is a heckuva lot better.
