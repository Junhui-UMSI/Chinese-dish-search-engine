  "Instructions": "This should answer all your questions about the care and feeding of  woks.    A Wok That Can Rust Is a Wok Worth Cleaning by Joyce Jue    Recently, a reader wrote asking if he should throw out his rusty wok  and start with a new one.  Keep it!  An old wok that can rust is a  wok worth owning.    Unless the cooking surface has deep pits from rust, a wok can be  cleaned and reseasoned.  It should stir-fry better than when it was  new.    Wok Talk:    Why an I writing about woks again?  Because the \"rusty wok\" question  is the one Im most frequently asked, followed by:  How do you season  a----wok??    If you want to feel like a Chinese cook and produce dishes that taste  authentically Chinese, I highly recommend using a carbon spun-steel  or thin iron wok for stir-frying.  Both require initial seasoning,  but regular use will maintain the seasoning and eventually produce a  shiny black patina finish.    Chinese cooks are persnickety about their woks.  It takes time, care  and lots of cooking before a wok develops a patina that almost  impervious black coating found on well-used woks.  The ultimate goal  is for the wok to impart wok hay, an elusive pan flavor and aroma  that is associated with Chinese restaurant dishes.    Actually, wok hay comes from cooking over extremely high heat in a  well-seasoned pan.    Finely Tuned Implement:    Once a wok imparts wok hay, it is respected like a finely-tuned  instrument.    A well-seasoned wok is almost non-stick.  I often stir-fry vegetables  using just a thin film of surface oil.    As the patina builds up, less cooking oil is required.    A wok is quite sturdy.  It stands up to high heat better than any  other cooking pan.  It seems impervious to being banged or battered -  I have accidentally dropped mine down four flights of concrete stairs  and it came through intact with patina unscratched.    A woks worst enemies are soap and scouring pads - theyll remove any  seasoning the wok has acquired.    Until a wok takes on a shiny, smooth, black patina, the initial  seasoning must be strengthened by frequent use of the pan, and  fortified by an occasional light re-seasoning.    There is no shortcut to achieving a perfectly seasoned wok.  It comes  from use.    Seasoning: To season a new carbon spun-steel wok or to re-season an  old rusty wok, thoroughly scrub it inside and out with soap and a  steel wool scouring pad to remove the manufacturers protective  coating on a new wok, or the rust on an old one.  Rinse thoroughly  with hot water.  Some manufacturers apply a coating that is hard to  remove, so set the wok on the stove, fill it with water and boil it  for several minutes until the coating dissolves.  Pour out the water  and scrub the surface clean with steel wool and soap.    Set the clean wok over high heat.  Heat until a few drops of water  sprinkled into the wok immediately turn into dancing beads.  While  the pan is heating, it will change from shiny steel gray to blue,  purple, red and, finally, black.    Dip several sheets of wadded-up paper towel into peanut or corn oil  and wipe the oil on the entire inside surface of the wok (you may  want to use long-handled tongs to hold the towels).  Reduce heat to  low and let the wok sit over the heat for 15 minutes to absorb the  oil - the color changes will continue and, hopefully, the bottom of  the wok will darken. In time and with frequent use the entire wok  will turn black. if the surface looks dry, wipe with another thin  film of oil.  Remove wok from the burner and let it cool.    Reheat the wok and repeat the oiling and heating process once more  before using it for stir-frying.    S.F. Chronicle, 9/18/91.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; December 13 1991.
