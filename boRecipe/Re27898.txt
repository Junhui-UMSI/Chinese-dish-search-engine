  "Instructions": "Combine the rice, water, and salt in a large saucepan, cover, and bring to  a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer. Cook for 45 to 60 minutes, until all the  water is absorbed and the rice is quite soft.    \"Cooked whole grain rice and salt are the only ingredients in these crispy  thins. It may take you a couple of tries to perfect the rolling technique.  They key to success is to cook the rice in more water and for much longer  than you would ordinarily. It should be very soft and mushy. Eat these rice  cakes with fruit and cheese, or crack them into soups. 325~ F 45 to 55  minutes Preheat the oven to 325~ F.    Taste the rice and add salt to taste. Stir the rice well with a fork until  mushy. Cut six sheets of parchement paper or wax paper the size of your  largest baking sheet. (Parchment paper works best.) While the rice is still  warm, measure out a third of it, about one cup, into the center of a sheet  of the paper. Using your hands, shape the rice into a flat disk.    Place a second sheet of paper over the rice and roll out to about 3/16 inch  thick. Keep the thickness as uniform as possible throughout. Carefully peel  off the top sheet of paper.    If you are using parchment paper, simply place the rolled rice, bottom  sheet of paper and all, on an ungreased baking sheet.    If you are using wax paper, you will need to grease your baking sheet  lightly. Then pick up the wax paper and rolled rice and flip it, rice side  down, onto the sheet. Then carefully peel the wax paper off the top. The  wax paper may stick to the rice, but dont worry if holes form in spots.  You are going to crack these crisps up anyway when they cool. Use a metal  spatula to loosen the wax paper if necessary.    Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until crisp. Begin rolling the next 2 crisps  while the first is baking. If the edges get done before the centers, gently  break them off and allow the rest to continue baking.    Cool the large crisps on racks and break into irregularly shaped individual  crackers. Yield: 3 large rice cakes.    VARIATIONS: Add 2 to 3 Tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, or your favorite  herbs, to the rice after cooking.    ",
