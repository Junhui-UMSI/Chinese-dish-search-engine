  "Instructions": "Heat the heavy cream and half-and-half in a 2 1/2-qt  saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 cup  sugar. Stir to dissolve and bring the  mixture to a boil, about 10 to 12 minutes.    While the cream is heating, place the egg yolks and  the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an electric  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the yolks on high for  2 to 2 1/2 minutes, then scrape down the sides of the  bowl. Beat  on high, until slightly thickened and lemon-colored,  and additional 2 1/2 to  3 minutes. (At this point, the cream should be  boiling. If not, adjust mixer  speed to low and continue to mix until the cream  boils. If this is not done,  the egg yolks will develop undesirable lumps.)  Pour the boiling cream into the beaten egg yolks and  whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over  medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream  reaches a temperature of 185 degrees, 2 to 4 minutes.  Add the  rum and combine thoroughly. Remove from the heat and  transfer to a stainless  steel bowl. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a  temperature of 40 to 45 degrees, about 20 minutes.  When the mixture is cold, freeze in an ice-cream  freezer following the manufacturers instructions.  Transfer the semifrozen ice cream to the plastic  container that is holding the chocolate pecan crunch.  Stir with a rubber spatula to thoroughly combine the  crunch with the semifrozen ic cream. Securely cover  the container, then place in the  freezer several hours before serving. Serve within 3  days.    Source: Death By Chocolate Cookbook by Marcel  Desaulniers    ",
