  "Instructions": "The key to good Buffalo Wings is how you prepare them as well as the  ingredients and the handling of the wings. The most successful wings served  up here in Buffalo are what they call \"Grade A Grinders.\" Fresh wings that  are very large and meaty.  Usually, you cannot get them in a frozen  package, but can get them from a poultry dealer. Once you find them make  sure they are absolutely fresh. Wash them in cold water, split them at the  joint and remove the tips. Place them on a rack on a pan and refrigerate  overnight to let the blood and water drain out of the wings. THIS IS A REAL  KEY.  Drying the wings under refrigeration will help to make them a much  crispier product, once deep fried. Next, use a deep fryer or a very heavy  deep pot with a thermometer and add the oil. Peanut oil is very good, or a  commercial product such as can be found at a restaurant cash and carry  called Mel Fry. Heat the oil up SLOWLY, to 365F, and depending on the size  of the fryer, deep fry the dry wings 6-8 minutes in small batches, until  thoroughly done and golden brown. Hold the cooked wings in a warm oven if  necessary. A combination of melted margarine and hot sauce in the ratio of  1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce will add the right zing. The key here  is to add just enough sauce to coat the wings - the more sauce you add, the  hotter they will be.  For the very brave, 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot  sauce and 1 part Tabasco is referred to as \"Suicidal Wings\" by the late and  dear Don Bellissimo, who owned the Anchor Bar. Working quickly, place the  deep fried wings in a large bowl and add the sauce mixture, shaking to coat  them. There are many good hot sauces to use; the one they use is either  Durkee Franks Red Hot Sauce or Wingers Original, again found in a  restaurant cash and carry. Celery sticks and chunky blue cheese dressing  (Kens Buffalo Style Blue Cheese is a popular one) and plenty of napkins.    ",
