  "Instructions": "Pickled Plums    Use 5 pounds plums; wipe with damp cloth and prick several times with large  needle.  Boil 5-2/3 cups sugar, 1 quart vinegar and cloth bag contining 1  ounce whole cloves, 1 ounce allspice berries, 1 ounce mace and 2 ounces  stick cinnamon; pour over plums and let stand overnight. Drain again, cook  syrup point, remove spice bag, pack in clean hot jars and seal at once.  Approximate yield: 5 pint jars.    This recipe was printed before it was recommended to water bath everything,  but between the fruit and the vinegar, I wouldnt think it would be over 10  minutes.    Damson Plum Conserve    Use 2 pounds plums, pitted and chopped, 1 orange, chopped and cooked 20  minutes in 2 cups water, 1/2 cup raisins and 3 cups sugar. When thick, add  1/4 cup chopped walnut meats. Approx. yield: 6 (6 oz.) glasses.    Plum Butter    Use 4 pounds plums; add 2/3 cup sugar for each cup pulp. Approximate yield:    1 1/2    quarts butter.    Plum Surprise    2 large oranges                   1/4 cup honey 12 plums 1/2 cup shredded  coconut 1 cup heavy cream, whipped    Peel oranges and cut each in 6 slices.  Cut plums in quarters, removing  pits; roll in honey, then in coconut. Arrange a slice of orange on each of  6 desert plates; place 4 plum quarters on top and top with cream. Cover  with orange slice, top with cream and garnish dish with 4 plum quarters.  Yield: 6 portions.    Brandied Plum Sauce    Stew washed plums or prunes in water to cover about 10 minutes, or until  soft, adding sugar to taste when half done; to 1-1/2 cups sauce, add 2  tbsp. brandy and serve on ice cream or other desserts.    Frozen Plum Pudding    1/4 cup currants                   3 tbsp. shredded figs 1/4 cup seeded  raisins             1/2 cup maraschino cordial 1/4 cup finely shredded  citron     3 tbsp. blanched chopped almonds 12 maraschino cherries, chopped 1 quart  chocolate ice cream 3 tbsp. shredded dates    Wash currants, add raisins, and steam or simmer in small amount of water 5  minutes, or until plump; drain and cool. Marinate all other fruits in  maraschino cordial 6 hours; combine fruits and nuts, and mix into ice  cream. Turn into freezing trays of automatic refrigerator and freeze 2 to 4  hours, or until firm. Approximate yield: 3 pints.    Sorry about this one.  I had it all typed in and realized that there arent  any plums in it. Red Plum Ice Cream    8 red plums                        1 tsp. gelatin 3/4 cup sugar 2 tbsp.  cold water 1 1/2 cups water 2 tbsp. lemon juice 2 tbsp. corn syrup 1 cup  heavy cream, whipped    Cook plums with sugar and water about 15 minutes, or until soft; remove  stones and force pulp through sieve. Add corn syrup and gelatin, softened  in cold water, and stir over heat until dissolved; cool. Add lemon juice  and fold in cream; turn into freezing tray of automatic refrigerator with  temperature control set at coldest point. Freeze 2 to 4 hours, or until  frozen to the desired consistency, stirring once during freezing.  Approximate yield:  6 portions.    ",
