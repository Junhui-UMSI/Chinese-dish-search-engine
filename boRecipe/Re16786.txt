  "Instructions": "CHOCOLATE LEAVES:  Select non-poisonous leaves such as mint or rose leaves.  Wash the leaves and pat dry with paper towels. Melt 1 or 2 (1-ounce)  squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double boiler; let cool  slightly.  Using a small spatula, spread a thin layer of chocolate on the  back of each leaf.  Place leaves on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet,  chocolate side up; freeze until chocolate is firm, about 10 minutes. Grasp  leaf at stem end and carefully peel away from chocolate. Chill leaves until  ready to use.    CHOCOLATE CURLS:  Melt 4 (1-ouce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot  water in a double bliler.  Pour chocolate out into a wax paper-lined cookie  sheet. Spread chocolate with a spatula into a 3-inch-wide strip. Smooth top  with a spatula.  Chill chocolate until it feels slightly tacky but not  firm.  (If too hard, curls will break; if too soft, chocolate will not  curl.)  Gently pull a vegetable peeler across chocolate until curls form.  Transfer curls to a tray by inserting a wooden pick in end of curl. Chill  curls until ready to use. CHOCOLATE-DIPPED FRUIT: Make sure fruit is  completely dry before dipping. Melt 4 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate  over hot vater in a double boiler; transfer to a small bowl, and let cool  slightly.  Grasp fruit by stem and dip in chocolate, turning to coat the  bottom of the fruit. Allow excess to drip back into bowl. Lay fruit on side  on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Allow fruit to stand at room temperature  until chocolate hardens or place in refrigerator about 10 minutes. Dont  store coated fruit in refrigerator; the chocolate coating will sweat when  returned to room temperature and will lose its sheen. CHOCOLATE CUTOUTS:  Melt 6 (1-ounce) squares semisweet chocolate over hot water in a double  boiler; cool slightly. Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil; pour the  chocolate onto the cookie sheet, and gently shake it until chocolate is  smooth and level and about 1/8-inch thick. Let stand until partially set.  Press a cookie cutter half-way through the chocolate to outline shapes.  Remove the cutter, and let stand until chocolate is firm. When hard,  reposition the cutter over the oulines, and press down to cut smoothly.  Lift the cutter up, and remove the cutout by gently pressing through the  cutter with a small wooden utensil (fingers will leave prints on  chocolate). GRATED CHOCOLATE: You can grate unsweetened, semisweet, or milk  chocolate to sprinkle on top of pies, etc. Its easiest done in a food  processor, but you can grate it by hand. When grating by hand, hold  chocolate with a paper towel or wax paper so heat from your hand will not  soften or melt the chocolate.
