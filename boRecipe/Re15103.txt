  "Instructions": "5. Glaze and apply topping: This step is not essential to the final  product.    6. Bake: Bake in a preheated oven for 20 to 35 minutes.    STEP 1: MIX, KNEAD AND FIRST RISE:    The Bread Machine:    The bread machine yields excellent results every time when you use fresh  ingredients and follow directions. Set the machine on \"dough cycle\", and  let it produce a dough with the texture of velvet and the stiff consistency  required.    When using a bread machine, add ingredients in the order recommended in  your manufacturers instructions. The recipes in this series have  ingredients listed for machines that require adding liquids first and dry  components last.    Reverse the order for those that add dry ingredients first and wet ones  last. Process on the \"dough mode,\" or \"program\", or \"mix bread cycle\" or  whatever it is termed by your machines instructions. Allow the dough to  rise through the full first rise period after the kneading phase, between       35    minutes and 1 hour.    On shorter cycles, and depending on the weather and moisture of the  ingredients, you may have to leave it in the machine for 10 or 15 minutes  longer, or until the dough fills about 2/3 of the pan. Whole grain flours  may require up to 1 to 2 hours for the first rise. Do not allow the dough  to bake in the machine.    Dry ingredients such as spices, cinnamon, nutmeg and finely chopped nuts  are added with the fours at the beginning. Wet ingredients such as mashed  bananas, applesauce, pumpkin, grated carrots and frozen berries are added  with the liquids, but if you add more wet ingredients to the recipes in  this series, their liquid content must replace an equal amount of liquid.  Adding raisins and other dried fruits at the beginning is not recommended;  most bread machines pulverize them so theyre hardly visible in the  finished bagel.    Check dough about 5 minutes after you have started the machine. The dough  should form a nice round ball. If a ball doesnt form, and the mixture  appears crumbly, add water, a tablespoon or less at a time, until the  correct consistency is achieved. If dough looks too wet or formless, add  flour, a tablespoon or less at a time, until the dough forms a ball.    Add ingredients such as raisins, dates, chocolate chips and apple pieces  about 5 to 8 minutes before the end of the kneading phase. Some machine  beep to indicate the optimum time to add nuts or raisins. Check your  manufacturers instructions for the time required for each process in the  dough cycle. If your machine does not provide this timed signal, determine  the length of the kneading phase and set a timer for 5 minutes before the  end; then open the machine and carefully add the ingredients, being sure  that they do not spill onto the heating elements. Ingredients can also be  kneaded into the dough by hand after it is removed from the machine.    NOTE: When adding reconstituted dried foods to the dough in a bread machine  (5 to 10 minutes before the end of the kneading phase), foods should be  blotted very dry with a paper towel so that any retained moisture does not  change the texture of the dough and inhibit it from rising properly.    A 60 minute rise period is ideal. Its ok to open the machine and quickly  test the dough during the rise period. Gently push your finger into the  dough, and if the dent remains, dough is ready. If the impression bounces  back, let dough rise a few minutes longer and retest. Dough can become  slack if allowed to rise too long. White flour rises highest. White flour  combined with whole wheat, rye and oats will not rise as high. Generally,  the darker the dough, the lower the rise and the longer it takes.    When ready, remove dough form the pan and proceed to Shape Bagels.    THE FOOD PROCESSOR    A food processor will knead dough ingredients very quickly and easily. It  will reduce the process to a few minutes, even cutting down the time of the  a bread machine. Our testers found the results extremely reliable. One  tester much preferred it to the bread machine because he was in charge all  the way and never had a failure. By mixing and kneading in the food  processor and allowing the dough to rise in the microwave, bagels can be  ready for boiling in under a half hour. You can optionally use the  microwave for the first rise for dough that has been mixed in the bread  machine, by hand or with an electric mixer. Then work the flavoring  ingredients into the dough after the first rise as you would for dough made  in the bread    continued in part 3",
