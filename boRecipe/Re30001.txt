  "Instructions": "1. Heat oven to 150 ?C to 160 ?C .    2. Make the syrup first. Boil the water and sugar for 15 minutes. Add lemon  juice, boil 10 more minutes, set aside to cool.    3. Make the filling: Mix all ingredients well. I prefer the walnuts fairly  coarse; some people like them quite fine.    4. Cut the dough with scissors to the size of the tray. Handle the dough  very carefully; do not press hard on it at any time. Cover with wax paper  and damp towel.    5. Take out one sheet of dough at a time and place it in the pan. Brush the  dough with melted butter between each layer. Continue until you have about  12 sheets buttered. Small and broken pieces of dough can be used in the  center, but there must be butter between every two layers.    6. Spread walnut filling across the tray.    7. Put on a sheet of dough, brush on butter, and continue until all the  dough is used up.    8. Cut into diamond shapes: cut into quarters with cuts parallel to the  long axis, then cut diagonally across. Dont press hard!    9. Bake for about 1 1/2 hour, until golden brown. Be careful not to burn  the bottom or the walnuts, especially with a glass pan.    10. Let cool on rack for 5 minutes. Add syrup which should have cooled to  room temperature. Let cool for at least two hours before eating.    Authors Notes: Baklava is claimed by almost every Balkan state as its own  invention; most people in the United States first encounter it in Greek  restaurants. If the truth were known, its probably the Turkish who  invented it, as is the case for many other ``typically Greek dishes. This  recipe comes from my Bulgarian grandmother, and follows Bulgarian  tradition, in that the filling is very simple.    Probably the hardest thing about this recipe is waiting those last two  hours! Depending on where you go, youll hear the name of this dish  pronounced different ways. I pronounce the name with all /ah/ sounds, with  accents of equal intensity on both the first and third syllable. The second  syllable is quite faint. Greek-speaking persons typically put a heavy  accent on the second syllable. Many variations on the filling are to be  found. A simple one was mentioned above, regarding the coarseness of grind  of the walnuts in the filling. They may even be ground. Spices such as  chopped cloves or cinnamon may be added, and the filling may be included in  several layers instead of just one. A large pan is almost too big to  handle. I typically make this recipe in two pans, which is just about the  size of a half sheet of the dough I buy. By the way, if you can make your  own strudel dough, it will be even better ... but much more effort. It is  best to have a partner help you prepare the pans. One person handles the  dough and places it in the pan, while the other applies the butter. It is  very important that sufficient butter be placed between layers so that each  layer gets flaky, rather than having them stick together. Pay particular  attention to the edges and corners. In case you havent noticed, this is  very sweet stuff. It goes great with a fine cup of coffee, espresso, or  Turkish coffee, even with sugar. Two pieces will probably fill anyone up;  it refrigerates and freezes quite well. This recipe requires a lot of  effort, but its well worth it.    Difficulty : moderate to hard. Precision  : measure the ingredients.
