  "Instructions": "Preparation time:  1/2 day, but constant attention is not required.    Simmer the sauce, stirring until the sugar is melted.  Then, stir  occasionally for a few minutes while the oil is drawn out of the  lemon. Do not allow to scorch.  Remove from heat and set aside.    Broil the ribs flesh side up until browned.  Turn and cook flesh side  down, brown again.  Now brush both sides with some of the sauce and  cook on each side for five minutes.  Do not let them burn or blacken!  The RIBS at this point look good, but they are still raw.    Cut the ribs apart and dip each rib in the sauce.  Pile the ribs high  on a full-sized oven broiler rack and pan, and pour any remaining  sauce, less a cup or so, over the ribs.    Cover the ribs with heavy-duty aluminium foil, tucking in around the  outside edge of the pan to make an airtight container. Cook in the  oven at 325F for 2 hours.    Remove from oven and open very carefully.  Beware the live steam that  will rush out.  Allow to sit, opened for a few minutes.    The end result is smoked, steamed, tender meat which falls from the  bones. All fat is rendered and drains into the pan.    Use leftover sauce when warming over the second day.    SAUCE VARIATION: Molasses, tomato paste, onion, spices    Unfortunately I dont have anyplace to grill outdoors so can first  part of the recipe (which calls for outdoor grilling) be substituted  by putting the ribs in the oven?    Rinse and dry ribs; then cut apart.  Heat about 3 cups oil in a wok.  When very hot, add ribs in small batches and fry until brown and  crispy, about 5 minutes.  Remove and drain.    [They are absolutely delicious at this point.  Once I forgot to make  the sauce until I was half done eating the ribs!  Theyre great  served at this point with various Chinese dips ++mustard with a dish  of chopped scallions, hoisin sauce, chili sauces, etc.  S.C.]    Combine sugar, vinegar, salt and soy sauce.  Remove oil from wok;  return wok to stove and turn heat to high.  When hot, add vinegar  mixture. Cook, stirring, over high heat until syrupy.  Add ribs; toss  in the mixture until well coated.  Serve warm or at room temperature.    San Francisco Chronicle, date unknown...    I have never tried that, but I suspect a compromise could be worked.  Most of the actual cooking occurs during the oven portion.  The  purpose of the outdoor grilling is to both sear and seal the meat,  and impart the unique flavor of barbecue to the ribs by exposing it  to the smoke created when the drippings from the meat vaporize on the  hot briquets.  An additional (and desirable) flavor is also imparted  to the meat if real charcoal briquets are used.    The addition of the \"Secret Sauce\" during the last portion of the  outdoor phase also contributes to the taste.    As a non-outside alternative, I would suggest oven broiling of the  ribs as a substitute for the outdoor searing.  During the final  portion, the coating of the slabs could still be done (the 5 minutes  per side part).    To possibly aid in giving a barbecue-like flavor, a drop or two of  liquid smoke could be added **only** to the small portion of the  sauce that is used to coat the ribs during the searing process.  Theres a possibility the time under the broiler may need to be  shortened when compared with the outside method.    Liquid smoke is a very potent ingredient, and I have never found it  satisfactory for my own use.  Obviously, some must, as it is still  sold. As a rule of thumb, I would advise forgetting about the amount  recommended for use on the bottle, and if in doubt, \"use less\". Then,  following the oven broiling, you can continue by cutting the ribs  apart, and continuing by the recipe.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; October 5 1992.
