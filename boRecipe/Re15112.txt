  "Instructions": "WONDER what the Dominos people do when theyre not rushing pizzas all over  creation? They take surveys, or they say they do. The companys mighty  public relations machine offers these observations:    Men wearing muscle shirts when answering the door order pepperoni three  times more often than any other topping.    People who have pierced noses, lips or eyebrows ask for a vegetarian  topping 23 percent more often than a meat topping. Those who have wind  chimes on the porch are four times more likely than the average to want  olives.    A recurring element is the correlation between pizza-eating and  TV-watching. Whatever day and time Roseanne\" airs is always the biggest  half-hour of the week for meat-topped pizza orders. Since you asked, the  No. 1 pizza-ordering show (figured by comparing orders during its time slot  with weeks when the show doesnt air) is \"Melrose Place,\" which is also by  far the leading show for vegetable-topped pizzas. Pizza orders in the  \"Melrose Place\" time slot have gone up 14 percent since Heather Locklear  joined the cast.    Theres more: As you look back on 1994, trying to make sense of Newts rise  and O.J.s fall, you may want to consider these other statistics from  Dominos Since the Republicans won the election, meat-topped pizza orders  have risen 32 percent in the Washington metropolitan area. Since Election  Day, tipping of Dominos deliverers by Washington women has fallen off by  10 percent (except during \"Melrose Place,\" when it climbs by 30 percent).    Since the election, tipping by House Republicans has been down 12 percent;  tipping by House Democrats has been up 3 percent. Whenever Newt Gingrich  appears on national television, pizza orders to Democratic offices go up 4  percent and go down 2 percent on the GOP side.    And last, but not least The single greatest hour for pizza delivery in  national pizza history was the hour when O. J. Simpson was in the white  Ford Bronco on the L. A. freeways.
