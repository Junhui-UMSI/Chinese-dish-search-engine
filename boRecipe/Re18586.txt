  "Instructions": "Cook up lots of chopped  onions and some hamburger meat (the amount  depended upon how flush the pocket book was at the time). Of course, my  mother used to use a little bacon fat in the pan to begin with, and drain  off any extra fat from the hamburger, tho we raised our own meat, and it  was pasture fed, pretty lean.  Meanwhile get a BIG pot of water boiling and  cook up a mess of elbow macaroni - depending on how much you need to  stretch the recipe.  We always used \"the macaroni kettle\", and woe if  something else was in it.   Remember - I made this for 14 people, and I  still always make too much.  And we are not talking pasta here, we need  plain old Prince elbow macaroni.  Here is where my  family added their own  touch.  Rather than Campbells tomato soup, we used our own home grown  canned tomatoes. My mother used to can about 200 quarts a season. So dump a  quart or so of good thick canned tomatoes (break up the whole tomatoes a  bit)  in with the hamburger and onions, add the macaroni, and salt and  pepper to taste.  Serve up in big bowls with homemade bread.  We came to  like it best made this way.   If you use the Campbells tomato soup  variation, just add enough soup to make the mixture nice and gooey. Some  people, being fancier than we were, would put the whole mixture in a big  casserole dish, top it with buttered bread crumbs and bake it for a short  time in the oven.  This used to appear at Pot-Luck Suppers with great  regularity.
