  "Instructions": "To Assemble:  ============         Place 1 sheet of the prepared dough on ravioli form or work  surface.  Dot with 18 teaspoonfuls of filling placed 1 inch apart.  Using a pastry brush dipped in cold water, moisten dough between  mounds of filling.         Gently lay a second sheet of pasta on top of the first sheet with  its mounds of filling, pressing between carefully between the mounds  of filling to seal the two sheets together.  Cut the dough into neat  squares.  Repeat, using remaining 2 sheets of pasta and remaining  filling.  Set aside on lightly floured baking sheet.         Preheat oven to 450 F.  Bring the cream and remaining 1/2 cup of  chopped shallot to a simmer then set aside.         Cook the ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water for 2  minutes.  Drain and immediately transfer to wide, shallow baking dish.         Pour the cream and shallot over the ravioli and bake until the  cream is bubbly and has thickened slightly, 5 to 8 minutes.         Meanwhile, place the trimmed sweetbreads and Bordelaise Sauce or  Veal Stock in small saucepan.  Simmer, uncovered, until the mixture is  reduced to syrupy consistency.         Transfer ravioli and cream to warm serving plates.  Spoon a few  pieces of sweetbreads with their sauce into the center of each  portion.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve immediately.
