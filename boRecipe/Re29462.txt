  "Instructions": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In medium bowl, combine baking mix and milk;  stir until blended. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead  briefly (about 10 times). With lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough out  to 1/2-inch thickness. Using 2 1/2-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter, cut  out dough. Place biscuits about 2-inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake until golden about 10 minutes. Serve warm. Makes 6 biscuits.    Note: These biscuits can be served as a side dish or quick snack. They are  also great split and filled with savory ingredients for sandwiches or with  sliced, seasonal fruit for dessert.    PER BISCUIT: 145CAL.; 4G PROT.; 4G TOTAL FAT (1G SAT. FAT); 23G CARB.; 3MG  CHOL.; 163MG SOD.; 1G FIBER. LACTO    Abstract: The magazine staff took a traditional Bisquick-style baking mix  and modified it to include whole grains and less salt. The new recipe can  be used to make muffins, pancakes and bread.    For moistness, we used light stick margarine, whic also helps to reduce the  fat content. A vegan variation is as follows: Prepare the mix using vegan  margarine and omit the powdered milk. When youre ready to prepare  biscuits, pancakes, etc., add 1/2 cup water, soy or rice milk for every 2  cups of mix.    The staff found that the baking mix made great biscuits, pancakes and  muffins. With the use of leftover vegetables, fruit, spices, nuts, cheeses  and herbs, the possible variations on these themes are endless.    Source: Vegetarian Times, Sep 1997 n241 p32(2).
