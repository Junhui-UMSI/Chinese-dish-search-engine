  "Instructions": "Pickles, relishes, and chutneys are vegetables prepared with brine  (salt and water) or vinegar and some sugar and spices. The vinegar  acts as a preservative, keeping any spoilage organisms from growing.  Sealing pickled foods in jars and processing in a boiling water bath  helps keep them fresh, crisp, and free from mold.    Whole, sliced, or chunked vegetables cooked in vinegar or a vinegar  sugar syrup, can become pickles. Chopped or ground combinations  cooked with vinegar, sugar, and spices become relishes. Chutneys are  highly spiced fruit and/or vegetable combinations.    The old fashioned dill pickles and sauerkraut are actually fermented  in brine, rather than cooked in vinegar. The brine, plus the sugar  from the cucumber or cabbage, promote a special kind of bacterial  action that, over several days or weeks, changes cucumbers to pickles  and transforms cabbage to kraut.    PICKLING POINTERS Because certain ingredients are very important for  proper pickling, youll need to be aware of some of the following  pointers.    1. Use produce that is as fresh as possible. Take it from the garden  to your kitchen and into jars just as rapidly as possible. If you  cant process the produce immediately, be sure to keep it  refrigerated. Vegetables should be just barely ripe; theyll keep  their shape better than if they were fully ripe. Always select  cucumber varieties that have been created for pickling. The large  salad cucumbers were developed for salads, not for pickles. Use  smaller, less pretty cukes, with pale skins, plenty o bumps, and  black spines. Never use waxed cucumbers. Select evenly shaped and  sized vegetables for even cooking and better looking pickles.    2. Water is an important pickle ingredient, especially for long brined  pickles. Soft water is best. Hard water can cloud the brine or  discolor the pickles. If you dont have soft water, boil hard water  for 15 minutes, then let it stand overnight. Skim off the scum, then  carefully dip out what you need so you wont get any sediment from  the bottom. Then add 1 tablespoon of salt for each gallon; or you cn  use distilled water if your water is hard.    3. Salt, too, makes a difference. Table salt contains special  additives to prevent it from caking in your shaker, and these  materials can cloud brine. Iodized salt can darken brine. use only  pure, granulated salt, also known as kosher salt, pickling salt, or  dairy salt. Most supermarkets stock it with canning supplies.    4. Vinegar is a crucial ingredient for many pickle recipes. check the  label when you shop, and be sure to get a good quality vinegar of  from 4 to 6 percent acidity. (Sometimes listed as 40 to 60 grain.)  Weaker vinegar will not pickles foods. use distilled white vinegar  for light colored pickles, cider vinegar for darker foods or more  interesting flavor.    5. Sugar can be brown or white granulated, depending on the lightness  or darkness of food to be pickled. Or, if you wish, use half corn  syrup or honey and half sugar. Dont use sugar substitutes unless you  follow their manufacturers directions.    6. spices must be fresh. Old spices will make your pickles taste  musty. Most recipes call for whole spices, which give stronger flavor  and dont color the pickles as much. It is suggested you tie the  spices in a cheesecloth bag and add them to the kettle during  cooking, then remove the bag before packing the pickles into jars.  Some cooks like to leave whole spices in the jars for stronger flavor  and just for appearances sake, but loose spices may darken the  pickles somewhat.    7. Alum, lime, and other ingredients added to crisp or color pickles  are not necessary, and their use is not recommended. These  ingredients are often found in old fashioned recipes. Most of the  newer recipes wont need any of these additives.
