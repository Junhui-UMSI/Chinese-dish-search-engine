SHMATEH (shmah teh): A rag. An old, tattered housedress. In NY,  people refer to the garment business as the shmateh business. Your wife  just bought a dress for $50 to wear to a party. She meets a friend who who  has an Oleg Cassini dress on and paid $5,000 for it. She is paid a  compliment by the friend with the Oleg Cassini dress, and her response is,  \"this old shmateh, just something I was giving to Goodwill\". SHMEI-DREI  (shmy-dry): Empty talk; baloney. \"Shmei-drei, who cares?\" SHMUTZ (shmutz):  Dirt.  Your mother-in-law wears her white gloves to your house, and runs  her hand down the furniture looking for shmutz, so she can tell her  daughter-in-law its time to clean. SHTICK (shtick): Literally, a piece.  Popularly, its a persons \"thing\" or habit. Dean Martins sctick is booze.  With Don Rickles is insulting people. With some people its their MM.  SLIVOVITZ (slih vuh vits): A potent plum wine, served on holidays. Usually  home made.
