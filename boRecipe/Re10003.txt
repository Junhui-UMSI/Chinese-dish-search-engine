  "Instructions": "Use 8oz glass jars with two part tops, (lids with screw bands), to store  the cooked jams and preserves. Select one or two cup glass or rigid plastic  containers with tight-fitting lids for no cook freezer jams and preserves.  Wash the jars and glasses with screw bands in an automatic dishwasher with  very hot rinse water, keep hot until ready to use or wash with hot, soapy  water and rinse very thoroughly. Place the jars and glasses upside down in  a large saucepot filled with water and bring to boiling and boil for 10  minutes. Keep them hot. Was two-part lids in the automatic dishwasher with  very hot rinse water again, keeping them hot until ready to use or wash in  hot soapy water and rinse well. Place in a small saucepot filled with water  and bring to a boil. Remove them from the water but keep them hot until  ready to use. Fill the jars to within 1/4-inch for the cooked jams and  1/2-inch for the no cook freezer jams. Using a plastic knife or spatula,  make sure there are no air bubbles in the jam. Wipe the jar rims and screw  threads with a clean damp cloth. Cover with the lids, screwing them down  tight, and invert the jars for 5 minutes. then turn upright. Let the jars  stand at room temperature for 1 hour for cooked jams or 24 hours for no  cook jams. Gently stir no cook jams before refrigerating or freezing. ALL  JAMS MUST BE FROZEN OR REFRIGERATED! Store jams in the freezer for up to 1  year.  Thaw frozen jams in the refrigerator.  Thawed jams have a  refrigerator shelf life of 3 weeks.    NOTE:    With the exception of two of the following recipes (the ones without  pectin) they may be processed as canned goods by using the instructions  found in any good cookbook for preserving jellies and jams.",
