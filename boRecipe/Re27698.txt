  "Instructions": "Nothing lifts the spirit or tantalizes more than the fragrance of a  roasting chicken. Caramelized and combined with vegetables and herbs,  nothing comforts more. The trick to cultivating great roast chicken flavor  is in the oven temperature. High initial heat of 450 to 500 degrees is  necessary to caramelize the chickens natural sugars and acids. This is the  basis of that wonderful roast chicken flavor. Cooked at low temperatures,  the chicken becomes poached with far less flavor development. Not only is  chicken cooked this way succulent, but can also be quite healthful. The  white meat or breast meat is the leanest and even if you cook it with the  skin, the fat is negligible once the skin is removed. The skin provides  \"protection\" for the meat and maintains its moistness. Younger chickens are  sold as fryers, while older more mature birds are marketed as roasters.  Fryers usually weigh less than 2 1/2 pounds while roasters are much larger,  weighing in at 3 to 5 pounds. Choose your chicken based on the portions  needed, but keep in mind the younger birds are the most tender. I sometimes  purchase 2 smaller birds instead of 1 large. THE COOKING STEPS: Wash the  chicken inside and out under cold running water. Place in a roasting pan.  Season the bird inside and out with salt and pepper. Stuff herbs such as  thyme, rosemary, parsley and summer savory into the cavity. You may add  other flavor enhancers such as lemons, apples, limes and pears. Before  roasting, rub the skin with a little softened butter or a few drops of  olive oil to create that golden crispy skin. Place the pan on the lower  rack of a preheated 450-500 degree oven. Cook for 15 minutes the turn the  temperature down to 400 degrees for the rest of the cooking time. Cook  until thigh meat reaches 180 degrees, about 35 to 45 minutes for the fryers  and 1 hour or so for the roasters. Remove from oven and allow to rest about       10    minutes. Recipe follows.",
