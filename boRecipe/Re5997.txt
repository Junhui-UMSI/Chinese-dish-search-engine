  "Instructions": "Years ago, a friend taught me a trick for making pita breads inflate. After  you have let the dough rise, punched it down, and shaped it into individual  pitas (rolled thin), you place the pitas on a clean kitchen towel to sit  for 30 minutes (covered with another towel).  Then you place them on an  ungreased cookie sheet *UPSIDE*DOWN* to bake.  Something about turning them  upside down immediately before putting them in the oven helps them to puff  up.  Bake at 500 degrees F (or as hot as your oven will go) until they are  puffed--less than 5 minutes.  Unlike Jenkas husband, I dont like them  crispy but soft so that you can fill them with sandwich fillings. I, too,  think you can use any plain bread recipe, but Ill be glad to post the one  I use if anyone wants it.  Last time I made pita, I adjusted the ingredient  amounts so that I could use the bread cycle of my bread machine. I couldnt  believe how much easier that made the process, as I could have the dough  all ready for me to shape when I got home from work.
