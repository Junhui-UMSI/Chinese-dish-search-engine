  "Instructions": "Place the base of the sleigh on a waxed paper covered work surface.  Position the sides, back, and kick board, holding them in place with  inverted glass measuring cups and inverted custard cups or canned goods.  NOTE that the sides, back and kick board angle out from the base.) When  pieces are correctly positioned use Royal frosting in a decorating bag  fitted with a #16 or #17 star tip to cement the pieces in place. When  frosting is partially dry, add additional rows of frosting inside the  slight to reinforce the seams.  Cement the seat in place with frosting. Let  sleigh dry at least 2 hours.    While the sleigh is drying, assemble the runners.  With a sawing motion,  cut the curved end of each 8-3/4 inch long cane at center of curve. (Candy  canes and sticks cut more easily while still wrapped.) Place a large red  gumdrop on the cut end of each.  Set canes aside.    Cut four of the 3-1/2 inch long candy sticks in half on angles. Position  four of the pieces in a shallow W-shape against each remaining 3-1/2 inch  stick with cut ends against the stick.  Cement with dollops of frosting.  Cement two green square hard candies where the short pieces join each 3-1/2  inch stick.    ================== 3-1/2 inch stick, whole /\\ /\\ 3-1/2 inch sticks cut in  half Gum Drop = / \\ / \\ \\================== 8-3/4 inch cane with end  shortened    *The little square candies are both inside and out at the top of the  inverted v of the runner supports.
