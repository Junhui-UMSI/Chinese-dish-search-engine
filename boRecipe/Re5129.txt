  "Instructions": "Mound flour on kneading board and make hole in center. Drop eggs into hole  and cut into flour with a knife. Add salt and water and knead until firm.  Let rest for 10 minutes covered with a warm bowl. Divide dough in halves  and roll thin. Cut circles with a large biscuit cutter. Place a small mound  of filling a little to one side on each round of dough. Moisten edge with a  little water, fold over and press edges firmly together. Be sure they are  well sealed to prevent the filling from running out. Drop the pierogi into  salted boiling water. Cook gently for for 3 to 5 minutes. Lift out of water  carefully with a perforated spoon. The dough has a tendency to dry while  you are working. A dry dough will not seal completely. We suggest rolling  out a large circle of dough, placing small mounds of filling far enough  apart to allow for cutting, and folding the dough over the mounds of  filling. Then cut with a small biscuit cutter and seal firmly. Never crowd  or pile pierogi. The uncooked will stick and the cooked will lose shape and  lightness. Note: Pierogi can be frozen after boiling and they keep well. I  perfer all my pierogi fried in butter and onions and seasoned with salt and  pepper. They should be fried on a medium low heat till golden brown.  VARIETIES OF FILLING CHEESE: 1 cup cottage cheese 1 tsp. melted butter 1  egg beaten 3 tbsp sugar 3 tbsp currants 1/4 tsp cinnamon cream cheese with  melted butter.
