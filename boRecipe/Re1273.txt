  "Instructions": "1. Using a 3 to 3 1/4 pound roasting chicken, remove the wings at the  second joint and reserve. Lift up the skin of the neck to expose the flesh  and, using the point of a small knife, follow the contour of the wishbone  to get it loose.    2. Pull the wishbone out.    3. Place the chicken on its breast, and cut down the backbone to expose the  meat.    4. Following the carcass with your knife, begin cutting the meat from the  bone. Cut the joint at the shoulder. Cut on top and around the breastbone  and on the other side. This is not really complicated; you simply separate  the meat from the bone as you go. Do not worry about the leg, shoulder, and  wing bones.    5. Remove the carcass in one piece.    6. Cut around the bone of the thigh to free it of meat. Holding the tip in  one hand, scrape with your knife, \"pushing\" the meat from the bone.  Separate the thighbone at the joint between the thigh and drumstick. The  drumstick bone is left in.    7. With a large knife, cut the tip of the drumstick and...    8. \"push\" the flesh back to expose the bone.    9. Cut the tip of the wing bones.    10. You will notice that there are 2 fillets loose on the breast. Pull them  off and position them lower than the breast, where there is no meat on the  skin. Most of the surface should be lined with meat.    Recipe by: La Technique by Jacques Pepin    Posted to bbq-digest by PhantomBBQ@aol.com on Sep 8, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.",
