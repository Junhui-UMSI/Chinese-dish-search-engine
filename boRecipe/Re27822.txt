  "Instructions": "Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:  :15 CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: 1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Wrap the outside of  an 8-inch springform  pan in a double layer of aluminum foil to prevent  seepage.   Butter the pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or waxed  paper.  Butter the paper. 2. Combine the chocolate and butter in a large  metal bowl over a pan of hot - not simmering - water (the bottom of the  bowl should not touch the water). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until  the chocolate is smooth and melted. Or melt in a glass bowl in a microwave  oven on high (100%), stopping and stirring every 15 seconds; remove the  chocolate when there are still a few lumps and stir until completely  smooth. 3. Put the eggs in a large mixer bowl set over simmering water and  stir constantly until warm to the touch, about 3 minutes; remove from the  heat.  With an electric mixer, beat the eggs until they triple in volume  and form soft peaks when the beater is lifted, 5 to 8 minutes. (To ensure  maximum volume, if using a hand-held mixer, continue to beat the eggs over  simmering water until they are hot to the touch, about 5 minutes, then  remove from the heat and beat until cool.) 4. Fold half the eggs into the  melted chocolate until partially incorporated. Add the remaining eggs and  fold until they are just blended and no streaks remain. 5. Pour at once  into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.  Place in a larger roasting pan and add enough hot water to the pan to reach  about two-thirds of the way up the springform. 6. Bake for 5 minutes. Cover  the top of the springform loosely with lightly buttered aluminum foil and  bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool on a  rack for 45 minutes; then cover and refrigerate until chilled and very  firm, about 3 hours. 7. To unmold, run a small spatula or a blunt knife  around the edge and remove the side of the springform. Carefully invert the  cake into a plate that has been covered with plastic wrap and remove the  bottom of the springform; peel off the parchment. Reinvert the cake onto a  cardboard round or a cake plate. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or  overnight, until thoroughly chilled, before serving. 8. If you want to  cover the cake with a chocolate ganache glaze, set it on a rack or tuck  strips of waxed paper around the bottom of the cake. Pour the tepid glaze  onto the center of the cake, letting it cascade over the sides. Run a long  metal spatula lightly across the top so that the glaze will not be too  thick.  If necessary, use the spatula to patch any pare spots. Work quickly  before the glaze sets. Prick any air bubbles with a needle or pin.  Carefully remove any strips of waxed paper. Let the glaze stand undisturbed  until set, 2 to 3 hours at room temperature, or 30 minutes in the  refrigerator. CHOCOLATE GANACHE GLAZE: 1. In a small heavy saucepan, scald  the cream.  Remove from the heat and immediately add the chopped chocolate.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes; then stir gently until the chocolate is  fully melted and smooth. Let cool until tepid. 2. Stir the glaze to test  it.  It is ready to use when a small amount mounds just a tiny bit when  dropped from the spoon before disappearing into the mixture. If the glaze  is too thick and the mound remainds on the surface, add warm water (or  liqueur) by the teaspoonful, testing until the consistency is correct. If  for some reason the glaze remains too thin, stir in more finely grated  chocolate, heat until melted and then let cool again. Variations    MINI-MOUSSE CAKE: This cake is perfect for serving 6 to 8. Make the  Ultimate chocolate Mousse Cake, using 1/2 pound chocolate, 4 ounces of  butter and 3 lightly beaten eggs. Bake in a 6-inch springform pan;  temperature and baking remain the same. MOCHA FUDGE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the  Ultimate Chocolate Mousse cake, prefereably using extra-bittersweet  chocolate.
