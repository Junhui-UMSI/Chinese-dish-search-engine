  "Instructions": "Hi all, Heres a S.African 2 cents worth. An old fashioned and rather  different recipe from \"Leipoldts Cape Cookery\" by the late poet, doctor  and and cook C.Louis Leipoldt. First: a bit of explanation of terms.  \"Brinjal\"=Eggplant, \"Blatjang\"=chutney. Dr Leipoldt didnt believe in  weighing down recipes with anything as mundane as measurements. His  explanations assume that you have good \"cooking sense\", as I know you all  do.    This is called \"Aubergine with Pine Kernels\". I quote verbatim.    \"Select your brinjal with care, choosing a moderate-sized one with firm and  thick flesh; peel it thinly and cut it in slices, on which you strew salt.  Let the brinjal lie till most of the water has been extracted, then wipe  the slices and dust them with fine flour which you have previously mixed  with powdered white pepper, ginger and nutmeg. Slice and brown some onions  with fat, lay on them the brinjal slices and strew over them plenty of pine  kernels. Then add enough sherry to cover them and stew with the lid closed  till everything is well blended. A little chilli and blatjang added much  improves it.\" Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #040 by Dave Williams  <dwill@iafrica.com> on Jul 25, 1997",
