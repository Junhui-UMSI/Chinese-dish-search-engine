  "Instructions": "Heres a little something for when you get tired of all that  disgusting smoked salmon...  Had a real treat in the food section  from the SF Chron last Wednesday.  There was a big article on Queen  Ida along with her recipe for gumbo.  She has a cookbook out++how  that escaped me I have no idea. Its called \"Cookin With Queen Ida\".    Once roux has started to color, never leave the stove:  ignore  telephones, doorbells, children and the pets, and keep stirring.  If  a roux burns (it will develop a burned smell and blackened patches),  throw it out and start over.  Roux cant be rushed, its a gradual  process and needs patience. When cooked too rapidly, roux may brown  but it wont develop its characteristic flavor.  When roux is done,  it will smell like well-cooked flour; it may taste and smell slightly  bitter when sampled as is, but this doesnt mean it is burned.    Mix oil and flour in a heavy cast-iron skillet.  Do NOT use a  nonstick-coated pan.  If mixture is not as soft as pancake batter,  add more oil.    Cook over low to medium heat, stirring gently but constantly with a  wooden spoon, scraping roux from bottom and sides of skillet.  If any  lumps develop, whisk with a wire whisk until they break up.  Cook  until the color is almost a mahogany or chile powder red-brown.  This  will take from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on your pan and heat of  your stove.  Be patient.    After the roux is done, remove from heat to cool, but keep stirring  constantly for the first few minutes.  Then stir frequently for 10  minutes longer, since roux will continue to cook from its own heat  for a few minutes.  As the roux cools, some of the oil will float to  the top. Spoon it off.    Turn roux into a container, and store in the refrigerator.  Before  using, skim off any oil that has separated out, and let roux come to  room temperature.    NOTE:  If you do a lot of Creole cooking, you can double or triple the  recipe.  It will take longer to cook, of course.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; August 27 1992.
