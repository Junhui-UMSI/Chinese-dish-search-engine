This isnt cream of garlic soup, but it has a creamy texture.  Ive done  this one and its great.  As Julia says, "Because the garlic is boiled, its  after-effects are at a minimum, and its flavor becomes exquisite, aromatic  and almot undefinable."    From Julia Childs "Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. I":    Drop garlic cloves in boiling water and boil for 30 seconds.  Drain, run  cold water over them and peel.  Place the garlic and the rest of the  ingredients in a 3-quart saucepan and boil slowly for 30 minutes. Correct  seasoning.    3 egg yolks 3 to 4 T. olive oil    Beat the egg yolks with a wire whip in a soup tureen for a minute or until  they are thick and sticky.  Drop by drop beat in the olive oil for making a  mayonnaise.    Rounds of hard-toasted French bread 1 cup of grated Swiss or Parmesan  cheese    Just before serving, beat a ladleful of hot soup into the egg mixture by  droplets.  Gradually strain in the rest, beating and pressing the juice out  of the garlic.  Serve immediately, accompanied by the bread and cheese.
