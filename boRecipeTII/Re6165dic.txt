Pizza dough, Pizza sauce, Ground round, Provolone cheese; or to, Onion, Garlic, Green olive; sliced, 
Crumble ground round and sautee with onion and garlic until brown. Add  olives and pizza sauce and combine well.    Unroll pizza dough. Evenly place cheese over dough, leaving 1/2" border.  Spread meat mixture even over cheese. Working from long side, roll up dough  as in a jelly roll. Place on lightly greased sheet, seam side down and tuck  ends under to secure.    Cook at 425 for 10-15 minutes, or until nicely browned.    Recipe by: Lisa S; Tallahassee    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by shade <liveoak@polaris.net> on Apr 3, 1998
