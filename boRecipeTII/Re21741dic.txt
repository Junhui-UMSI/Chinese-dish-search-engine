modified from the book _Cookwise_ by Shirly O. Corriher (a great book by  the way).    Just what we all need, yet another muffin recipe. I hesitated sending this  because you all probably have tons of muffin recipes but I finally decided  to send it because I think its a real winner. Very popular with everyone  whos tried it. This is a very moist and sweet muffin despite my reducing  the sugar and dried fruit from the original recipe. You could experiment  with reducing it even more it youre watching your weight. I always double  the following recipe and it makes so much I have to mix it in my largest  pot, its too big for my largest bowl. Doubled it makes 6 large muffins, 12  small muffins and 2 even larger muffins filling everything I own which  makes muffins. They freeze very well.    1. Arrange shelf to just below centre of oven and pre-heat oven to 200c /  400f.    2. Combine first seven ingredients (oat bran, flour, milk powder, brown  sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking powder) in a large bowl.    3. Add the next four ingredients (carrot, apple, raisins, orange zest).    4. In a second bowl combine the liquid ingredients (egg replacer, milk,  applesauce, vanilla and pinapple).    5. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir only enough to  just combine. The batter is very wet.    6. Spray non-stick muffin tins with cooking spray. Spoon the mixture into  the muffin tins to fill them about half way.    7. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes.    (Makes about 12 small muffins)  Posted to fatfree digest by cctlg@cc.newcastle.edu.au (Terri Nowak) on May  17, 1998
