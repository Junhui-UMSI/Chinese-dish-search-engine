Takes 20 minutes to prepare for rolling.    Toast nuts: Preheat oven to 350 F. Spread nuts in shallow pan and bake 5-10  minutes.    Pulse apricots and nuts in food processor just until finely chopped. Place  mixture in bowl; stir in sugar, orange zest, and orange juice. Roll mixture  into 1" balls and arrange close together in shallow pan.    Melt chocolate in glass measuring cup in microwave on High for about 1  minute. Drizzle chocolate over tops of candies; or spoon chocolate in  plastic snadwich bag, cut tiny hole in one corner, and pipe chocolate over  candies.    Variation: Instead of chocolate, roll candies in granulated sugar.    Store in airtight container in refrigerator about 1 week.    Per piece: 81 calories, 2 gm fat.
