Carolyns Chicken a la Crock Pot
Roaster Chicken, Lemon, Honey, Orange juice, 
Rinse Chicken well inside and out.  Roll the lemon on a flat top to soften,  and pierce well with a 2 tined fork. Place the lemon in the cavity of the  chicken and place the chicken in the crock pot.    Mix the honey and the orange juice together well and pour over the chicken.  I sometime add a sprinkle of garlic pepper at this point. Not always.    Cook on low until done.  When you take the chicken out of the pot, remove  the lemon very carefully, it will be hot and squeeze the juice over the  chicken.  Yummy!    If you try this recipe I would appreciate feed back on it. Thank you.    Carolyn the Crafty Gourmet    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 09, 98
