Veggie Burgers #1
Flour, Cooked peas, Chopped fresh parsely, Tamari, Onions, Grated carrot, Breadcrumbs, Cooked green lentils, Beaten egg, 
Saute the onion until soft.  Mix all ingrediants except the flour and  leave to cool. Form the mixture into patties and brown in skillet.     This came from _New Recipes for Young Vegetarians_ by Sammy Green. Lentils  take about one hour to cook from dry, but they freeze well, so make a big  bunch of them at once.  This recipe came out kind of crumbly, but that  might have been a fluke, as this was the first time Id made it.  :)     For Vegan, the _Moosewood Cookbook_ by Mollie Katzen has a "Lentil-Walnut  Burger" recipe on page 147.
