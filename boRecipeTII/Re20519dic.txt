From: pasquale@lanl.gov (Gina Pasquale)    Date: 21 Apr 1994 19:04:51 -0400  I have enjoyed this newsgroup immensely.  Ive gotten so many good recipes  from postings that I thought Id post one of my favorites.  This came from  a newspaper many years ago, and I always get compliments when I make it.    Beat eggs until light & fluffy.  Gradually add in sugar, oil & vanilla.  Sift together flour, salt, soda, cinnamon & nutmeg (I dont sift, just  mix); add to first mixture. Stir in apples & walnuts. Place in greased  9x13" pan. Bake in 350 deg. oven for 45 min. or until center springs back  when touched. Allow to cool in pan on a rack for 15 min; spread with Cream  Cheese Frosting (recipe follows).    CREAM CHEESE FROSTING: Beat cream cheese and butter together.  Add vanilla  and beat.  Gradually beat in powdered sugar until smooth.    Note:  Both cake and frosting freeze well.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
