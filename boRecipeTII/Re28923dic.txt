Pomelo looks like a thick-skinned, oversized grapefruit, and it is sweeter  than the normal grapefruit.    PEEL AND SEPARATE pomelo segments. Remove and discard membranes. Gently  flake the flesh. If using grapefruit, drain excess juice. Chill. In large  bowl, combine pomelo and shredded chicken. Mix together the chopped red  chili with fish sauce, sugar and lime juice; toss with chicken mixture.  Arrange on a bed of lettuce, garnish with coriander leaves, peanuts, and 2  teaspoons of the Crisp Fried Shallot Flakes.    CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure they  are all the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan with the  vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly until browned  and crisp, about 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the shallots should be  completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel. Stored in an air-tight  container, the shallots will keep several weeks.
