TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6196    Rinse the chicken, remove any excess fat from around the vent, and pat dry  with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, 1 teaspoon  salt, paprika, and vinegar. Use this mixture to rub all over and inside the  cavity of the chicken. Cover the chicken and let it sit on a platter for 1  hour.    Heat a large castiron skillet over mediumhigh heat and add the olive oil.  Shake the chicken from both ends to drain off the excess vinegar. Using  kitchen tongs and a large wooden spoon to steady the bird, brown it on all  sides in the hot oil. This will take a good 10 to 15 minutes.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large enamel and castiron casserole,  combine the tomatoes, onions, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the black  pepper. Add 1/2 cup water and set the chicken on top of this mixture.    Roast the chicken for 20 minutes per pound, or until the thigh meat is done  through with no trace of pink remaining. Transfer the chicken to a warm  serving platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil, while you tip the  casserole to one side and spoon off the excess fat. Carve the chicken into  serving pieces as desired, and serve with some of the vegetables from the  pan, sprinkled with the parsley.
