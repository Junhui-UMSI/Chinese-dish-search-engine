Cook onions over low heat until soft and translucent.  Add garlic, chili  power, cumin, oregano, and cayenne.  Cook a few minutes while stirring  constantly.  Add vege broth.  Add tomatoes and juice, beer, sugar, salt,  and bay leaf.    Stop here and refrigerate up to two days if you are making this up ahead of  time.  When ready to finish, bring to gentle simmer and continue.    Sprinkle cornmeal over surface slowly while stirring to avoid lumps.  (At  this point, my SO got real excited and said, its chili, look, it looks  just like chili). Add zucchini and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 5  minutes.  (Add TVP here if you are using it)  Add black beans and corn,  simmer 5-15 minutes.    I served over brown rice and provided bowls of hot sauce, FF sour cream,  chopped jalapeno peppers, and chopped onions.  I also had a loaf of wheat  bread and several people ate their chili with that instead of the rice.    Yum yum.  I would imagine its good the next day, maybe next time Ill  double the recipe so that there will be some left over.    From: Redcz@aol.com. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10 Issue 15] Aug. 25, 1994.
