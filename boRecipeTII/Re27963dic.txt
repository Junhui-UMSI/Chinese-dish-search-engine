Add the flour and salt. With the mixer on low, mix  until the dough starts to come together. Increase the speed to medium-high  and mix until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and crawls up  to dough hook. Grease a mixing bowl with the vegetable oil. Place the dough  in the greased bowl and turn once. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and  place in a warm, draft free place until the dough doubles in size about 1  1/2 hours. Turn the dough out onto a baking sheet. Punch the dough down and  press the dough out to form the pan. Sprinkle the dough with kosher salt  and coarse black pepper. Cover the dough and allow to double in size, about  45 minutes. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, salami, Mozzarella  cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic and parsley. Mix well and season with salt  and pepper. Using your fingers make small dimples over the entire dough.  Brush the dough with olive oil. Smear the filling evenly over the dough.  **The filling must be at room temperature to smear evenly. Bake the dough  for 30 to 35 minutes or until the dough is golden brown. Slice the bread  into 8 to 12 pieces.    Yield: 8 to 10 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Mar 10, 1998
