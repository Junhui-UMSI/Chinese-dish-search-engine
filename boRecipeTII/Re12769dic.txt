Yucca Drink
Lemons, halved, Sugar, Limes, halved, Fifth tequila, Crushed ice, Orange, halved, 
I found out about yucca while on a camping trip. I dont know where the  name came from. Heres the recipe:    Squeeze the juice from the fruit into a large jar like the type you make  sun tea in. Toss in the peels. Add the sugar, and fill with crushed ice.  Add the whole fifth of tequila, put the lid on and shake well.    While sitting around the campfire one evening some friends introduced us to  yucca. When the jar gets passed to you, you give it a shake, twist off the  lid and have a gulp. There is a ritual that goes with it. If you dont  shake it first you loose a turn. If you take too small of a drink, you must  drink more until everyone is satisfied that you didnt cheat yourself. If  you take too big of a drink, you have to buy the tequila for the yucca jar  for the next evenings campfire. Kinda like the dumb things we did in  college, but sitting around the campfire kinda brings out a different  person than when youre at home and have to be responsible. Gives you a  chance to loosen up. And it tastes great!  Posted to bbq-digest V5 #061    From: Kurt Lucas <kurtl@navicom.com>    Date: Sat, 11 Jan 1997 05:01:12 -0800
