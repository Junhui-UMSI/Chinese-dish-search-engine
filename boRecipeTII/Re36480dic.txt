I picked up a recipe for Beer-Cheese Bread at my local Publix Supermarket  while shopping for bread making supplies.  The recipe, according to the  recipe card, is courtesy of Cooking Light Magazine.  The bread was a hit  with my family.  It went well with spaghetti and red wine.  Rather than  follow the recipes procedure exactly, I used the dough cycle on Regal my  bread machine and got excellent results.    Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm beer in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Stir in 2 1/4 cups flour and next six ingredients to form a soft dough.    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and  elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a  time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.  Divide dough in half, and  shape each portion into a 6-inch round loaf.  Place loaves 4 inches apart  on a large baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Brush tops of dough with  egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Make 1/8-inch-deep cuts in a  lattice design across tops of loaves.  Let rise in a warm place (85F),  free from drafts, 1 hour and 15 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at  375F for 15 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cool on wire  racks.    Yield: Two loaves, eight servings each (about 119 calories per wedge).
