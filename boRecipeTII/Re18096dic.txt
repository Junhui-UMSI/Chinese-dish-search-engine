I made one serving...adjust to suit family needs.    Halve a bell pepper, remove seeds and parboil about 2-3 minutes. Place  pepper in a pyrex dish that has been sprayed with a little Pam. Mix  remaining ingredients except ketchup and spoon into pepper halves.  Generously pour ketchup on stuffed peppers (non-vegans can also sprinle  with a little FF parmeasan cheese). Cover dish with tin foil and bake at  375 degrees for about 30-40 min. ENJOY!    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #121    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
