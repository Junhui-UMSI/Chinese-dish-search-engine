Stuffed Miniature Squash
Lemon juice, Pepper, Ripe avocados; seed, peeled,, Baby zucchini or baby yellow, Snipped fresh basil <<<or>>>, NORMA WRENN, Garlic salt, 
If baby vegetables are unavailable, use 8 small zucchini and increase the  cooking time to 5 minutes. Cut and scoop out each zucchini as directed,  except cut the squash in half crosswise before filling (to make 4  appetizers per zucchini).    In a saucepan cook baby zucchini and/or sunburst squash, covered, in a  small amount of boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes or till crisp-tender.  Drain; chill squash till cool. For zucchini, cut each in half lengthwise.  With a small spoon, scoop out most of the flesh from each zucchini, leaving  a 1/4-inch-thick shell. For sunburst squash, using a knife or apple corer,  cut around stem. With a spoon, remove stem and hollow out as much of the  flesh as you can, working fromteh hole in the top of the squash (do not  break through the bottom skin).    For filling, in a blender container or food processor bowl combine  avocados, lemon juice, basil, garlic salt, and pepper. Cover; process till  smooth. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip, pipe filling down  the center of the zucchini or sunburst squash cavity. (Or, just spoon  filling in each.) Serve immediately. (The filling darkens upon stand.)
