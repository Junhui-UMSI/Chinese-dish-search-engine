Heat the oil in a saucepan.  Saute the onions, garlic, ginger, salt,  tumeric, cayenne, coriander, cilantro, and garam marsala for about 5  minutes.    Drain the juice from the tomatoes into the sauteed vegetables. Then crush  the tomatoes by hand and add them to the vegetables. Dice the tofu into  1/2-inch cubes and add to the vegetables. Continue to cook for 10 to 15  minutes over low heat.  Then add the peas and cook another 4 minutes. Serve  hot over brown rice.  A coriander coconut chutney (or other chutney) is an  excellent accompaniment.    GARAM MARSALA:  Preheat the oven to 200 F.  Place the ingredients on a  baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes, or until the spices give off an  aroma.  (Some chefs suggest roasting each ingredient separately, since each  gives its characteristic aroma at a different time.)    Separate the cardamom pods from the seeds.  Discard the pods. Crush the  cinnamon.  Combine the cinnamon, cardamom seeds, and other spices until the  mixture is powdery. Store in a sealed jar.
