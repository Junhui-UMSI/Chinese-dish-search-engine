Quail Roasted with Vanilla, Coffee and Spices
Salt, Small bay leaf, Light olive oil, Juniper berries, Black peppercorns, Freshly ground espresso, Sugar, White sesame seed, Coriander seeds, Cloves, 1-inch piece of cinnamon, Bobwhite or other quail, 
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. On a baking sheet arrange in separate piles,  the sesame, peppercorns, coriander, cloves, juniper berries and cinnamon  and toast until the sesame seeds are golden colored (about 25 minutes). In  a mortar and pestle or a hand coffee grinder, finely grind the toasted  spices along with the bay leaf. Add the coffee, salt and sugar and continue  grinding till all is well pulverized.    Lightly rub the spice mixture over the skin of the quails. Cover and  refrigerate for 2 A 3 hours. In a saute pan, heat the oil and cook the  quail for about 5 minutes, browning on all sides. If necessary, do in two  batches and keep quail warm while completing the cooking. Quail should be  cooked medium rare and still be juicy and pink.    Serve two quail per person in a pool of the vanilla scented butter sauce  (recipe follows). Garnish with thinly sliced parsnips which have been  quickly deep fried until crisp and sprigs of mint.
