Bebes Super Stuffed Potatoes
Onion; chopped fine, American cheese; grated, Salt and pepper to taste, Potatoes, (large) evaporated milk, 
Wash and dry potatoes. Wrap in aluminum foil and bake 60 minutes in 400  degree oven or until tender. Remove and allow to cool slightly. With sharp  knife shave off small slice through potato and foil. This will allow a  small hole to scoop out and re-stuff potatoes. Scoop out potatoes  carefully. Mash scooped-out potatoes and whip together with grated cheese  and onion. Add milk only to moisten. Whipping with mixer will make stuffing  fluffy. Add salt and pepper. Stuff into foil-wrapped shells. Garnish tops  with grated cheese and parsley flakes. Bake in a 350 degree oven until  cheese browns. Serve right out of the oven. Serves 6.
