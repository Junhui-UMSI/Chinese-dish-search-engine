Preheat the oven to 325 F. Cut out three 10-inch parchment paper  circles and one 10-inch cardboard circle.  Set the parchment circles on  baking sheets.         Beat egg whites to soft peaks and gradually add 2 1/2 tablespoons  of sugar and continue beating until stiff.  Combine 2 1/2 cups of  powdered sugar and ground almonds; fold into egg whites.         This mixture can now be used to form layers, or designs or  whatever your choose.  Simply spoon mixture into a pastry bag fitted  with the tip of your choice, and pipe your designs onto parchment paper  covered baking sheets.         Dust lightly with powdered sugar (optional.) Then bake the your  meringue until crisp and very lightly golden (for designs about a half  inch thick, it takes 25 to 30 minutes.)         Cool on the finished baked meringue on racks.
