Baby Beet Salad with Oranges and Red Onion
Whole baby beets, Navel oranges, Red onion, Salt and pepper, Extra-virgin olive oil, Mint leaves, 
Place the beets, unpeeled, in a foil-lined baking dish. Cover with more  foil and seal the edges of the top and bottom layers of foil to completely  enclose the beets. Place them in a 400 degree oven and bake for  approximately 20 minutes or until the beets are tender when pierced with a  sharp paring knife.    While the beets are baking peel the oranges. First cut a thin slice from  the top and bottom of the orange so that it can sit firmly on the  countertop. Using a sharp paring knife cut the peel and pith off with  sawing downward strokes so that the orange is completely peeled. Cut the  individual sections out from the membranes. Place in a mixing bowl together  with the onion and mint.    When the beets are tender hold them under running water and slip the skins  off. Trim the stem end, then cut them in half and then into slices. Add the  beet slices to the bowl with the oranges. Season with salt and pepper to  taste than drizzle the orange olive oil over to taste. Toss to mix. Can be  served immediately or allowed to marinate up to 2 days.  NOTES : Insalata di Barbabietole
