Apple Crumb Pie
All-purpose flour, Pie crust, Sugar, Apples, All-purpose flour, Sugar, Ground cinnamon, Butter, 
This is my favorite apple pie. We go apple picking each year at local  orchards. this is one of the first things I make. You need a fairly deep  dish for this one. Recipe comes from Better Homes and Gardens New Cook  Book.    Combine first 3 ingredients; stir into apples. Turn into pie shell. Combine  remaining flour and sugar, cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinklw over  apples. Bake at 400 for 45-50 minutes or until done. If it browns too  quickly, cover edges with foil.
