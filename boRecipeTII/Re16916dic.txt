1. Cut onions into large dice. Clean leeks as follows: cut off root ends;  remove and discard coarse outer leaves; discard green tops. Split  lengthwise, cutting to within 1 inch of root end. Soak in cold water for  several minutes; separate leaves under running water to rinse away any  dirt. Cut leeks into 1/4-inch slices. Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch  cubes.    2. In a large saucepan, heat butter and oil. Add onions, garlic, shallots,  and leeks. Cook slowly over low heat until lightly browned. Add potatoes,  stock, salt to taste, basil, bay leaf, oregano, and marjoram. Bring to a  boil, reduce heat to simmer, and cook 40 minutes. Serve immediately or  refrigerate and warm before serving. Garnish with minced chives.    Makes 6 to 8 servings.
