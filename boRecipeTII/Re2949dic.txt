Spread 3/4 of this mixture on the bottom of the pie shell.  Combine cornstarch, sugar and salt. Add scalded milk and mix well. Cook in  top of double boiler until mixture thickens add butter and vanilla, then  pour into baked pie shell. You can make meringue with the leftover egg  whites, but my family prefers whipped topping. Ssprinkle remaining peanut  butter mixture over topping.
