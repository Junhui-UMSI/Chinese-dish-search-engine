Walnut Bourbon Pie
Light corn syrup, Butter, 9-inch pie crust, unbaked, Vanilla, Eggs, Black walnuts, Granulated sugar, Bourbon, Salt, Whipped cream, Unsweetened baking chocolate, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a medium saucepan, melt chocolate with  sugar, corn syrup, bourbon, butter, vanilla, and salt over low heat. Let  cool; stir in eggs. Place nuts in pie shell (sprinkle evenly over bottom).  Pour chocolate mixture over nuts. Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 325  degrees and bake 35 to 40 minutes longer--the filling will still be a bit  shaky, but deep golden brown. Let cool to room temperature prior to  serving. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #343    From: Diane Lamere <dlamere@plantnet.com>    Date: Fri, 13 Dec 1996 21:59:10 -0800
