Gradually add the sugar, beating until the mixture is very thick.  Beat in the lemon juice and the rind, add the bananas, the matzah cake  meal, the almonds and the salt and beat the mixture until it is combined  well. In a clean dry bowl, with clean dry beater beat the whites until they  just hold stiff peaks, stir 1 cup of them into the banana mixture and fold  in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly, Pour the batter into an  ungreased 9" tube pan (3-1/2" deep) with a removable bottom and bake the  torte in the middle of a preheated 350 oven for 55-60 minutes, or until a  tester comes out clean.    Invert the pan over the neck of a bottle and let the torte cool upside  down. Run a thin knife around the edge and tube of the pan and remove the  side of the pan. Run the knife under the bottom of the torte to release it  and transfer the torte carefully with 2 spatulas to a serving plate.    I hope you enjoy this as much as I have.
