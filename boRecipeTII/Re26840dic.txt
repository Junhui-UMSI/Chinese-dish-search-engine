Baked Bean Casserole #1
Soy breakfast links cut into, Box (small) corn bread mix, Green Pepper, BBQ sauce or ketchup, salt and pepper, Onions, Spicy mustard, Baked beans, Crushed pineapple, 
This is something I like to have in the fall on those cool evenings.  The  measurements are not exact and you can basically add ingredients according  to taste. This version is vegeterian, but can be adapted for a meat eater.     In a casserole dish or large square baking pan, mix all ingredients except  corn bread mix.  Prepare corn bread mix according to package directions.  Pour over the bean mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes.     This will serve 4 as a main dish with a salad.  It will serve 8-10 as a  side dish.  Enjoy!    SAMADM@RITVAX.ISC.RIT.EDU    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
