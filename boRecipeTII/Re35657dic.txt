Stuffed Artichokes in Olive Oil
Sugar, Water, Rice, Fresh green fava beans, Lemons, olive oil, Finely chopped onions, Flour, Salt, Lemon wedges for garnish, Artichokes, Chopped fresh dill, 
Mix juice of 2 lemons & the flour in a large bowl. Add 2 qt water & mix  thoroughly.  Wash artichokes, bend back & snap off outer leaves. Leave only  the tender inner leaves. Slice off these leaves just above the heart &  scoop out the fuzzy choke & remaining pinkish leaves. Cut off the stem &  peel around the base with a vegetable peeler until you reach the whitish  tender part.  As you trim each artichoke, take a lemon half, sprinkle it  with salt & rub it all around & inside the base to prevent discoloration.  Then drop each artichoke into the lemon water mixture.    Remove jackets of fava beans.  Sprinkle beans with salt & let stand for 5  minutes.  Remove skins, rinse & reserve.    Heat 1 c olive oil in skillet.  Add onions, 1/2 ts salt & saute for 5  minutes.  Stir in fava beans & rice. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring, & add  1/2 c water. Cover & cook for 5 minutes till the water has been absorbed.  Stir in the dill, salt & remove from heat. Let stand covered for 15  minutes.    Remove artichokes from water bath.  Reserve 4 1/2 c liquid. Stuff centre  cavity of artichokes with the rice. Place each one on a sheet of wax paper,  sprinkle with a little water & wrap as you would a package. Arrange them  stem sides down in a heavy shallow pan. Add 1 1/2 c reserved liquid, 1/4 c  olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon & sugar. Cover & cook over medium heat for 10  minutes.  Reduce heat to low & simmer for 1 hour. The liquid will be  continually absorbed so add more as needed. When the artichokes are tender,  let them cool,  Unwrap them & arrange them on a serving platter. Serve cold  with garnish as part of a buffet.    Ayla Esen Algar, "The Complete Book of Turkish Cooking"
