Heat lard in heavy 10-inch  skillet; add tomato puree (hm, I noticed this recipe neglected to list the  amount. Id say try 1/8 to 1/2 cup). Cook over high heat about 10 minutes  or until reduced, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat. Gradually stir in  sesame seed mixture. Do not boil. Add turkey; continue cooking over low  heat 5 to 10 minutes or until mixture is thick. Makes about 2 1/2 cups.    Note: To use fresh tomatillos, remove papery husks; rinse.
