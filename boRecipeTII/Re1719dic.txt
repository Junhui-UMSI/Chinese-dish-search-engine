This recipe comes from my "Byerlys Collection", recipe cards handed out at  the Twin Cities premier upscale grocery store, and is billed as "an English  recipe from Quebec".    Melt butter in large heavy saucepan. Add onion and carrot, cover and cook  over low heat about 5 minutes. Blend in four, mustard, and paprika. Stir in  cheese and 1 can broth until cheese is melted. Add remaining ingredients;  simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Makes 7 cups. Garnish bowls of soup with popcorn, minced chives, chopped  parsley, or crumbled bacon.
