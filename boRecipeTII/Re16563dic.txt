Aggression Cookies -- (the post-modern Asian American performance poem)    NOTE: With thick Chinese meat cleaver, hack chocolate and macadamia nuts to  pieces. ALSO, You may substitute chocolate and white chocolate chips for  the bars if you are not feeling particularly angst-ridden.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, thrash butter and sugars  until uniform. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Add flour and baking soda; whip  until smooth. Toss in chocolate chunks and nuts. To avoid the "chocolate  chip cookie cooked under a steam roller" look, refrigerate the cookie dough  for a couple of hours before baking.    Throw batter by tablespoons full onto an ungreased baking sheet--aim so  that the cookies land 2 inches apart. Bake until golden, about 10-12  minutes. Using a spatula, pry the cookies loose from the baking sheet, and  allow them to vent on wire racks. Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
