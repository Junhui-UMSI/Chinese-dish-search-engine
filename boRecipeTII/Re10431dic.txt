Quick Cooked Spinach (Horenso O-Hitashi)
Soy sauce, Water, Spinach, fresh, Salt, Scallion, 
O-hitashi is a technique in which water flavored with vinegar or onions is  used to blanch vegetables.  The reserved water makes for a flavorful soup  stock.    Bring the water to a rolling boil.  Add salt and onion.  when the color of  the onion darkens slightly, remove from heat and strain, reserving hot  water.  Discard onion and return water to a boil.    Repeat step #1 with spinach, cooking it only for a few seconds.  After  straining, run the spinach under cold water.  Drain, then roll the leaves  into a 2" thick log.  Squeeze gently to remove excess water.    Dampen a sharp knife with a cloth and slice log into 1" pieces.  Drizzle  with soy sauce immediately before serving.    Makes 12 pieces.
