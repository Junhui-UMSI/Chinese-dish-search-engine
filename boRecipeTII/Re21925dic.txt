Apples with Lemon Juice and Cinnamon
Apple, Cinnamon, Lemon juice, 
Core and slice apple into 8 wedges, and arrange in a small bowl.  Pour  lemon juice over the apple wedges, and sprinkle cinnamon on top.

Its  really yummy, though, especially if you like things a bit tart.    * The Polka Dot Palace - The BBS for Homemakers!  1-201-822-3627 * Posted  by LISA on 08-03-95    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #708 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
