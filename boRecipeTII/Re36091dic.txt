Place in the crock  pot. Add an onion, cut in about 6-8 pieces. Add spices (we dont use salt -  we add Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb, plus some additional garlic and pepper).  Cover with water.    Sometimes I add a dash of beef boullion granules. Set on high. I let this  simmer away for about 5 - 6 hours. We usually add potatoes (quartered) the  last 60-80 minutes. Other root veggies work great too.    Now, for the DOUBLE DUTY: For the leftovers, I slice the roast somewhat  thin, and breakup up the slices (sort of shred it), put it in a sauce pan  and add barbecue sauce and a little water. I let this simmer for about 20  minutes, stirring occasionally. If it gets too dry add more sauce or water.  Serve on rolls. This is great to take for lunch and heat in the microwave  at work.    Note: Be sure to select a roast or two that will fit it the crock pot! (My  first one didnt!)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /MISC    From rec.food.cooking archives.
