Meanwhile, in a  large roasting pan, combine the soy sauce, coffee, bay leaves, garlic,  oregano, and one of the sliced onions. Transfer the browned meat to the  roasting pan. Top with the second sliced onion. Cover and bake for 3 1/2 to  4 hours, basting every hour with pan juices. If the liquid begins to boil  away (this depends on the heaviness of your pan), add another cup of coffee  and a liberal splash of soy sauce.
