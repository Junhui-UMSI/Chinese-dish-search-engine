Avocado Soup
Salt and pepper to taste, Table cream, Sour cream, Paprika, Chicken consomme, Ground ginger, avocados, 
Peel & dice avocados.  Combine in blender with onion juice, consomme or  broth, sour cream and table cream. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with  salt, pepper and ginger. Store in covered, opaque container in refrigerator  until chilled and ready to serve. Top with additional sour cream if you  like and sprinkle with paprika. Note: plain yogurt can be substituted for  the sour cream for a somewhat more healthful dish. Be sure to pour off any  excess water in the yogurt before adding to other ingredients.
