Since I got this recipe when my children were small I  usually used elbow macaroni, its easier to eat.    Combine ingredients in order given. Simmer while preparing meatballs. When  meatballs are brown place in sauce and simmere 30 minutes. For variation,  long precooked spaghetti may be added after meatballs are done.
