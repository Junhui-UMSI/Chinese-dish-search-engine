Egg Salad
Dill, Mayonnaise; approx., Eggs, Pepper, Salt, Onions; diced, Oil; approx., Mushroom Pieces; drained, Salt, 
Place eggs in a pot of cold water with 1 tsp. salt and boil them till they  are hard-boiled.    Onions can be diced in the food processor and later the mushrooms too.  Place onions in a pan and cook on low for one minute to remove the bitter  taste. Add pepper. Then pour oil on them and stir. After a few minutes, add  diced mushroom pieces. Fry all together.    Peel hard-boiled eggs under cold water. Chop eggs, fried onion mixture,  salt, mayonnaise and dill together. The texture should be a fine spread.    NOTES : Polish recipe.
