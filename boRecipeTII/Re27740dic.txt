The Omelette (Mf)
Salt and pepper, Eggs, Unsalted butter, dill, swiss cheese, 
Beat the eggs with a fork; season with a pinch of salt and pepper add any  fresh herbs you would like to include    Melt the butter in an omelet pan or a nonstick 7inch pan with sloping  sides. Tilt the pan from side to side to coat the bottom with melted  butter. When butter is about to turn brown, add the eggs to the skillet.  Over high heat, stir the eggs with your right hand while you shake the pan  back and forth, up and down, with your left hand. When the underside of the  omelet begins to set, tilt to pan, after you lift the edge of omelet, so  that any uncooked egg from the top will run under the cooked egg and set.  Run a line of the grated cheese down the middle of the omelet    Hold the right top or side third of the omelet towards the center, then  roll it over onto other third.    Grab the handle of the omelet pan with your right hand, and roll the  omelette onto a plate.
