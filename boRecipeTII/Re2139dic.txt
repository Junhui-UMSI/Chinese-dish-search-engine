Appley Apple Cake
Flour, Vanilla, Nutmeg, Egg Whites or 4 egg, Chopped Gala Apples, Salt or 1 Tablespoon Molly, Sugar, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, 
This makes a very moist cake like dessert. Use apples which do not "sauce"  when cooking like Gala apples. Cut the recipe in half to bake in 1 round  cake pan.    Mix all ingredients except apples. Stir in apples. Bake in non-stick 9x13  pan at 350 degrees for about 60 minutes or until done. Hubby likes his with  about 1 Tablespoon finely chopped walnuts or pecans sprinkeled on the top  before baking.    Posted to fatfree digest by Barb Beck <barb@owlnut.rr.ualberta.ca> on Oct  8, 1998,
