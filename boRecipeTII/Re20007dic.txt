Valentine Meringue Hearts
Vanilla extract, Salt, Strawberries, Sugar, Cream of tartar, Red food coloring, Vanilla ice cream, Egg whites, 
Cut a heart pattern from a 4-1/2 inch square of paper. Cover baking sheet  with brown paper. (You can bake on the brown paper so make sure it is  clean.) Grocery store bags without writing on them are okay. Draw 6 hearts  on the brown paper using your pattern as a guide.    1. Beat egg whites with vanilla, cream of tartar and salt until frothy. Add  sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until stiff peaks form and  sugar is dissolved. Rub a bit between your figures to feel that no sugar  remains undissolved. Add food coloring, a few drops to make a delicate pink  color. 2. Spread meringue over the heart shapes, 1/4 inch thick. Make into  the heart shape using a spoon to push and form into correct shape. Pipe rim  3/4 inch high with pastry tube. 3. Bake in preheated 275-degree oven for 1  hour. Turn off oven and let meringues dry in oven for 1 more hour. DO NOT  open oven door during this time. 4. Fill the cooled meringues with scoops  of ice cream and top with strawberries. Decorate with mint leaves if  desired.
