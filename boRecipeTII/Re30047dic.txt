Balsamic Beef Tenderloin
Mushrooms, Balsamic vinegar, Fresh Garlic, salt and pepper, olive oil, Beef Tenderloin, 
Season entire surface of tenderloin with salt and pepper. Heat oil and  garlic in oven-proof skillet or flame-proof shallow roasting pan over  medium-high heat. Add meat, turning to brown all sides. Place in a 425  degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until internal temperatures reaches 145  degrees for medium-rare. Remove from oven. Place meat on cutting board and  cover with foil. Place pan over high heat; add vinegar and stir to remove  browned bits from pan. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until reduced by half.  Add mushrooms; cook for 2 minutes or until mushrooms are tender.    Cut meat into 1/2-inch thick slices. Spoon mushrooms and sauce over each  serving.    NOTES : Start with melt-in-your-mouth medallions of beef tenderloin.  Then  pair them with the sweet, yet robust flavor of this classic, dark Italian  vinegar, fresh mushrooms, and of course, garlic!  Its wonderful!
