Place the lid on  the can and place that can into a 3 pound coffee can with a tight fitting  lid. Pack the larger can with ice and pour at least 3/4 cup rock salt over  the ice. Place the lid on the 3 pound can. Give it to the kids and they can  roll it back and forth for 10 minutes. Open the outer can. Remove the inner  can and scrape down the sides. Replace the lid, fill with ice again, and  roll 5 minutes more. Makes 3 cups of ice cream.    EAT-L DIGEST 21 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
