Winner Jeanette McCarthy, Downers Grove, Illinois, describes her  impatient persons "Im hungry" cookies: "When I was a child, part of our  Christmas celebration involved visits to my fathers relatives during the  time between Christmas and Epiphany. Great-Aunt Elizabeth came from a  family whose women had been cooks for a wealthy family in Hungary. As a  result, her cooking was usually slightly different and somewhat elegant.      "A treasured memory of Christmas at Great-Aunt Elizabeths house was a  cookie that I never learned to eat in moderation. Although my mother warned  me not to say anything, one of the first things I would say upon arrival  was, Im hungry, hoping that these cookies would appear. Much to my  delight they usually did, and in fact, began also to appear at Easter, the  Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and any other time we got together to  celebrate." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie  Contest December 4, 1986  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000
