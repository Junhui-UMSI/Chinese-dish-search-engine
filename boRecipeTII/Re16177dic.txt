In  cold water, place crushed dark crystal malt in a cheesecloth.  Bring  water  to boil. When boiling commences, remove grain and add  Telfords.  Boil  15-20  minutes. Add sugar and honey and boil another  10  minutes.  Reduce  heat so that boiling stops. Add cinnamon and sliced  apples  and  steep  15  minutes.  Remove apples with strainer and  transfer  wort  to  primary. This beer has a medium body with a hint of apple flavor. It is  very smooth with little or no bitterness, but that can be changed by adding  finishing hops.
