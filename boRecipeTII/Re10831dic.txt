1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Prick the eggplants in several spots  with a fork. Roast the eggplants on a nonstick baking sheet for 40 minutes,  or until soft. Let eggplants cool.    2. Heat the olive oil in a nonstick frying pan. Add the onion and cook over  medium heat until soft but not brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the Quinoa  and lightly toast it for 1 minute. Stir in 2 cups water and salt to taste  and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and gently simmer the  Quinoa for 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 10  minutes. Uncover the pan and fluff the Quinoa with a fork. Transfer the  Quinoa to a mixing bowl and let cool.    3. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise. Scrape out the flesh, taking care  not to pierce the eggplant skin, and place it in a food processor with the  garlic, cilantro, parsley, soy sauce, and lemon juice. Puree to a smooth  paste. Stir the eggplant mixture into the Quinoa. Correct the seasoning,  adding soy sauce, pepper, or lemon juice to taste. Spoon the caviar back  into the eggplant skin and serve it with toast points, Bruschetta, or pita  chips, or on boiled new potatoes with no fat sour cream.

That set me thinking about Russias  eggplant caviar, and I decided to combine the two.  Soy sauce gives it a  briny quality,, while the cilantro hints at the iodine thing of sturgeon  roe.
