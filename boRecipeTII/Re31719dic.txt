Swordfish Marinated in Lemon, Rosemary and Garlic
Garlic, Capers, fresh rosemary, lemon zest, Swordfish steaks, Salt, Lemon wedges, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, 
Combine the lemon zest, oil, rosemary and garlic on a large, shallow  platter or a tray large enough to hold the swordfish steaks in a single  layer. Add the swordfish, sprinkle with salt and pepper and turn to coat  with the marinade. Cover and marinade in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.    Brush the grill or broiler pan with a thin film of oil. Just before serving  time, preheat the grill or broiler. Transfer the swordfish to grill or  broiler pan, reserve the marinade left on the platter. If    broiling, adjust the oven rack so that the tops of the fish are about 3  inches from the heat source. Grill or broil until lightly browned, 5 to 8  minutes, depending on the intensity of the heat. Using a spatula, carefully  turn each steak. Spoon any marinade and pieces of lemon zest and rosemary  on to the tops of the steaks. Broil until lightly browned and the center of  the fish is opaque when tested with the tip of a knife, about 5 to 8  minutes. Serve garnished with capers and lemon wedges.
