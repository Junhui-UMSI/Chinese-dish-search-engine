Periyalis Almond Skordalia Potato, Almond and Garlic Dip
Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon juice, White-wine vinegar, (about 5 slices) firm, Whole blanched almonds,, Salt, (about 3 ounces) all-purpose, Sugar, Bread, Garlic cloves, put through a, 
Trim the crusts from the bread and spread the slices out on a tray to dry  for about 24 hours.    In the container of a food processor, place the almonds, garlic, and cooled  potato. Process until smooth.    Mix the lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and sugar in a small bowl  and set aside. Fill a large bowl with cool water. Drop the dried bread into  the water, 1 slice at a time. When it is soaked, squeeze about half the  water from the bread between the palms of your hands. Add the bread to the  ingredients in the processor, alternating with the lemon-juice mixture, and  process until smooth. Since the skordalia has a tendency to stiffen and  become pasty as it chills, the mixture should be quite loose at this point.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Scrape the mixture into a bowl. Cover and  refrigerate for several hours to allow the flavors to mellow and blend. If  the mixture seems too stiff, beat in a little water before serving.
