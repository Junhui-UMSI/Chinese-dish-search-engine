Ive been lurking on this list for a few weeks and decided that some of  you may enjoy this sauce. It is good on grilled chicken breasts. It is not  immediately and overwhelmingly hot but has a real nice afterburn. It was  developed by Chef Mickey Donald at Aunt Chiladas Restaurant at Squaw Peak  in Phoenix. BTW, if you are ever in Phoenix, the restaurant you want to  eat at is Los Dos Molinos on South Central.    Karen <karenwe@indirect.com>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
