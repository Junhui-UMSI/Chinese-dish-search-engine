Potato Pancakes W/applesauce
onion, Eggs, Applesauce, Baking potatoes, Flour, Salt, Bacon fat, 
Peel potatoes, drop into cold water. In large mixing bowl, beat eggs enough  to break them up; add onion & gradually beat in flour & salt. Pat potatoes  dry one at a time & grate coarsely into sieve or colander. Press each  potato firmly into sieve to squeeze out water; stir into egg & onion batter  immediately. Preheat oven to 250. In heavy 8-10 inch skillet, melt 8 Tbs  bacon fat over high heat until it splutters. Pour in 1/2 cup of potato  mixture; with large spatula, flatten into pancake about 5-inch in diameter.  Fry over medium heat 2 minutes on each side. When golden brown on each side  & edges crispy, transfer to heated plate & keep warm in oven. Continue  making pancakes, add more fat if necessary to keep depth of 1/4 inch. Serve  as soon as possible with applesauce or ligonberry preserves.
