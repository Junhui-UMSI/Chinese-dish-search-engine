Tante Maries Lemon Pudding
Crumbled bread; without, Hot water, Grated zest and juice of 2, Butter; diced, Sugar, Eggs; well-beaten, 
Mix all the ingredients together, place in a 1-quart baking dish, and bake  in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 30 minutes. Serve warm  with lightly whipped cream or fresh blueberry sauce.    Serves 4-6.    NOTE: Sometimes I serve the lemon pudding on top of blueberry sauce. To  make the sauce, simply cook 4 cups blueberries with 1 cup sugar for 10  minutes.
