Basic Hard Candy Recipe
Sugar, Water, Coloring, Light corn syrup, Oil flavoring, 
From: WrdsmithME@aol.com    Date: 29 Mar 1995 03:39:59 -0700  Heres a hard candy recipe thats published in a leaflet, "Guide to Hard  Candy Making," by Apollo Mold Company.  Its pretty good, though you have  to be careful to use enough coloring and flavoring!    In a saucepan, blend sugar, corn syrup, and water.  Bring to a boil over  high heat until mixture reaches 290 degrees Fahrenheit.  Stir frequently  with a metal (not wood) spoon. Remove pan from heat. Allow to stand until  bubbles have simmered down. Add flavoring and color, as desired. Too much  stirring will cause the syrup to solidify into a hard sugary lump. Mold  into desired shapes in Apollo Hard Candy Molds sprayed lightly with a  nonstick vegetable oil spray. Work fast. If mixture becomes too cold and  thick, it may be warmed for a few seconds in a microwave.    When hard candies are completely cooled, store them in airtight containers  or place them, individually, in 3- by 5-inch plastic sucker bags.
