Yorkshire Gingerbread
Ground ginger, Baking soda, Self-rising flour, Ground allspice, Salt, Dark molasses, brown sugar, Eggs, Unsalted butter, 
Sift the flour, ginger, allspice, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl.  In another bowl, cream the butter and brown sugar until very soft. Beat in  the eggs one by one, then mix in the treacle. Gently fold in the sifted dry  ingredients.    Pour the mixture into a greased and lined 8 inch square, deep cake tin and  bake in a preheated oven on 325 degrees F for 50 to 60 minutes, or until  the top springs back when pressed.    Cool in the tin, remove and store for a few days in an airtight tin before  eating. The cake can be served in slices spread with butter, or with  clotted cream and stem ginger.    Note: 1. The Molasses needs to be dark and rich, like blackstrap or  Grandmas Brand. They call that dark treacle in England.    2. On the show they only said to use one teaspoon of baking soda  (Bicarbonate of soda), but the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon. I used the  tablespoon and it came out all right.    3. A friend from Manchester, England said that this was as good as anything  you can get in the bakeries there.
