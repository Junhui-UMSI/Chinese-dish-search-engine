Here is mine from my Simply Delicious Cooking 2 cookbook, why not visit my  site www.divinecuisine.com, thanks. Chef K.    In a food processor, place the small shrimp, pork, green onions, soya  sauce, garlic, spice and salt. Process for 1 minute.    Place a small amount of the mixture on a won ton wrapper. Brush with water,  fold over into a triangle. Pull the three corners together and press to  seal. Repeat until all mixture is used.    Place the broth into a large pot and bring to a boil. Add the won tons and  cook for 6 minutes.    Add the remaining ingredients and cook for an additional 6 minutes. Serve  at once.
