Vevas Round Steak (Salt-Fried)
Milk, round steak, Drippings, Flour, salt and pepper, Salt, Fat, Kitchen Bouquet, GRAVY, 
So Im sending along some of favorite foods my Mom used to fix in the 40s  and 50s. Her name is Veva.    Take a 1/2 inch thick tenderized round steak (In those days we tenderized  it by beating flour into it with the side of a saucer). Cut into serving  size pieces. Set iron skillet on top of stove at highest heat. When it is  hot (check by dropping a few drops water on it and they will bounce)  sprinkle the bottom of the pan with salt and quickly add the meat. Sear  well. Turn and sear other side. Serve immediately after you make gravy from  the drippings.    GRAVY: Pour all the fat off except about 2 Tbs. Stir in about 2-3 Tbs.  flour and scrape up all the drippings off the bottom of the skillet. Stir  and eat to a paste. Then slowly add milk, stirring vigorously with a fork  (about 2 cups-may need to add some more flour mixed first with some milk to  dissolve to make it to the thickness you want). Stir until it bubbles  nicely and is thickened as desired. Today I add about 1 tsp. Kitchen  Bouquet to flavor it. Also add some salt and pepper to taste and serve over  the meat. Mashed potatoes go along with this nicely.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #209 by "William & Evelyn Hall"  <wchall@nevia.net> on Aug 30, 1997
