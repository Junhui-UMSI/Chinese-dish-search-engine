Boil for 15 minutes. Remove all cloves from  pickling spice or as many as possible. Wrap remaing spice in cheese cloth  or tea holder and hang in vinegar mixture. Break off ends of asparagus and  blanch for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes. Then plunge into ice water. Place in each  jar 1 clove garlic and one hot chile pepper. Pack asparagus in jars  standing on end, then pour brine into jars, making sure it is very hot at  time to insure a good seal on jars. Store in pantry to 2-1/2 to 3 months  before opening jars. Makes 4 quarts.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #63    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
