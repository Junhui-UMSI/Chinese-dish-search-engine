1.  Put eggs and vanilla in a bowl.  Beat in sugar and salt just until  mixed?no more.  Stir in milk.  (Its scalded when bubbles form around  the edge of pan.)    2.  Pour through a sieve into eight 5-ounce custard cups-no buttering  needed.  Sprinkle lightly with nutmeg, then place cups, not touching,  in shallow baking pan.    3.  Pull out oven shelf a little and set pan on it for easy handling.  Pour boiling water from kettle into the pan to make a depth of about        1    inch around the cups.    4.  Let them bake lazily in a slow over (325?) 30 minutes or until  centers are almost set but still soft.  (Do not over bake: custards  will set as the cool.)  Lift cups from water; cool.    Makes 8 5-oz. custard cups.    Source: Family Circle Illustrated Library of Cooking    Typed for you by Lois Flack, CYBEREALM BBS, Watertown, NY.
