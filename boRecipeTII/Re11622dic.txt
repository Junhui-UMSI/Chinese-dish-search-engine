Mix so that  the raspberries become a paste, this will happen as the mixture heats. It  should be ready when the sauce begins to boil.  You may also want to strain  the sauce to get rid of the raspberry seeds.  Great over ice-cream or cake.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.
