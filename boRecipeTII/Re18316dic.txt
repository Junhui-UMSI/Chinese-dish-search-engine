Vermicelli with Clams
A handful of parsley, Vermicelli (very thin, Small clams, Clove of garlic, olive oil, Salt and pepper, 
Leave the clams under cold running water for about an hour to remove any  sand. Brush the shells well, and put the clams into a pan over moderate  heat until they open. Remove the clams from their shells over a strainer so  you don?t lose their liquid.    Finely chop the parsley and garlic and gently saute it in olive oil. Season  with salt and pepper and add the clam liquid. Cook for a few minutes. Then  add the clams and the cooked and drained vermicelli. Let everything cook  together for a few minutes and serve.
