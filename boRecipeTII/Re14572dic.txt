Stir-fry the minced meat in the wok for 8-12 minutes. Strain off and save  the liquid. Set the meat aside.    Add the oil to the wok and stir-fry the garlic very quickly: then add  onion, reduce heat and stir-fry for 10 minutes, until translucent. Add  Balti paste and garam masala (if youre using it). Raise heat again and  stir-fry for another few minutes.  Then add the mince to the mixture in the  wok and continue stir-frying a few minutes more.    Lower heat and simmer uncovered for 35-40 minutes. Every now and then, add  some of the reserved liquid to help keep the mixture from sticking. When  cooked, add coriander leaves to taste. Serve.
