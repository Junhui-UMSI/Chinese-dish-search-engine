Sweet Orange Bread
Orange juice, Salt, Orange juice concentrate;, water, flour, Orange Peel, Sugar, Powdered sugar, Dry milk, Butter or margarine, Eggs, Glaze:, 
Notes: 1/2 egg equals about 2 tablespoons slightly beaten egg. The recipe  is published by Gold Medal and so specifies their Better for Bread flour.  You could also use 3 cups of unbleached flour and replace 1 1/2 tablespoons  of it with 1 1/2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten. The recipe as written  specifies Fleischmanns Bread Machine Yeast; I have personally had  consistently better results with Red Star regular active dry yeast; the  standard measure is 2 teaspoons per 1 1/2 lb loaf.    Place all ingredients (except glaze, of course) in the bread machine in the  order recommended by the manufacturer.  Select a Basic/White dough or a  Sweet Dough cycle. Use a light or medium crust setting. Push start.    Remove baked bread from pan and cool on a wire rack.  When completely  cooled, drizzle with glaze, if desired.    The use of a delay cycle is not recommended for this recipe because it  contains perishable ingredients.    Makes 1 1/2 lb loaf.
