STUFFING MIXTURE, Vinegar, Celery Seeds, Onion, Dry mustard, COOKING LIQUID, Vinegar, Eggs, Cloves, Onion, Red Pepper, Sugar, Brown sugar, Cayenne pepper, Black Peppercorns, Bread crumbs, 
To cook old ham ("Country Cured"--Smithfield, etc.): Soak in cold water  overnight, skin side down. Change water next morning. Put on in cold water  to cover, skin side up. Add Cooking liquid as above. Cover and boil for 20  min. per pound. Mix all ingreds. for stuffing and set aside. Remove bone  and skin from cooked ham. Put stuffing in place of bone and sprinkle top of  ham with sugar. Pour 1/2 c. vinegar in bottom of pan and bake 1 hr. at 325  F.    Serves 15 to 30 depending on size of ham.    NOTE: This recipe was originally intended for uncooked country style cured  hams. If you wish to save some time, use a good quality fully-cooked ham  (NOT a boneless ham). Another tip is when removing the bone, give yourself  extra room around the bone for extra stuffing.
