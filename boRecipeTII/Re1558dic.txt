Tip the butter beans into a sieve or colander and rinse thoroughly to get  rid of any traces of their rank soaking liquid. Shake dry and tip into a  mixing bowl.    Drain the tuna and break into chunks over the beans. Season with black  pepper and a little salt.    Quarter the tomato lengthways, remove seeds and core and slice each quarter  into 3 or 4 strips. Dice.    Give the capers a good squeeze to get rid of most of their soaking liquid.    Pick the leaves from the parsley and coarsely chop: you want a couple of  tablespoonfuls. Add tomatoes, capers and most of the parsley to the salad.    Shred the lettuce, rinse and shake dry.    Now make the vinaigrette. Peel and finely dice the shallot. If using spring  onions and garlic, trim the spring onions and finely slice the white part.  Peel and finely chop the garlic. Dissolve the sugar and salt in the  vinegar. Season generously with black pepper, stir in the mustard and the  the shallot or onion and garlic. Stir in the olive oil, added in a trickle.  Pour the vinaigrette over the bean mixture and toss well. Place the  shredded lettuce in the bottom of a salad bowl or on two plates, spoon the  beans over the top and garnish with the reserved parsley.
