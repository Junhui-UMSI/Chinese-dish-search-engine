Frye" <shfrye@PEN.K12.VA.US>  Here is a recipe that is best assembled the night before, after the kids  are in bed, then popped into the oven when you get home from work. While it  bakes, put your feet up, let the kids watch Barney (the purple dinosaur I  hate), have a glass of chilled wine, and relax.....    Brown hamburger and onion; drain. Add Ragu, spices, sugar, salt, and water.  Simmer for about 30 minutes. Cook noodles according to package directions.  Drain.    In a "lasagna" sized casserole, layer the drained noodles and the ragu  mixture, beginning and ending with the sauce. Top with shredded cheese.  Bake at 375 degrees (covered) for 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake for 10  minutes more.    Optional center layer: Mix together 1 egg, 1 1/2 cups cottage cheese, salt,  and pepper. Spread this over the first layer of sauce/noodles, and then  continue layering.    This optional center layer will make this casserole taste just like  lasagna.    This casserole can be prepared to the baking point, then frozen. Thaw  before baking.    Make TWO casseroles out of this if you have a small family.  Bake one and  freeze one for an emergency.    Personal note: This recipe was given to me by Alice Robertson, my next door  neighbor. Whenever either of us makes this, we divide the casserole in two  parts and share with each other.
