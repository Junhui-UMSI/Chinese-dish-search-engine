Andys Creole Shrimp
Shrimp, Garlic salt, Butter, Tabasco, Lemon juice, Worcestershire, Bottle Wishbone Italian, 
Place unpeeled shrimp in a large baking pan. Pour dressing and lemon juice  over shrimp; cut sticks of butter into small pieces scattering over shrimp.  Sprinkle mixture with seasonings. When melted, liquid should just about  cover the shrimp. Bake at 300 degrees for about an hour, turning  frequently. Have plenty of napkins available! Serves 6 to 8.
