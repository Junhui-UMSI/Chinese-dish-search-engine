Fill layers with lemon filling.    Lemon Filling: Mix sugar, cornstarch, and salt in saucepan. Stir in water  gradually. Cook, stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils. Boil  and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat; add lemon peel and butter. Stir in  lemon juice and food coloring; cool. If filling is too soft, refrigerate  until set.    White Frosting: Mix sugar, corn syrup, and water in saucepan. Cover; heat  to rolling boil over medium heat. Remove cover and boil rapidly to 242F on  candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture dropped into very cold  water forms a ball that holds its shape when pressed. As mixture boils,  beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Pour hot syrup very slowly in a  thin stream into egg whites, beating constantly on medium speed. Add  vanilla; beat on high speed until stiff peaks form.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Linda S. Elrod" <lselrod@WOLVERINE.CAMERON.EDU>  on Nov 24, 1997
