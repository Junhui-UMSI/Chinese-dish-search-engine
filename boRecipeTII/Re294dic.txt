A recipe from a lurker - per Jeffs request. About 20 years ago, when her  husband was Ambassador to the US, Leah Rabin had an article written about  her in the magazine Family Circle and it included this wonderful Honey  Cake.    Bake at 300 for one hour 15 minutes in a 10 inch tube pan.    Grease the 10" tube pan. Heat honey and coffee to boiling in a medium size  saucepan. Cool completely. Stir in brandy. Sift flour, baking powder,  baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg onto waxed paper, add  almonds, raisins and lemon rind. Beat eggs slightly in a large bowl, add  honey mixture, sugar adn oil. Beat until smooth and completely blended. Add  flour mixture and beat until batter is smooth; pour batter into prepared  pan. Bake until center springs back when lightly pressed with fingertip.  Cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes; loosen around edges and tube, turn  out onto rack to cool completely.
