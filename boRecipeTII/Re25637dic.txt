Avocado-Cream Sauce for Pasta
Salt, Avocado, Bakje tuinkers, Lemon, 80g pkg Boursin with herbs, Koffieroom, Pasta with shape (e.g.,, Achterham, 
Translations: "achterham" is a nice sliced lunchmeat-type ham. For a  vegetarian dinner, omit this; or, maybe, replace with mushrooms.    "tuinkers". Hmmm...I really dont know the English name for this, or recall  seeing anything similar. Its in the cress family, but smaller-leaved than  watercress. You buy a little box (the bakje) that is filled with a  sponge-like block. The tuinkers are sprouting from that, maybe one inch  high. You take you kitchen shears or a knife and cut off what you want.  Anybody know what this is? Theyre good sprinkled in a salad. I suppose you  could use some kind of sprouts, maybe mixed, with radish sprouts included  for the peppery taste.    Peel the avocado and remove the seed. Cut into chunks and place in food  processor (or blender).    Wash the lemon. Into the processor, finely grate half the peel, avoiding  the white part. Add the juice from half the lemon to the processor (other  half not used).    Add the Boursin and koffieroom to the processor. Whiz till smooth.    Pour into a small saucepan. Warm over low heat from about 10 minutes.    Meanwhile, cut the ham into strips. Cut the tunikers from their bed. Stir  into sauce. Add S&P to taste.    Serve over a shaped pasta. Penne was good, but maybe try something a bit  smaller.
