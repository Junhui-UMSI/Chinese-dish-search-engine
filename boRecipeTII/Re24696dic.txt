Atlanta Banana Bread
yellow cake, nuts, bananas, Vanilla extract, Eggs, 
Notes: From Houston (Texas) Chronicle files.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan. Mash  bananas in a bowl and add dry cake mix, eggs, vanilla and nuts. Beat 2  minutes at medium speed of electric mixer. Pour into prepared pan and bake  1 hour or until cake tests done.    Gibson says she finds the recipe is too much batter for one pan so she  divides it between two loaf pans. Cake with pudding mix included also may  be used, she said.
