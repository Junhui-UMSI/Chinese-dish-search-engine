Veal Birds
Bacon drippings, Onion, Green pepper; diced, Shallots; diced, Tomato paste, Water, -(up to), Veal rounds, Salt and pepper to taste, 
Cut rounds into 2 by 4 inch pieces. Pound the meat (this tenderizes and  makes it more workable).  Salt and pepper the meat to taste. Place onion  pieces in each strip and roll. Tie with string. Thoroughly brown the birds  in skillet containing hot bacon drippings. Add shallots, green peppers,  tomato paste and enough water to cover the birds. Cover the skillet and  allow to simmer 30 minutes, or until meat is fork tender. (Beef rounds may  be used if sliced very thin.)    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.
