Source: Food from the Arab world?    Big glass jars of these rose colored pickles decorate the front windows of  many Arab restaurants in the Middle East. They are easily prepared and are  very good with meza.    Very good with Mujaddarah.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #027 by Daniella De Picciotto  <daniela@dialdata.com.br> on Jan 23, 1997.
