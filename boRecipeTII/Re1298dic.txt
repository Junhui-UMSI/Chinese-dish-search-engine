Cut eggplant into 1-inch cubes. *** Saute in butter for 30 minutes until  lightly browned, stirring frequently. Add tomatoes. Reserve 2 teaspoons  chopped onion and add remaining onions to the tomato-eggplant mixture,  along with the garlic, bay leaves and marjoram. Cook over low heat for 15  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add stock and rice and season to taste with  salt and pepper. Simmer soup, covered, for 40 minutes, then bring to a  boil.    Mix together the ground beef, reserved onions, nutmeg, oregano and salt and  pepper to taste. Shape into 1/2-inch balls and cook in the boiling soup for  15 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with dill.    Notes:    * - Original recipe called for 3 tablespoons each butter and oil.    ** - I used 93%-lean ground beef. The recipe called for veal. If I  substitute "extra lean ground beef" in the recipe, MasterCook shows the  recipe to be about 35% cff. However, the MasterCook ingredient list is from  the USDA Nutrient Database (I believe), and the USDA Nutrient Database  defines extra lean ground beef as 17% fat. Therefore, I believe 93%-lean  ground beef is acceptable. However, I am leaving "veal" in the recipe for  those who may not agree with my reasoning.    *** - Original recipe called for soaking eggplant cubes in salted water for  20 minutes. I find this unnecessary if the eggplant is fresh.    Recipe by: The Tomato Book/Tarr (adapted)    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Deborah Kirwan" <kirwan@creighton.edu> on Oct  14, 1998,
