Yogurt replaces mayonnaise for this light version of a layered salad,  reducing the fat from 30 grams to six grams per serving. This is a  make-ahead recipe because of the long standing/refrigeration time.    Place yogurt in cheesecloth-lined sieve set over bowl. Cover and  refrigerate for 4 hours or until reduced to about 2-1/2 cups. Transfer to  bowl; discard liquid. Stir in garlic, vinegar, salt, sugar and pepper.    In 8 or 9 inch round bowl, layer lettuce, then onion, red peppers and  cucumber. Spread top with yogurt mixture. Refrigerate, loosely covered, for  up to 12 hours. Sprinkle with feta cheese and mint. Garnish with olives and  tomatoes.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Brenda  Kosky <bkosky@kosky.com> on Aug 10,  1998,
