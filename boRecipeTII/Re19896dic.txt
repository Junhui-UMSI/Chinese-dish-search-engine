Apple Beef Brisket
apple jelly, salt, Apple juice, Beef brisket, Garlic, Dijon mustard, Parsley, Dry white wine, garlic, Green Onions, Curry powder, Black Pepper, Yellow onion, 
Place brisket, the yellow onion, chopped garlic and garlic cloves in a  large Dutch oven.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat,  cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours or until the brisket is tender. Drain brisket.  (If you wish, you could keep the brisket covered with the cooking liquid  and refrigerate it overnight. This will help prepare for the next day.) In  a small saucepan, mix together the apple jelly, wine, mustard, green  onions, salt, pepper, and curry powder. Heat until the jelly melts.    Place brisket in a shallow roasting pan and brush some of the jelly mixture  over the top.  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 minutes, basting 3 or 4 times  with the remaining jelly mixture. Remove the meat to a platter to keep  warm.  Place the pan over 2 burners and add apple juice, stirring to scrape  up browned bits on bottom of pan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Boil, stirring, until slightly thickened and reduced by about half. Pour  into a gravy boat. Slice meat and garnish with the parsley. Serve with  gravy.
