Tobins Pool Hall Chili
Ketchup; one bottle, Black pepper; or to taste, Tabasco; or to taste, Chili powder, Salt, Garlic powder, Ground beef, Onion powder, 
Place hamburger meat in large skillet. Now the secret: Cover with water,  bring to a simmer and stir to break up the meat into very small pieces,  about 5-10 minutes. Drain meat and return to skillet. Add the ketchup and  spices, rinsing out ketchup bottle with water and adding the water to the  chili mixture.    Stir and simmer for about 15 minutes. If it gets too thick, add a little  water. If it gets too thin, simmer a little longer.    Freeze leftovers in a zip-top bag, or make beef nachos by placing 1/2  tablespoon chili on each tortilla chip, topping with shredded cheddar and  Jack cheese and sliced jalapeno peppers, and microwaving or broiling until  cheese melts.

John Avinger of Shem Creek  Bar & Grill writes, "Eddy Tobin, who ran Tobins Pool Hall back in the  60s, shared his secret for chili. Note I said secret, not recipe.  Theres a simple little twist in making this chili smooth and almost  fat-free - the latter being an added bonus with todays health concerns."
