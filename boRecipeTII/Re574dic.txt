At the end of each month, The Cook & Kitchen Staff select some of the best  recipes sent to Recipe-a-Day during the month, and post them to the entire  membership. Todays offering is from Recipe-a-Day Member Sexy Gram.    Todays recipe is a great little salad that requires neither that you are  sexy, nor a Grandma, to prepare. It may be served as a dessert or side  dish, depending on what youre wearing right now... So, what are you  wearing? Just kidding, that Sexy Gram thing threw us off track for a  moment. You go, girl!    Drain canned fruits and place in a large mixing bowl, making sure to  reserve the liquids from the sliced peaches, mandarin oranges, pineapple  chunks, and cherries.    Prepare vanilla pudding as directed on the package, with one exception:  Substitute the reserved fruit liquids for the amount of milk called for.    The recipe works best if you prepare the canned fruits and the pudding the  day before serving and refrigerate both overnight.    In the morning, prepare the fresh fruits as directed. Add the bananas,  strawberries, and honeydew melon to the pudding and canned fruit. Stir well  to combine.    Kitchen Staff Tips: Nearly any fruit you desire will work well in this  recipe. Substitute canned apricots or pears for the peaches, or cantaloupe  for the honeydew melon, kiwi fruit for bananas, or use just whatever fruit  your family likes best.    Also, about a cup of walnuts or unsweetened coconut makes a great addition  to the recipe. If youre serving your fruit salad as a dessert, a dab of  freshly whipped cream makes a great addition to each serving.
