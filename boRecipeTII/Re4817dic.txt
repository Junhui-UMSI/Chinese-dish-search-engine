Many thanks to Mary Jane Womack of Merced, California, for this delicious  one-dish dinner. A real family pleaser, the ground turkey "crust" is filled  with pizza-flavored vegetables and cheese.    Combine turkey, crumbs, 1/4 cup of the Pace Picante Sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of  the oregano and 2 cloves garlic in medium bowl; mix well. Press onto bottom  and sides of 9" pie plate. Bake at 350F. 20 minutes. While shell is  baking, cook vegetables and remaining garlic in oil in 10" skillet 5  minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in remaining 3/4 cup Pace Picante  Sauce, tomato paste, olives and remaining 3/4 teaspoon oregano. Simmer 5  minutes or until thickened. Stir in Parmesan cheese; spoon into baked  shell. Top with mozzarella cheese; return to oven 10 minutes or until  cheese is melted. Serve with additional Pace Picante Sauce.
