Todays offering is a fantastic salsa-from-scratch recipe --  and we know one when we see one, as weve been experimenting with homemade  salsa for several years!    Recipe-a-Day Member Sharron informed us that "this recipe has been in our  family for about 42 years and has been a delight for all. I hope that the  good readers of your recipes enjoy this great salsa. What a savings making  it yourself as compared to store-bought, and it has much better texture and  fresh flavor."    Yields about 6 Pints    Prepare all chopped ingredients as directed, or adjust quantities of  jalapeno and hot banana peppers to produce desired range of salsa taste  temperatures, from mild to extremely hot.

Seal, following directions for a hot water bath or pressure cooker. May  store for at least one year when properly sealed.
