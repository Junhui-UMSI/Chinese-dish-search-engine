Pumpkin Puree
See below, 
Method #1:    I always wait to carve our pumpkin until the day before Halloween.  That way we can enjoy a jack-o-lantern and use the pumpkin for  baking. It shouldnt spoil sitting out for a day. After all the seeds  are out of the pumpkin you can cook it by cutting it in half and  laying it flesh-side down on a baking sheet. Cook in a moderate oven  (about 325 degrees) for at least an hour. Check it frequently. When  the flesh is soft, scoop it away from the rind. Put it in a food  processor and pulse a few times to make it smooth. You can then use  it in recipes or freeze in bags for later use. I usually put about 2  cups in a bag. When using fresh (or frozen) pumpkin remember that it  is more watery than canned pumpkin. So cut down slightly on the  liquids in most recipes."    Method #2:    To make the puree, cut a slice off the top of a fresh pumpkin with a  good sharp knife. Remove the seeds (see the recipe for toasting  them), peel, cut meat into big pieces and soak it 2 hours in very  cold water. Drain, place in a saucepan full of boiling water and let  boil covered until tender -- it can take from 40-90 minutes,  depending on the quality of the pumpkin. Drain well, pass through a  sieve to puree, then use or freeze.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
