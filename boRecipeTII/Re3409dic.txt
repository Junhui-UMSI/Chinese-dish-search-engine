Pecan Bread
Yeast, Salt, Toasted chopped pecans, milk, Corn oil, Whole wheat flour, 
Place ingredients in breadmaker. Process on white  bread cycle. Any nut can be substituted for pecans.   They dont really need to be chopped before placing  in the breadmaker. Sometimes I need to add extra flour  to this recipe. As always oat flour is a fine  preservative and your bread will keep longer.
