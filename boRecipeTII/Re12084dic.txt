Prepare sauce at least 2 hour before serving to allow it to marinate. In a  large serving bowl, combine the oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, olives, capers  and red pepper flakes. Place a strainer over the serving bowl; squeeze the  juice from the tomato halves into strainer. (Push on seeds with back of a  wooden spoon to extract tomato liquid.) Discard the seeds. Coarsely chop  tomatoes and add to olive mixture. Salt & pepper to taste ; toss well.    Cook pasta per package directions. Drain pasta and add to the bowl while  still hot; toss well.

We now marinate this overnight or even  two days in refridgerator.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #018 by Hank & Anne Reintges  <hgreintges@SkyBest.Com> on Jan 18, 1998
