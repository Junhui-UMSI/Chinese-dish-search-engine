Celeriac Slaw
celeriac, celery, Low fat buttermilk, Vegetable oil, Fresh Lemon Juice, salt and pepper, Capers, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon, 
Peel celeriac with a paring knife. Cut into 1" thick slices, then cut into  very thin ribbons (use a mandoline if you have one), placing in cold water  to prevent browning. Drain and blanch briefly in boiling salted water.  Squeeze out water and set aside.    Peel celery and slice on an angle as thinly as possible. Set aside.    In a blender or food processor, combine buttermilk, oil, lemon juice, and  salt and pepper to taste. Process until smooth. Add capers and herbs and  process 5-10 seconds, until coarsely chopped.    Combine celeriac and celery in a bowl and toss with the dressing.
