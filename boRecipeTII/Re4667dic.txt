Pheasant with Roasted Garlic and Lemon
Pheasant, olive oil, Garlic, Chicken Stock, Fresh Lemon Juice, Salt, zest of 1 lemon, Sugar, Water, Whipping cream, 
PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Heat the oil in a 12-inch oven-proof skillet over  high heat on top of stove, add the garlic and saute until the skins are a  medium golden color. Add pheasant and brown on both sides. If the garlic  turns black, remove it from the skillet. When the pheasant is brown,  replace the garlic. Without pouring off the fat, add broth and juice.  Sprinkle with salt, bring to a boil and place, uncovered, in the oven for  50 minutes, turning once.   TO MAKE CANDIED ZESTS: CUT THE LEMON ZEST into  1/4-inch strips and place in a small saucepan.   Add sugar and water, bring  to a boil over medium heat. Simmer gently until the water is nearly  evaporated and zests look shiny and translucent. Strain zests, discard any  extra syrup and set zests aside. Transfer the skillet with the chicken to  the stove top, add the cream and place over high heat. Reduce the liquid until it has a shiny consistency. Arrange the pheasant pieces on a serving  platter, scrape the garlic cloves and glaze over it and garnish with  candied zests.   Serve immediately.
