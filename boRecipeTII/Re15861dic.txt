Aceite De Achiote (Achiote Oil)
Oil, olive; extra virgin, Chile, malagueta, dried, Annotto seeds; crushed, HEAT SCALE  MEDIUM, Bay Leaves, 
Combine all ingredients in a non-reactive heavy saucepan, allow to steep  for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Bring mixture to a low and gentle  boil while stirring continuously. Remove saucepan from heat and allow to  cool thoroughly. Strain through a very fine sieve and pour the strained oil  into a bottle and cap tightly. This oil will remain up to 6 months if it is  refrigerated and capped tightly. This is a MEDIUM HOT condiment.    This oil is used both to color and to flavor dishes. Use it in place of  vegetable oil for South American recipes. Use only annatto (achiote) seeds  that are bright-reddish in color; seeds that are brownish are old and have  probably lost much of their flavor.
