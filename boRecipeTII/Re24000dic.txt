To prepare the dressing: In a blender or food processor, pur?e the  drained pear halves with the lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt and  pepper until very smooth and silky. Transfer to a jar, cover and  refrigerate.    2. To prepare the salad: Place the chopped walnuts in a small dry skillet.  Toast over medium heat about 4 minutes, until fragrant. Remove from the pan  and set aside.    3. Place the salad mix in a bowl and cover with a paper towel. Refrigerate  until ready to serve.    4.
