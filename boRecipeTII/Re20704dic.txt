Mix next four ingredients, pour over slices  and mix well. Pour mixture into deep, oven-proof dish or pan.    Mix flour, sugar and oatmeal for crumble and cut in butter or margarine  until crumbly.  Sprinkle on top of apples.    Bake at 400 degrees 40 to 50 minutes, or until done and brown on top. Serve  hot or cold as desired.    Mm-recipes Digest V3 #207    From the MealMaster recipe list.
