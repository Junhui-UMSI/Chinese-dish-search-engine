In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add  the green and red bell peppers; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender,  about 4 minutes. Add the green onions during the last minute; stir until  tender but not browned. Add the curry powder; stir for about 30 seconds.    Stir in the corn, vegetable stock and pepper. When the liquid begins to  boil, reduce the heat to medium; cover and cook until the vegetables are  tender, about 5 minutes.    Transfer 2 cups of the corn-pepper mixture to a food processor fitted with  the metal blade. Add 1 cup of the soy milk. Process until the mixture is  nearly smooth.    Pour the pureed mixture into the saucepan; stir in the remaining 1 to 2  cups soy milk, depending on if you desire a thin or thicker chowder. Stir  gently over medium heat until the mixture is heated through, about 5  minutes. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Garnish each serving with paprika  and cheddar cheese, if desired.    Makes 4 servings (about 1 1/4 cups per serving).
