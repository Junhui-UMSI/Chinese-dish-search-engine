Banana Pudding
Vanilla, Salt, Flour, Sugar, milk, Egg whites, Egg yolks, Sugar, Bananas, vanilla wafers, 
For custard: Mix 1 cup sugar, flour and salt in a bowl. Pour milk into a  heavy saucepan and add dry ingredients. Heat but do not boil. Beat egg  yolks. Pour some of the hot milk mixture into egg yols and beat briefly,  then add egg yolk mixture to the base mixture in saucepan. Bring to boil  over low heat, stirring constantly, and cook slowly til just thick enough  to coat the back of a spoon. Be careful that the mixture doesnt scorch.  Add the vanilla; remove from heat and cover with plastic wrap to prevent a  skin from forming on top. Line the bottom of a 9 x 13" baking pan with  vanilla wafers. Put a layer of bananas, then a layer of wafers til you have  used all the bananas and wafers. Pour custard over top, completely covering  bananas and wafers. Heat oven to 375@. Beat egg whites til soft peaks form.  Add 2 tbsp sugar and beat til stiff peaks form. Spread meringue fully over  the top of the pudding. Bake til browned, about 15 to 20 mins.
