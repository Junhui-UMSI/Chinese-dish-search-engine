Grate the orange peel, being careful to leave the white pith behind.  Reserve.    Remove and discard remaining rind and seeds. Place reserved peel and orange  pulp into blender; puree. This should make about 1/2-3/4 cup.    Place pulp and remaining ingredients in large saucepan. Heat to boiling  over medium heat, stirring constantly until thick, about 30 minutes.    Cool and store in the refrigerator. For spicy butter, add nutmeg before  removing from heat.    Posted to fatfree digest V98 #007 by "Bethann D. Watson"  <bwatson@cisco.com> on Jan 07, 1998
