Peanut Butter and Jam Twists
Salt, Warm water, Eggs, flour, Peach jam, milk, Sugar, Butter, Planters Creamy peanut, 
I have an ancient "Bake-it-Easy Yeast book" (actually, more of a pamphlet)  from Fleischmanns with a recipe for Peanut Butter and Jam Twists, which  may be the peanut butter braid recipe someone wanted. Ive never made it,  but it sounds interesting. By the way, the Fleischmanns recipes are  generally excellent, especially the challah and Italian breads.    Scald milk; stir in sugar, salt and 1/4 cup Fleischmanns margarine. Cool  to lukewarm. Measure warm water into large warm bowl. Sprinkle in yeast;  stir until dissolved. Add lukewarm milk mixture, eggs, and 3 cups flour;  beat until smooth. Add enough additional flour to make a stiff dough. Turn  out onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 to  10 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover; let rise  in warm place until doubled (1 hour).    Meanwhile, prepare filling. Combine peanut butter, peach jam, and 6  tablespoons softened margarine. Beat until smooth; set aside.    Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each half into a 12x15 inch  rectangle. Cut each rectangle into twenty 3-inch squares. Place about 2  teaspoons of filling in the center of each square. Overlap two opposite  corners; seal tightly. Place on greased baking sheets. Let rise until  doubled (1 hour).    Bake at 375 about 15 minutes. Cool on wire racks.
