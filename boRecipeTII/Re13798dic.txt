Wild Turkey with Ginger Chestnut Stuffing
Hot water, Turkey(10-pound), Recipe ginger chestnut, Several bay leaves, Unsalted butter; melted, Salt, Head garlic unpeeled; split, 
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Season the turkey inside and out with the  salt and pepper. Place several bay leaves and the garlic inside the body  cavity. Place the turkey breast-side down on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour  the water in the bottom of the pan and roast 30 minutes. Turn breast-side  up, brush the melted butter on the breast, reduce the heat to 350 degrees,  and roast 1 to 11/2 hours more, or until the juices run clear when the  thigh joint is pierced with a fork and the internal temperature in the  thickest part of the meat reaches 165. If the water evaporates before the  turkey has finished roasting, add more hot water, to keep the turkey moist.  Allow it to stand 20 minutes before carving. Serve with Ginger Chestnut  Stuffing.
