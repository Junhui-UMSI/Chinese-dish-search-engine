Applesauce Cake Baked in a Jar
Baking Powder, Baking soda, Nuts, chopped (optional), Sugar, Water, Ground cloves, Eggs, Shortening, Applesauce, All-purpose flo sifted, Cinnamon, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 325-degrees.      Sterilize 5 straight-sided Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400- 81400) canning  jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Keep the lids and  rings in the water until youre ready to use them. Remove the jars from the  water and place them on a clean dish towel to air-dry (up, not upside  down). When the jars are cool enough to handle, grease the insides with  shortening (DO NOT use butter, margarine, PAM or Bakers Secret); set  aside.      Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and  cloves; set aside.      Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time  until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water. Blend  the dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture. Fold in the nuts.; set  aside. Fill well greased jars half full. Place the jars onto a cookie sheet  or theyll tip over.      Bake for 35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. like you  would any canned goods.      The method for making the cakes is the same -- no matter which recipe you  use. The only difference will be the ingredients (of course), the amount of  jars needed and the baking times- -thats all, everything else is the same.  Dont limit yourself to the recipes Im giving you -- use your favorite  quick-bread recipe. I plan on trying the Carrot Cake recipe I posted.
