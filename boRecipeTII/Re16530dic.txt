African Vegetable Stew
Salt and pepper,, Garbanzo beans, Raisins, Rice, raw, Garlic, Swiss chard bunch, Onion (very large),, Several fresh tomatoes, Tabasco sauce,, Yams, 
Fry onion, garlic and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add chopped  greens and fry a bit.    Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a vegetable brush, then slice  them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt and  pepper.  Cook a couple of minutes.    Make a well in the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in the  well and pat it down until its wet. Cover and cook until rice is done,  about 25 minutes. Add Tabasco sauce to taste.    NOTES:    *  A spicy vegetable stew -- I got this recipe from my mom, who got it from  a friend. Its very easy to make.    *  I find that the flavors of the vegetables dont stand out unless you put  in a lot of tabasco. But then, Ive got a cast-iron tongue. You should add  enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.  : Precision:  no need to measure.    : Jeff Lichtman at rtech (Relational Technology, Inc.; Alameda, California)  : Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent...  :  : {amdahl, sun}!rtech!jeff  : {ucbvax, decvax}!mtxinu!rtech!jeff    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
