Makes 2 loaves    The Cook and Kitchen Staff are continuing to offer you some of our best  recipes from "Our Daily Bread" collection. Todays exploration of  international breads takes us to England, where a traditionally tasty  muffin recipe is prepared as a loaf.    This recipe is for an easy-to-prepare yeast bread with no kneading  required! The texture is much like that of English muffins, so its perfect  for slicing and toasting because it really gets a grip on your jam, jelly,  or marmalade in the morning.    In a small saucepan, heat the milk and water over medium heat until very  warm.    Meanwhile, combine 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and soda in a large  bowl. Add the warm milk and water, and beat well. Stir in enough of the  remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Spoon into two 9 by 5-inch loaf  pans that have been greased and dusted with the cornmeal. Cover, and let  rise in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour.    Bake in a pre-heated 400-F degree oven for 25 minutes. Remove from pans  immediately, and cool on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container; may  freeze for up to       90    days.
