Following is the recipe from the bag of Gold Medal "Better for Bread"  flour.    The "regular" loaf is for 1-lb. bread machines, and the "large" loaf is for  1 1/2-lb. bread machines.    Place ingredients in bread machine in the order that your bread machine  manufactuer suggests.  Make certain the yeast does not come in contact with  the watter or cottage cheese.    Select regular cycle.  This recipe is not good for a delayed time cycle due  to the fresh dairy ingredients.    >From: as224@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Barbara Buckantz)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Gold Medal "Better for Bread"  NOTES : REGULAR LOAF:(LG LOAF):
