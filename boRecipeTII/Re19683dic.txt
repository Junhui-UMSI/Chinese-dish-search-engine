Poach or bake chicken breasts until tender.  Chill, remove skins and all  visible fat.  Cut each half breast into 1/3" wide diagonal strips (about 2  cups). Place chicken breasts, fennel, red peppers, tomato and olives in  large mixing bowl.  Toss gently  to combine. To serve, mix well with  dressing, adjusting seasonings, vinegar and chicken broth as necessary.  Arrange field greens on chilled  serving plates. Mound salad on greens.  Garnish with fresh  basil.  Serve immediately. Make 4 servings. NOTE: To  roast peppers, stand them on a board and cut sides off in 4 slabs. Arrange,  skin side up, on baking sheet lines with foil. Broil 6" from heat until  skin is blackened. Wrap in foil lining. Slip off skin when cool enough to  handle.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
