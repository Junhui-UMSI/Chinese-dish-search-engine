Wickerhead Co Cafes Cranberry Buttermilk Scones
All-purpose flour, Grated orange rind, Granulated sugar, Eggs, Buttermilk, Frozen cranberries, Baking Powder, Butter, 
Blend 1/4 cup of the flour with cranberries and let stand overnight to  absorb excess moisture.  Next day, mix remaining flour and all other dry  ingredients.  Cut into butter until mixture is consistency of oatmeal. Stir  in cranberries in flour and orange rind.  Blend eggs and buttermilk. Add to  dry ingredients, mixing until just blended. If dough is sticky, flour hands  and pat into a 6-inch ball.  Score deeply into six wedges. Bake in a 400F  oven until top turns golden and springs back, about 15 minutes. Glaze with  fresh cream and sugar immediately after baking. From Wickerhead Co. Cafe,  1910 Queen St. E., Toronto, Ontario.
