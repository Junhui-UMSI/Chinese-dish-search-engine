Without washing beaters, beat cooled pumpkin mixture until smooth and  fluffy.  Gently fold into beaten whites.  Heap lightly in pie shell.  Refrigerate for 3 hours.

Beat until just stiff enough to hold its  shape.  Spread in swirls over pie, or use as dessert topping.  Keep  refrigerated until served.  It will hold up for hours!
