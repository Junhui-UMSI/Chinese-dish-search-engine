Working with 1 artichoke  at at time, cutt off stem flush with bottom.    2. Trim away all leaves until you reach the pale green heart. Pare away  dark green area from base.    3. Cut artichoke in half lengthwide and scooup out and discard choke from  each half. Then cut each half lengthwise into 1/4 inch thick slices and  drop into lemon water.    4. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Drain artichokes and add  to pan. Saute until shiny, then add garlic, potatoes and enough broth to  just cover artichokes, about 1 1/2 cups.    5. Cover pan and simmer over medium heat until artichokes are very tender  and almost falling apart, 25 to 30 minutes.    6. Remove from heat. Transfer to food processor and puree until smooth.  Return to saucepan and add remaining 1 1/2 cups broth. Reheat over low  heat, adding more broth and/or milk or cream to achieve consistence you  prefer. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    7. Serve in shallow soup bowls.
