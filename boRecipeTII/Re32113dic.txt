Hello, Grilling Enthusiasts!    Nearly every occupant of any home or apartment in the world has access to a  charcoal grill, hibachi, gas grill, cast iron grilling skillet, or fire  pit. There is no social class structure, gender, or ethnic group that has  not prepared food over an open flame. The Cook and Kitchen Staff are not  saying that all the worlds issues could be resolved over a barbecue, but  it is nice to recognize one thing that we all have in common on a global  basis.    Todays recipe is a classic for grilled chicken that takes very little time  to put together and makes a lovely main course as prepared over any type of  open flame. As with all grill-prepared meals, cooking time will vary, so  please use your good judgment.    Combine garlic, salt, peppercorns, and coriander in a flat dish with the  cilantro (or parsley) and lime juice. Rub the paste-like mixture well into  the chicken breasts on all sides, cover, and refrigerate overnight or at  least one hour.    Cook chicken over glowing coals, turning about every five minutes, until  chicken is no longer pink and the skin is crisp.    Garnish with tomatoes and curls of scallions.    Serve with a simple salad of cucumber, tomato, and scallions, seasoned with  lime juice, oil, and salt.
