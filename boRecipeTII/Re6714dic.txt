Combine water, sugar, 1 Tbs flour and yeast and leave to rise.  Warm butter  and milk in small pot.  Beat eggs, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup flour, salt and  orange flavoring. Add the milk mixture and the yeast mixture from above.  Add 2 more cups of flour; beat well. Add another 4-5 cups of flour, a cup  of raisins, and beat it some more Turn into a large bowl and cover and let  rise for about an hour. Knead and cut into 4 parts: put each into a loaf  pan.  Let rise one more hour (at halfway, brush with slightly beaten egg  white, and sprinkle with crumb mixture (below)). Bake at 350 F for 35  minutes.    Crumb mixture: Mix all ingredients.    This came from my Great-Grandma and has been enjoyed for several years in  our Polish family.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
