Baked Chicken with Yogurt Crust and Peaches
Cinnamon sugar, Plain yogurt, Whole skinless chicken, Herb-seasoned stuffing mix, Peaches;      peeled and, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a food processor or blender, reduce the  stuffing mix to coarse crumbs.  Pour them onto a sheet of wax paper.  Coat  one piece of chicken breast with yogurt as thickly as possible (admittedly,  this is a messy step), then dip it into the crumbs to coat. Lay the chicken  in an oiled baking dish large enough to hold chicken and peaches in one  layer. Repeat with the remaining chicken.  Surround the chicken with the peach halves, cut side down.  Sprinkle the  peaches (not the chicken) with cinnamon sugar.  Bake for 20 minutes, or  until the breasts are just cooked through but not dry.
