Barley Muffins
Eggs, Salt, Baking Powder, Honey, Barley flour, Rich cream, 
Sift together the barley flour, baking powder, and  salt.  Beat eggs slightly.  Combine eggs, cream, and  honey with dry ingredients and mix well.  Pour batter  into muffin tin and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes The  same book says barley flour can be substituted for  white flour and make an all-barley bread.  So it seems  one could substitute oats for some of the barley in  this recipe to make Barley/oats muffins.
