Baileys - # 2
Canned milk or "Eagle Brand", Coconut extract, Whipping cream, Eggs, Scotch whisky, Chocolate syrup, 
Method: Combine all ingredients in a blender for 1 minute. Let stand  overnight [refrigerated]. Bottle the next day. No waiting time. From Bobbi  Zee. Canned milk is simply evaporated milk; Eagle brand is very much  sweetened - different products. This calls for Scotch whisky, not Irish  whiskey. Yes, they are spelled differently and, yes, they taste different.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 09 Dec 96    From:    Bob Pastorio <pastorio@RICA.NET>    Date:    Mon, 9 Dec 1996 18:56:25 -0800
