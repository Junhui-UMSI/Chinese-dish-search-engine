Strawberry Pie
Strawberries, sliced, All-purpose flour, Crust, Rolled oats, Brown sugar, Melted shortening, All-purpose flour, Sugar, FILLING, 
Preheat oven to 350F.    Combine melted shortening, oats, flour & sugar.  Firmly pack 3/4 of  this mixture into an 8" X 8" baking dish.  Arrange the strawberries  over the top.  Mix together the sugar & flour & sprinkle on top of the  strawberries.  Add the rest of the crumble mixture & pat down gently.    Bake for 30 minutes.  Allow to cool slightly before serving.  Alternately, place in the refrigerator & eat it chilled.  It makes  the filling more syrupy in consistency.
