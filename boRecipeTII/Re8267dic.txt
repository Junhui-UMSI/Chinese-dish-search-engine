Mary. If you printed out my mother-in-laws directions for preparing the  basic grated potato you are half way there to Bulviniai Cepelinai Kukuliai,  or as we say Klatskas. This recipe comes from the Nationality Rooms  Cookbook, U of Pittsburgh. The potato mixture : Grate potatoes into cheese  cloth (the cotton flour bag works better) and squeeze until almost dry,  reserve liquid. starch will settle out. Add egg, flour and some of the  starch to potatoes and mix well. Form into 8 round balls and set aside. Mix  meat with onion and egg and form into 8 balls. Flatten the potato balls and  place meat in center and form the dough around the meat into the shape of  zeppelins. Boil in a large kettle of 4-6qts salted water for 30 minutes.  Caution: For 40 years, mine fell apart, because I couldnt use flour My  husband said his mother never used it. So dont be surprised if they dont  hold together! I also prefer to cook my meat mixture first! Sauce: Chop  bacon and fry, drain and saute onions. Add sour cream, heat and serve over  the zeppelins. I have not used the starch, I have heard of farina or cream  of wheat substituted for flour. A tremendous relief to be able to serve  these after years of failure. Hope your husband will be surprised. He  should like the Kuglis too, on the original bulletin. That is much easier.  :           Joyce 1212 MDT FROM:    JOYCE ALENSKIS    (XMXX58B)
