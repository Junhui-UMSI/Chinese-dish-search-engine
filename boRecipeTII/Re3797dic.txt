Poultry seasoning, Eggs, potatoes, Salt to taste, Carrots, Onion, Bayleaf, Chicken, water, Parsley, Salt, Pepper, Water, celery, Flour, 
1. Place chicken in kettle. Cover with water, salt to taste. Add parsley,  bayleaf, poultry seasoning, pepper, celery, carrots, potatoes and onions.  Simmer until chicken is tender.    2. Remove chicken from bones; skin and cut chicken into bite-size pieces.    3. Sift the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt together onto a board.    4. Make a well in the center and put eggs into it. Gradually work the eggs  into the flour until a stiff dough is formed, adding the hot water as  necessary.    5. Knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cut dough in half and roll each  half until paper thin. Cut dough into 1-inch noodles.    6. Add chicken to simmering broth and add noodles a few at a time. Continue  boiling until noodles are done, about 5 minutes.    NOTE: You can also begin this recipe with some homemade broth or bouillion  and throw in some deboned chicken breast or whatever kind of deboned  chicken parts you like. I always make it with homemade broth. Serve with  crusty bread and salad.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 666 by RecipeLu  <recipelu@geocities.com> on Feb 01, 1998
