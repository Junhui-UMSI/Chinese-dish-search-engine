Vegan Eggplant Parm Stew
Pkg frozen chopped mustard, Chopped, 15oz can Black-eyed peas,, Tomatoes, chopped, Water, Paste, Nutritional yeast, Eggplant, unpeeled and, Onion, Rinsed and drained, Minced fresh garlic, (6oz) can unsalted tomato, Greens, thawed (or half a, Bag), Beans, rinsed and drained, Fresh ground pepper, 15oz can Great Northern, Salt, Dried oregano leaves, 
Combine water, tomato paste, and garlic in very large soup pot.  Add onion,  eggplant and mustard greens.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer,  uncovered, until eggplant is tender, but firm (about 15 minutes).    Combine 2 cups of the soup broth (from pot), the can of Great Northern  beans, the nutritional yeast, and the seasonings in a blender. Process  until very smooth.  Pour into soup pot and mix well.  Stir in black-eyed  peas, and tomatoes.  Simmer, uncovered, until the beans are heated and the  tomatoes softened.    This would probably be really good with cauliflower instead of eggplant,  too.  Mmmm and maybe zucchini.    Adapted from a recipe in _The Uncheese Cookbook_ by Joanne Stepaniak.    From: Michelle Dick <artemis>. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10 Issue 20] Aug. 30,  1994.
