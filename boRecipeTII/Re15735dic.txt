Marinate artichoke hearts with italian herbs and some balsamic vinegar. I  myself add a teaspoon or so of olive oil (someone will be coming to measure  me now, Im sure).    Stir artichoke hearts and rest of ingredients together. DONT put in so  much white stuff that it is too moist because the mushrooms will release  moisture and then it will get gross.    Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes in a French White Corning Ware casserole.  If you put it in anything else it will explode.    This is great as a dip, or in a pita sandwich.  I hope you like it, and I  promise not to post too often until I actually learn to measure and write  :-)    Posted by Cynthia Barnes <cbarnes@bigcat.missouri.edu> to Fatfree Digest  [Volume 13 Issue 13]    FATFREE Recipe collections copyrighted by Michelle Dick 1994.
