Allie and Etells Pickled Eggs And Beets
Salt, Ground cayenne, Trimmed unpeeled beets, White vinegar (this is what, Sugar, Garlic, Onions, Eggs, 
This recipe comes from the well know culinary family of Chef Paul Prudhomme  of New Orleans. I got it from one of his cookbooks.    *NOTE: If you prefer less vinegary taste, increase amount of sugar, but  dont decrease or dilute vinegar.    Cover beets with water. Boil until tender (about 25 minutes). Drain and  cover with cool water. Set aside. Boil eggs in covered pan about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit 15 min. This keeps egg yolks from having green  color. Peel--set aside. In 1 qt. sauce pan, combine vinegar, onions and  garlic. Bring to a boil. Remove and strain vinegar into a bowl. Return  vinegar to pan reserving onions etc. seperately.    In a jar place 4 eggs. After beets are cool enough to handle, peel and  slice 1/4 inch thick. Place half of the beet slices over the 4 eggs, then  half of the strained garlic and onion. Then layer again with remaining  ingredients.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by MiKicks@AOL.COM on Jul 7, 1997
