Puris--Indian Crispbread
Butter, Oil for deep frying, Whole wheat flour, 
Put flour in a large bowl and have butter ready. Chill your fingers by  running them under cold water or rubbing then with ice.  Dry well. Then,  with your fingertips, mix butter into the flour by rubbing bits of flour  and butter briskly in small circles until butter is well distributed  throughout the flour.  Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, gradually  add enough water to make a stiff dough, as with loaf bread. The dough is  moist enough when it begins to hold together and pull away from the sides  of the bowl.  Turn the dough ball out onto a lightly greased surface. Pinch  off small portions one at a time and roll them into circles about 1/8 inch  thick and 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Heat the oil to a temperature of 350  degrees to 375 degrees, or until test piece of dough browns and floats to  the top. With practice, you can fry 2 to 3 puris at a time. Start with one  though. Gently slide it into the hot oil. It will sink, then float to the  top.  When it does, press it gently with the back of a slotted spoon to  make it puff.  Turn it over and let it cook another minute until just  golden brown. With the slotted spoon, lift out the cooked bread and lay it  on clean, absorbent cloths to drain.  Continue in the same way until all  the dough is used. Serve hot.  (And be careful of that hot oil!)
