Asparagus with Orange Butter
Salt, Stick Cold butter; cubed, Asparagus, Juice and zest of 2 oranges, Heavy cream, White wine, Shallots, Black Pepper, 
In a small saucepan combine orange juice, wine and shallots and bring to a  boil over medium heat. When liquids have reduced by half, add cream. Bring  to a boil and reduce heat to very low. Add butter, a few small pieces at a  time, whisking constantly. Add more butter just as last pieces melt, and  continue whisking until all butter is added. Season to taste with salt and  pepper. Set aside in a warm but not hot place. Meanwhile, bring a deep  saucepan of salted water to a boil. If asparagus are tough, peel stems  before cooking. For a pretty presentation, line up tips and chop stems to  same length. Tie asparagus loosely together in two or three bunches with  two pieces of butchers twine each. Add asparagus bundles to pot, stem ends  down, and boil until you can squeeze a piece between your fingers and it is  tender but not soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, remove strings and place on a  serving platter. Drizzle orange sauce over and sprinkle with orange zest.  This recipe yields 4 servings.
