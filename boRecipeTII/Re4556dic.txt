Bake at 375F about  15 minutes or until done. Before removing from pans, immediately prick  cakes with fork. Slowly spoon syrup over cakes. Turn out onto wire rack  after syrup is absorbed. Serve topped with whipped cream and almonds. Rum  Syrup: Bring 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup rum and 1/2 cup water to a full boil,  stirring. Remove from heat; let cool.
