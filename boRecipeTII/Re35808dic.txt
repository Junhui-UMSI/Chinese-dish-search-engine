Review:  "These eggplant boats will win raves for a pretty presentation as  well as their combination of tastes and textures. A low-fat peanut sauce  adds pizzazz."    Halve each eggplalnt, remove the tops and, using a melon baller, scoop out  the flesh, leaving 1/4"-thick shells.    Chop the eggplant flesh and set aside.    Put the shells in boiling salted water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to  soften. Invert and drain on paper towels.    In a rectangular microwave-safe casserole, combine the onions, carrots,  peppers, bok choy, broth and chopped eggplant. Cover with vented plastic or  a lid and microwave on high power for 5 minutes, or until the peppers  soften.    Add the snow peas, rice, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, peanut butter, ginger and  garlic.  Mix well and mound into the eggplant shells.    Rinse out the casserole. Arrange the eggplant shells side by side in the  casserole. Cover and microwave for 2 minutes, or until the vegetables and  rice are heated through.    10 mins attention; 20 mins total.
