Feta cheese, Bulghur, Garlic, Olive oil, Salt, Parsley, Garbanzos, Green onions, Tomatoes, Lemon juice, Water, 
Cover bulghur with boiling water.  Cover, let sit about 30 minutes till all  the water is gone.    Add salt, parsley, green onions (and/or scallions), garlic, lemon juice and  olive oil.  Add 2-3 large tomatoes and garbanzos. Top with 1/4 C feta.    Vickis notes:    *  Bulghur is cracked wheat.  You can find it at health-food stores. You  can also find it in some grocery stores by other grains and pasta.    *  Can substitute scallions for some of the green onions. Some people like  to use mint instead of (or in addition to) the parsley. If you use mint,  might want to add chopped cucumber instead of tomato. Can also add sliced  avocado.    *  Some recipes call for soaking bulghur in more water and wringing it out,  but this leaves too much water!
