Almond Crunch
Sugar, Graham crackers, Sticks butter; do not, Package sliced almonds, 
Preheat oven to 350. Line large cookie sheet with foil. (May also spray  with non-stick spray). Put 10-12 graham crackers on foil. Bring the butter  and sugar to a boil, and boil for 2 minutes. Pour over crackers, then  sprinkle sliced almonds on top. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes until slightly  tan. Slide foil from pan and break in pieces when cool.    NOTES : This is sooooo good!  Its addicting!  Sometimes I pour mixture  over both almonds and crackers. Just experiment! Exchanged by Rhonda Martin  at my 1st annual Christmas Cookie Exchange on 12-3-97. These were my  absolute favorite from all of the different cookies exchanged.
