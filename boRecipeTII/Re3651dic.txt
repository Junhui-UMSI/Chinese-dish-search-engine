Peking Chicken
Breasts, thinly sliced, Flour tortillas, Across the grain, Sesame oil, Skinless, boneless chicken, Hoisin sauce, Cloves of garlic, minced, Honey, Minced fresh giner, Rice wine vinegar, (about 5 teaspoons), Soy sauce, Scallions, 
1.  Combine the garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, and    honey in a small bowl.  Whisk to mix.  Set aside half of this mixture    to use as a sauce.  Marinate the chicken in the remaining mixture for    one to two hours, stirring several times. 2. Meantime, make the  scallion brushes.  Cut the roots and greens off    the scallions.  There should be 3" pieces of scallion white remaining.    Make a series of 1" lengthwise cuts in each end, gradually rotating    the scallion, to form the individual "bristles" of the brush. Soak    the scallions in a bowl of ice water for a couple of hours to swell    the ends of the brushes. 3. Just before serving, heat the oil in a  large non-stick frying pan.    Cook the chicken over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until well done.    Set aside and keep warm.  Lightly brush each tortilla with water and    toast in a non-stick frying pan over high heat (or warm in a steamer).    Divide the reserved marinade among 6 small ramekins or dishes. 4. Mount  the chicken in the center of a platter. Arrange the tortillas    (fold them in quarters or halves and scallion brushes around the    chicken.  Invite guests to use a scallion to brush a tortilla with    hoisin sauce.  Have them place a spoonful of chicken and the scallion    brush in a tortilla and roll it into a cone.
