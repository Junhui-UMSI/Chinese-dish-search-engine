(If you have a food processor, transfer the dough to the food  processor bowl and beat in the eggs one by one, using the steel blade.)    5. Beat in the potatoes, sugar, and the baking powder.    6. Remove to a well-floured board and roll the dough out to a thickness of  1/8 inch. Cut into rounds with a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter.    7. Place an apricot in the center of each round and bring up the dough to  enclose the apricot. Roll into a ball and dust with flour.    8. Bring the water to a boil. Drop the dumplings into the boiling water and  simmer until they rise to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon and arrange  them in a buttered ovenproof dish.    9. Pour buttered bread crumbs over the apricot dumplings and bake on a 375  degree oven until golden brown. Serve immediately. Yield: About 10 to 12  dumplings.
