*  I use cut-up leftover turkey or chicken (approximately 1 1/2 cups).    Heat oven to 375.  Grease a 2-qt. casserole.  Cook and drain noodles as  directed on package.  If using ground turkey, melt butter in a 10" skillet  over medium heat.  Cook turkey, onion and  bell pepper for 4 to 6 minutes,  stirring frequently, until turkey is no longer pink.  (When using leftover  turkey/chicken, cook just the onion and bell pepper for 4 to 6 minutes. Add  turkey/chicken during the last 2 or 3 minutes.)  Stir in tomatoes, salt and  pepper.  Mix ricotta, sour cream and  poppy seed in a large bowl.  Stir in  noodles.  Spoon 3/4s of the noodle mixture into the casserole dish.  Spoon  turkey mixture over noodle mixture.  Top with with remaining noodle  mixture. Cover and bake for 50 minutes or until hot. Sprinkle with Romano  cheese and parsley.
