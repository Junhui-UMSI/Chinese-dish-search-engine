Place the meat in a mixing bowl.  Heat the oil in a small cast-iron  skillet, add the onion and cook, stirring, until wilted. Add the garlic and  cook briefly, stirring. Do not let the garlic burn. Remove from the heat  and let cool.    Add the cooled onion mixture, chili powder, cumin, ground pepper, red  pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce, and salt to the meat and blend well.  Divide the mixture into 4 patties of equal size.    Heat a heavy cast-iron skillet large enough to hold all the patties in one  layer.  Do not add fat of any kind. When the skillet is quite hot and  smoking, add the patties. Cook until well browned on one side, then turn  and cook 3 minutes more on the second side for medium rare. Cook longer if  desired.  Transfer to a warm plate.    Heat the butter in a small skillet.  Add the shallots and cook, stirring  for 1 minute.  Add the wine and broth and let cook until reduced about 1/4  cup.  Check for seasoning and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.  Note: If a heavy black cast-iron pan is not available, use a heavy bottomed  fry pan.
