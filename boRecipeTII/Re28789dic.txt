Thai Cabbage Salad
Soy sauce, Green-leaf lettuce leaves, Minced fresh garlic, Ground fresh chili paste;, Bag shredded cabbage, Shredded carrot, Fresh lime juice, 
Pour the lime juice and soy sauce in a small jar. Add the chili paste and  garlic and shake well to mix. Set aside.    Place shredded cabbage and carrot in a bowl. Mix well. Pour the dressing  over the vegetables and toss to mix. Serve on lettuce leaves. Serves 4.    NOTE: Ground fresh chili paste is also known as Sambal Oelek. It can be  found in Asian markets. The preparation time is 5 minutes (why does it  always take me twice as long?) or sop it says in the book. Patty  Posted to fatfree digest by "Richard M. Swanson" <sharpy@sedona.net> on Apr  25, 1998
