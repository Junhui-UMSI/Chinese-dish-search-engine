Source: Ive had this for years, dont know where it originated from.    Loaf:    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    2. In a large bowl combine all loaf ingredients, mix well (will be very  moist).    3. Spread into GREASED loaf pans (I usually use 1 - 9" x 5" and a mini)    4. Bake 45 minutes, until knife comes out clean. (can remain in turned off  or low temperature oven for quite a while to keep warm)    Sauce:    5. Shell eggs and cut into thin wedge; discard yolks, if desired.    6. In a saucepan, over medium heat combine oil, flour and pepper, until  blended.    7. Gradually add milk and continue cooking until thick and smooth; stirring  constantly.    8. Turn heat to lowest possible. Gently stir in eggs and sour cream/yogurt.    9. Stir in dill or parsley to taste.    To serve:    10. Invert loaves on platter and pour half of sauce over loaves. Put rest  of sauce in gravy dish to serve. Garnish with parsley for pretty  presentation. Serve immediately.    NOTE: If perferred 2 - 1 lb. cans of salmon, bones removed and drained, can  be substituted for tuna.
