Combine milk and eggs; mix into flour with  a fork until just moistened. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface;  knead gently. Roll to 3/4" thickness. Cut with a 2" figured cutter and  place on an ungreased baking tray. Bake 12 mins or until golden.    VARIATION: Instead of baking biscuits separately, place the dough on top of the hot set in an ovenproof pan. Bake at 350F for about 18 mins until they are golden brown. Serve straight from the pan by scooping out a biscuit and some stew all together.
