source: I concocted this    Cut off top of peppers & scoop out seeds. Fill about 2/3 with raw rice.  saute onion & garlic in a bit of oil until tender crisp. Add chicken parts,  stand up peppers around & in-between, add tomato sauce & water to barely  cover. Tightly cover pot, bring to a boil and simmer gently until done.    I used to make this Friday afternoon just before Shabbos and after cooking  for a little while would place on the blech until dinner. It was delicious.  You could add dill, parsley, other vegetables as you wish. You could also  make it without the chicken but it does add flavor. Enjoy!
