Chicken Style Seasoning
Powdered Thyme, Garlic powder, Marjoram, Rosemary, Food yeast, Sweet pepper flakes;, Onion powder, Salt, Powdered Sage, 
Here is a good mix recipe that I got from the vegetarian cookbook,  ("oil-free, sugar-free, dairy-free") EAT FOR STRENGTH by Dr. Agatha Thrash:    Mix well and store in glass jar tightly closed.    This is good for broth, for seasoning various dishes or making soups. Its  very versatile.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Maggie" <maggie@vh.net> on Nov 15, 1998,
