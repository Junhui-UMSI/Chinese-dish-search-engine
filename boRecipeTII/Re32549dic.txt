Sweet Hearts
Red food coloring (up to 4), Granulated sugar, Vanilla extract, Eggs, Orange or almond extract, 
Preheat oven to 250 deg. (No, its not your normal cookie baking  temperature!) Allow the eggs to reach room temperature before separating  the whites and yolks into two containers. Use a medium-sized bowl for the  whites, and refrigerate the yolks to use another day. Beat the egg whites  with an electric beater until stiff. Add 6 tbsp. of sugar, beating them in  one at a time. Continue beating until the mixture is very stiff, like  shaving cream. Add the vanilla extract, and the orange or almond extract.  Add a few drops of red food coloring to give the mixture a pink color. Fold  in another 2 tbsp. of sugar, one at a time. Using a rubber spatula, divide  the frothy mixture into four equal parts. Place one part on each quarter of  a greased and floured cookie sheet. Form each blob into a heart by pushing  the froth out and away from the center. Bake at 250deg; for 90 minutes, or  until firm to the touch. Notes: Just before baking, you may decorate your  hearts with colored sugar crystals or cinnamon hearts. If your cookies are  removed from the oven too soon, theyll be chewy instead of light and airy.    busted by sooz  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 229 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Nov 09, 1997
