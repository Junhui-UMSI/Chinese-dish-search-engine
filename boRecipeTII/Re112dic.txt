King Cake
Active dry yeast, Warm water, (110 degrees), Milk, (to 5) all-purpose flour,, (2 sticks) butter, Granulated sugar, Salt, Eggs, Butter, Light corn syrup, Colored sugars, (see note), 
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk and enough flour (about 1/2 to 1  cup) to make a soft dough. In a separate bowl, cream butter, sugar, salt  and eggs (use low speed of an electric mixer). Add the soft ball of yeast  dough and mix thoroughly. Gradually add about 2-1/2 cups flour to make a  medium dough. Place in greased bowl and brush top of dough with melted  butter. Cover with damp cloth and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 3  hours. Sprinkle 1 cup flour on board. Place dough on board and knead until  smooth (8 to 10 minutes), adding more flour if necessary. Divide dough into  three long strips. Plait strips to make one long braid. (Or, roll dough  into a long strand and twist.) Place on greased cookie sheet and form into  an oval ring, connecting ends by pinching together with dampened fingers.  Cover with damp cloth and let rise until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour).  Bake in 325-degree oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until lightly browned. To  decorate cake, brush top lightly with corn syrup and sprinkle with  alternate bands of purple, green and gold sugar. If desired, push a "baby"  (nut, pea, bean or trinket) into cake from underneath. Yield: 1 king cake.  Note: To color sugar, add a few drops of food coloring to granulated sugar  in a jar; tightly cover jar and shake to mix. Recipe, an exclusive on  POSTnet.
