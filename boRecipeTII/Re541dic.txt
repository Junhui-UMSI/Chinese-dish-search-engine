Published in the Los Angeles Times, July 22, 1998, in an article written by  Michelle Huneven    Ms Huneven writes: "This is one of the best recipes for tomatoes Ive ever  found. the results vary, depending on the density of the tomato. Sometimes  the casserole is very soupy and is best served in small bowls; other times,  the bread crumbs absorb most of the liquid and form a thick sauce. The more  you make it, the more you will get a feel for it....This gratin is always  delicious."    1. Grease bottom and sides of 2 1/2 quart oval baking dish with 1  tablespoon butter.    2. Reserve 1 tablespoon butter.    3. Place 1 layer tomato slices in bottom of dish. Sprinkle with salt and  pepper and dot with some of the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.    4. Make another layer of tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot  with butter.    5. Continue layers and seasonings until all tomatoes are used,    6. Press down firmly on final layer. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and dot  with butter.    7. Pour cream over tomatoes until it just starts showing along sides at  top.    8. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet. Stir in bread crumbs and toss to  coat with butter. Stir in thyme. Sprinkle evenly over top of tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.    9. Bake at 375 degrees until top is nicely browned, 45 minutes to 1 hour.    345 calories; 213 mg sodium; 103 mg cholesterol; 31 grams fat; 17 grams  carbohydrates; 4 grams protein; 1.50 grams fiber.
