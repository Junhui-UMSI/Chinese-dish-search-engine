Baked Macaroni and Cheese
Eggs, cheddar, elbow macaroni, 
In 9x13" pan, spray with Pam. Spread half of cooked macaroni in pan.  Sprinkle half of each cheese on top, using monterey jack in middle. Dot  with butter, and pour half of egg on top. Pour evaporated milk on top  (maybe about 1/4 - scant 1/2 of can). Repeat.    Bake at 350-375F until cooked throughout, and top is brownish.    Very rich, but delish. Freezes well.
