Here is some thing that is on the theme I think. It can use either  left-over turkey or chicken. Easy, good, and not costly. This comes from a  recipe book called: Pepin United Methodist "Potluck". It is from my home  town in Pepin, Wisconsin. Nadia in Texas    Combine all ingredients and bake. When it starts to cook, stir gently once  or twice. Use a 3-quart casserole or 9x13-inch pan and bake at 350 degrees  for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 360 by ncanty@juno.com (Nadia I  Canty) on Dec 11, 1997
