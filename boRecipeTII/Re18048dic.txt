Veggie Bread for the Abm
Fresh parsely; minced or 2, Salt, 6-oz jar Gerber toddler baby, Tomato juice, Canola; (or your pref.) oil, Sugar, Onion; 1/4-inch, minced fine, 
Mix this together in a small saucepan and heat very gently, just to a warm  stage,Not Hot! Add one egg and mix it into the above. You will have about    1 1/4    cups liquid.    Put this into your ABM bread pan, add 3 cups of white bread flour, then 1  1/2 teaspoons of yeast. Turn it on and wait. It smells wonderful while  rising and baking. This is a great specialty bread and if you are the  reckless kind, makes a wonderful grilled cheddar sandwich!
