A recipe for Buffalo from McCurdys New Game Kitchen    To prepare fresh jalapenos, hold each by the stem over a gas flame or  almost touching an electric burner on high, turning until chili is charred  on all sides. Let chilies stand until cool. Wearing gloves (to prevent  hands touching eyes) pull blistered skin from chilies. Cut chilies in half  lengthwise and scrape out seeds and veins; cut off stems. Chop chilies  finely; discard remainder. For pickled chilies, cut off and discard stems  and chop finely.    Add oil to a 6- to 8-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add meat, a portion  at a time, and cook until well browned on all sides. Add onion and garlic  and stir often until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes,  tomato sauce, chopped jalapenos, beer, oregano, pepper, cumin, paprika, and  ground pasilla chili; stir well. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and  simmer until meat is very tender when pierced, about 2-1/2 hours; stir  occasionally. If chili is thinner than you like, uncover and simmer until  some of the liquid evaporates. If its thicker, stir in water and bring to  boiling. Add salt to taste.
