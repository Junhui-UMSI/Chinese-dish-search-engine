Get all ingredients out so they can come to room temperature.  Preheat oven to 350F and oil an 8" or 9" cake pan.    Blend first 5 ingredients together in a blender until smooth.  Pour  into mixing bowl and sift next 3 ingredients on top of blended  mixture. Beat dry ingredients in well till all lumps are gone -- but  no longer. Be careful not to overmix.  Fold pineapple into batter and  pour into oiled cake pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, till a toothpick  inserted in the middle comes out clean. Remove from oven and allow to  sit in cake pan for about 15 minutes before turning onto a cooling  rack. Sprinkle entire surface of warm cake with shredded coconut and  allow to cool.    While cake is baking, mix coconut milk and arrowroot in a saucepan  till arrowroot dissolves.  Put pan on heat and stir constantly till  mixture boils and thickens.  Add juice concentrate and stir in,  continuing till mixture re-boils and thickens.  Remove from heat and  cool. Do the same in a separate pot with crushed pineapple and  arrowroot.    When cake, thickened pineapple and thickened coconut milk are cooled,  split cake in half so you have two layers.  Spread thickened coconut  milk over entire surface of cake like an icing.  Sprinkle entire  surface with shredded coconut and refrigerate till serving time.
