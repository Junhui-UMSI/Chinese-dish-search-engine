Put 2 Tbsp. oil into a very hot pressure cooker pot. Braise the beef  cubes on all sides until well browned.  Add the rest of the ingredients and  stir once to distribute ingredients evenly in pot.    Place lid on pressure cooker tightly.  Put pressure regulator weight in  place. Leave heat under cooker on high until the weight begins to jiggle.  Lower heat immediately to a level that keeps the weight just barely moving.  Time from this point on for 20-25 minutes (depending on the grade of meat).  Remove pot from heat and cool.    Open the lid and stir gently. Check the consistency of the gravy. If it  is too thin, raise the heat to high and reduce to the desired thickness. If  it is too thick, add a little water. My family especially likes this dish  served over baked macaroni and cheese with a side dish of peas, sauteed  with onions and pine nuts.
