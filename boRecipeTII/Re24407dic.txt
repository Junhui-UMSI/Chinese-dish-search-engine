Tropical Chicken Kebabs
Lemons, Curry powder, Butter, Pineapple Chunks In Juice, Boneless Skinless Chicken, 
Light a medium-hot fire in a barbecue grill or preheat the broiler. Cut the  chicken into 1" cubes. Youll have around 40. Drain the pineapple,  reserving the juice. Thread the chicken and pineapple chunks alternately on  skewers, allowing 2 of each per skewer. In small saucepan, melt the butter.  Squeeze the juice from half of 1 lemon into the butter and add the curry  powder and 2 tbsp of the reserved pineapple juice. Grill the chicken  skewers, basting frequently with the butter and turning occasionally, about  6 to 8 minutes total cooking time, until the chicken is golden brown  outside and white in the center but still moist. Or broil 3 to 4 inches  from the source of heat for about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the remaining  lemons into wedges and serve alongside.
