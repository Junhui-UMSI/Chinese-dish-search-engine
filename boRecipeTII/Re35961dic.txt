Source: _The Jewish-American Kitchen_ by Raymond Sokolov    Preheat the oven to 350:F.    Slice off the tops of the peppers and remove the cores. Place the peppers  in a large saucepan with water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for 5  minutes. Drain.    Carefully remove the ribs and seeds without puncturing the peppers (a  grapefruit knife is the tool of choice for this job).    Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl and use this mixture to stuff  the peppers. Stand the peppers upright in a 3-inch deep souffle dish or  other ovenproof ramekin that will hold them snugly. Pour about 1/2-inch of  water into the dish and bake for 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room  temperature.
