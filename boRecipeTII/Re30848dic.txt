Combine all ingredients in food processor or blender and process until  smooth and creamy.    Review by kjb2@postoffice.mail.cornell.edu (Kathy Brese): "I made this one  and IMHO it was pretty awful!  I really didnt like the flavor of the  ginger with the garbanzos.  I think my tastebuds expected cumin, not  ginger.  I did let it sit a few days to see if it needed time to mellow,  but it still tasted yucky to me." From: "Anne.Cox" <20676AC@msu.edu> "I  agree! We didnt like the ginger-garbanzo combo at all, and it got worse  and worse as it aged in the fridge...the raccoons climbed into the compost  to eat it, though. I didnt like the mushroom dip/puree thing at all,  either."    The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss From:  <aroesteg%exec.exec.uucp%rural@ALBNYDH2.bitnet>.
