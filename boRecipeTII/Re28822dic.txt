Put the tapioca pearls in a sieve and  rinse them very quickly under running water. Add them to the boiling water  and stir until they become translucent. Add the sugar to the tapioca and  water and stir until the sugar dussolves.    3. Remove the mixture from the heat and pour it into small custard cups or  an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking pan. Traditionally, the custard is poured into  banana leaves that have been formed into the shape of a cup.    4. Wash the soaked rice in 2 or 3 changes of water until the water runs  clear, and drain it well. Grind the uncooked rice with the salt, sugar, and  1 cup of the coconut milk until it is pureed.    5. Put the ground rice mixture into a pan with the remaining coconut milk.  Cook over medium heat until it thickens slightly. Reduce the heat to low  and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until it is very thick but still  pourable. If the mixture begins to dry out or gets too thick to pour, add  more coconut milk as needed.    6. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture evenly over the layer  of tapioca pudding.    7. Serve at room temperature. Makes 16 pieces.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
