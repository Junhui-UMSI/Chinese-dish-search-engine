Baked Whole Pumpkin
Cinnamon, Ginger, nutmeg, Eggs, Brown sugar, pumpkin, Butter, Whipping cream, Molasses, 
This dish was a favorite of George Washington. While it was called a pie  in the old days, its certainly not what we call a pie now. Here the  custard pie is found inside the pumpkin and the whole thing is to be served  up with a bit of anticipation for a very different pumpkin dessert.      Cut the lid off the pumpkin just as you would for a jack-o-lantern.  Remove the seeds and save for toasting later.      Mix the remaining ingredients together with the exception of the butter.  Fill the pumpkin with this mixture and top with the butter. Cover with the  pumpkin lid and place in a baking pan. Bake at 350? for 1 to 1-1/2 hours,  or until the mixture has set like a custard.       Serve from the pumpkin at your table, scraping some of the meat from the  pumpkin with each serving.       This is an interesting substitution for the usual pumpkin pie.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
