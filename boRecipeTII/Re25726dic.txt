Baba Ganouj (Eggplant Salad)
Black pepper; to taste, Green onion; minced, Garlic, olive oil, Lemon juice, Tahini, Salt, Eggplant, Parsley sprigs; minced, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut off the stem ends of the eggplant and  prick it all over with a fork. Place it directly on an oven rack and let it  roast until completely pooped (about 45 minutes). When it is sagging,  wrinkled, crumpled, and totally soft, youll know its ready. Remove it  from the oven, and let cool. Scoop the insides out and mash well. Combine  with rest of ingredients, except olive oil. Chill well. Drizzle the oil  over the top before serving. Serve with assorted crackers.
