In large mixer bowl, combine all cake  ingredients. Beat at low speed, scraping bowl often until all ingredients  are moistened. Beat at high speed, scraping bowl often until smooth (1-2  minutes). Pour into greased and floured 12-cup bundt pan or 10-inch tube  pan. Bake for 55-65 minutes or until wooden pick inserted into center comes  out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pan. Cool completely. In small  bowl, stir together powdered sugar and lemon juicee until smooth. Drizzle  over cake.    Note: Be careful when you drizzle the glaze--I managed to get the entire  counter sticky!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
