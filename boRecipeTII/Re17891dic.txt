Use an electric mixer and beat butter or margarine until soft. Add 3/4 cup  sugar and beat until fluffy. Add egg and vanilla or almond flavoring and  beat again. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together and add to  butter-sugar-egg mixture a little bit at a time. Divide the dough into 2  parts, wrap in plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to  get hard enough to play with like modeling clay. Then make small balls of  dough and roll into ropes. Shape the ropes into numbers or letters on an  ungreased cookie sheet, leaving a little space between them. Brush with a  little milk, sprinkle on a bit of sugar and bake at 375 degrees F for about       10    minutes.  Cool on a rack.
