In a large mixer bowl beat shortening and butter for 30 seconds or till  softened. Add sugar, spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat till  fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat thoroughly. Beat in flour. Stir in oats,  cherries or raisins, and orange peel. Generously fill a 1/3 cup dry measure  with dough and drop onto a greased cookie sheet. Press into a 4 inch  circle. Repeat with remaining dough, placing cookies 3 inches apart on  greased cookie sheets. Bake in a 375 oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till edges  are golden. Let stand for 1 minute. Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool.  Source: Better Homes and Gardens, February, 1995. NOTES  : These cookies taste best when golden around the edges and moist and chewy  in the center. To avoid overbaking, remove cookies from the oven when the  edges are golden and the centers still look slightly underdone    Recipe by: Sue Klapper    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Oct  20, 1998,
