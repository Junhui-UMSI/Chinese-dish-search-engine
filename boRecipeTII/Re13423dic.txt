Yeast Mini-Loaves
All-purpose floue (up, Coarse (kosher) salt, Egg, Water, Active dry yeast, Warm water, 
1. Sprinkle yeast over 1/4 cup of the warm water in a measuring cup. Gently  mix to moisted yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes to soften. Combine 3 1/2  cups of the flour and the salt in a bowl. Stir to mix well.    2. Pour yeast mixture into flour. Add remaining 1 cup water. Stir to form  ball. Add a little water if too dry, or flour if to wet. Knead dough on  lightly floured surface, with heel of hand, stretching dough away from you.    3.Fold dough back over on itself. Turn the dough a quater turn. Repeat the  kneading, pushing with heel of hand and folding back over, until dough is  smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 minutes.    4. Lightly grease a bowl with margarine. (I sprayed the bowl with cooking  spray.) Place the dough in the bowl turning it around in the bowl so it is  evenly coated. cover the bowl with a clean towel or a piece of plastic  wrap.    5 Let the dough rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in  volume, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.To test, lightly stick a finger in the dough. The  dent should slowly fill in when the finger is removed.    6. Punch dough down. Divide in half. On lightly floured surface, roll half  into 6-inch-long rope. Divide into thirds; shape into cigar-shapes. repeat  with other half.    7. Place mini-loaves on lightly greased (sprayed) baking sheets. If you  wish, cut slashes in top of each loaf with a thin knife.    8. Combine the egg and the 1 tablespoon water in a small cup. brush glaze  over mini-loaves. Sprinkle with poppy, sesame or other seeds, if you wish.    9. Bake the mini-loaves in preheated hot oven (400) for 25 minutes or until  gold brown and crusty. remove with spatula to wire rack to cool.
