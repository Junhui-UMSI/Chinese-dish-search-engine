Add the crushed chillies. Wash the  lemons and grate the colored rind or zest very finely, being sure not to  grate the tough white skin which will make the sauce bitter. If you use a  zester the fine threads of lemon can also serve as a garnish.    Cut the ham into fine matchsticks, and add to the garlic and butter. Heat  gently, then add the lemon rind and cream. Simmer uncovered for just under  an hour.    Heat a large pan of water and when it comes to the boil throw in the  tagliolini. Drain it immediately because this process is not to cook the  pasta, only to make it more flexible and less fragile.    Turn the sauce into a large pan and add the drained pasta. Cook the pasta  gently in the sauce for the required time, usually a very few minutes. Add  salt to taste. Add a little more cream if the sauce has become too dense,  but be careful not to "drown" the pasta.    Turn into a heated serving dish, decorate the top with fine threads of  lemon rind and serve at once.    Source: The Top One Hundred Pasta Sauces by Diane Seed.
