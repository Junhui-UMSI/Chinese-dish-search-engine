Tenderest stewing beef, Fresh herbs, Meat stock, Flour, salt and pepper, Dijon mustard, Clarified butter, Mushrooms, 
submitted by: tpogue@ids2.idsonline.com  A yummy stew - falls apart on the fork, easy to make and tender as they  come - also better the next day. We had it two nights ago. We love it!  Original main ingredient was veal, but I found veal dried out too fast so  substituted the stewing meat. We have something called cross-cut blade  steak here, which I use and its perfect! - Use your equiivalent tender  beef.    Preheat oven to 325. Tossed cubed beef in flour. (I put the whole mess into  a plastic bag) Brown in olive oil/butter. Place in a casserole dish. Toss  mushrooms in pan until lightly cooked and add to casserole with combined  meat stock and mustard. Stir. Scrape pan and add to casserole. Add salt and  pepper. Place tied herbs on top of meat    Cover and cook for two hours, stirring once during cooking. Remove herbs  before serving.
