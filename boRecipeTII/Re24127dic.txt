Mince two-three-four garlic cloves - as much as you like.    3. Add to 1 tbsp olive oil - not the best which is the darkest green you  can get, but a medium green to yellow color oil - in a smalll sauce pan.    4. Heat until the garlic is transparent.    5. Add one can (16-oz) MINCED tomatoes    6. Add one of the following depending on the sauce you want.       fresh oregano - about 1 sprig striped OR       fresh basil - same as above OR       1/2 lb browned hamburger (this makes Bolognese) and the oregano.    7. Cook until the pasta is al dente.    8. Drain the pasta and put in large flat pasta bowl.    9. Pour sauce over and sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesean.  Parmesean  grated more than 20 minutes loses its flavor.    8.  EAT - Bon appettit!! This is the ONLY traditional sauce I EVER came in  contact with during the five years we lived in Rome. Italians are appaled  by what Americans do to their food.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MealMaster recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
