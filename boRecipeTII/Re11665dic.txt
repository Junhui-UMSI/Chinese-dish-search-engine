Dissolve gelatin in 1 Tbsp. water.  Stir well and set aside.  Combine  remaining 2/3 c. water, vinegars and honey in small non-aluminum saucepan.     Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Remove from heat.  Gradually stir  in gelatin, cilantro and salt.  Cover and chill 8 hours.  Stir well before  serving.  Serves 16.  3 calories per serving.  0 g fat.  0% fat.     You could probably use kosher gelatin or agar agar to make this a vegan  dressing, but I havent tried that yet.  Let me know if you have success in  making this vegan.
