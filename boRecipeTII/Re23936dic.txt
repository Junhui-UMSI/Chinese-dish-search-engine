Asparagus au Gratin
Fresh asparagus, Butter, Flour, milk, Salt & freshly ground black, Nutmeg, Egg yolks, Grated Swiss cheese, 
Select a pan in which the asparagus will be able to lie flat. Add 1/2 inch water & bring to a boil. Wash asparagus thoroughly. Place in the boiling water; cover & cook 10 minutes. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan over  low heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Add milk & simmer 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Preheat broiler. When asparagus is done, drain & remove gently, so as not to break the tender tips, to a casserole dish.  Keep warm. When milk-roux mixture has cooked 10 minutes, season with salt, pepper & nutmeg. Remove from heat & blend in egg yolks thoroughly. Pour sauce over asparagus. Sprinkle with cheese & place under broiler only until cheese turns golden brown.
