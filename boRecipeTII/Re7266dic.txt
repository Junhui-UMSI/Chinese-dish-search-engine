Pork Chop Braised in Madeira and Cider
Sour cream (optional), Vegetable oil, Madeira, Salt, Granny Smith; sliced, 8 oz bone-in loin pork chop, Flour, Black Pepper, Vegetable oil, Apple cider, Onion; peeled and sliced, Coarsely shredded cabbage, 
DREDGE THE PORK CHOP IN FLOUR, patting to remove any excess flour. In a  small deep saute pan with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over  medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the pork chop and saute it  until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove the chop to a  plate and season it with salt and pepper. Discard the oil, add 2 more  teaspoons of oil and heat until hot. Add the apple slices, onion and  cabbage and saute them until they start to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in  the Madeira and cider. Bring the mixture to a boil and scrape up any  browned cooking bits. Reduce the heat so the liquid just simmers. Add the  pork, cover the pan and let the dish cook until the pork is tender, 40 to  60 minutes. Stir in the optional sour cream, if desired, season with salt  and pepper and serve.
