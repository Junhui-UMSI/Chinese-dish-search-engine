Pomodori Secchi Imbottoti ("Sun-Dried Tomato Sandwiches")
Garlic, finely minced, olive oil, salt and pepper, Red pepper flakes, Sun-dried tomatoes, Oregano, 
Ensure that the tomatoes are not overly salty.  Refresh them in warm  water to cover for about 10 minutes.  Soak them just long enough to  soften them, but be careful that they do not become soggy.  Drain &  pat dry.    Warm the olive oil in a small saute pan over very low heat.  Add the  garlic, red pepper flakes & oregano & warm for 5 to 8 minutes.  Be  careful not to let the garlic burn.  Season with salt & pepper to  taste.    Make the "sandwiches" by laying one tomato face down, drizzling a bit  of the herb-infused olive oil on it & covering with a second sun-dried  tomato.  Serve at room temperature.    Carol Field, "Italy in Small Bites"    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/vegan4.zip
