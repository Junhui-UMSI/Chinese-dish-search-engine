Three Berry Ice Pops
Cornstarch, Raspberries, Bing cherries, Fresh strawberries, Sugar, Cold water, 
Combine the strawberries, raspberries, and sugar in a medium saucepan. Let  the mixture stand until the sugar dissolves.  Cook over medium heat for 5  minutes.  Combine the cornstarch with the water and add to the berry  mixture.  Increase the heat to high, and stir constantly until thickened  and clear.  Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the cherries or  blueberries.    Makes 1 1/3 cups of sauce.    This recipe started out as "Three Berry Sauce," which was meant to be  served hot over "Cinnamon Raisin Toast."  Instead, I refrigerated it for  use over vanilla ice cream, and the leftovers got this treatment two days  later:    Puree sauce in a blender to desired smoothness (I left some small chunks).  Pour into ice-pop molds and freeze until solid.  Remove from freezer &  serve.  If necessary, run the ice pops under hot water for a bit, to loosen  from molds.    I got 6 small ice pops out of it.  Your mileage may vary.    Source: Lisa Clarke, based on a recipe in "The American Country Inn and Bed  & Breakfast Cookbook Volume Two" by Kitty & Lucian Maynard.    The Chefs Comments: "Here is something I made tonight - leftovers of the  best kind!  I havent tried them yet since theyre still hardening, but  Ill bet theyre good, and they were really easy to make, since the whole  step of making the sauce had already been done" - Lisa    From: Lisa Date: 08-19-96 (18:14) The Polka Dot Cottage, a BBS with a taste  of home. 1-973-822-3627    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #712 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  97
