Heat the butter or margarine and the oil in a 12-inch skillet over  medium-high heat until hot.  Add the beef and cook until most of the liquid  has been rendered and meat is browned on all sides, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the beef and keep warm.    Add the onion and red pepper strips to the skillet and cook until wilted,  about 3 minutes.  Return the beef to the skillet and add the blender  mixture. Heat to boiling, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered until  the beef is hot and the sauce is slightly thickened. Serve over rice or  stuffed into pitas, with rice on the side.
