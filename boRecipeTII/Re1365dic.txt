Easy Salsa Chicken Breasts
Chicken breast, Tomato salsa, Mustard, Brown sugar, 
This was in an advertisement for one of the salsas. I cannot remember the  exact ingredients, but go by looks and taste. Your measurements may vary.    Bake breasts at 350 degrees until almost done. Mix together remaining  ingredients and spoon over breasts. Bake until done.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Aug  31, 1998,
