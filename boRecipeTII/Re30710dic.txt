Tamatar Bhat (Tomato Pilaf)
Sweet Butter, Water, Ground coriander, Coarse salt, Light Vegetable Oil, Black pepper, (optional), Grated Or Sliced Daikon, Cooked Rice -- * see note, Fried Potatoes (See Below), To 1-1/2 Cup  Water, Onion, With Skin -- --or--, Red Ripe Tomatoes, Pureed, Or--, Radish For Garnish --, Canned Tomatoes -- pureed, 
* preferably day-old basmati rice.    1.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion  and cook, stirring until light brown (about 7 minutes)/ Add the coriander  and let sizzle for 25 to 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and the 1/2 cup  water, mix well, and cook over low heat, covered, for 15 minutes or until  reduced to pulpy sauce.    2.  Add salt, pepper, rice, and water.  Gently mix to fold the rice into  the sauce.  Add butter and fold to coat the rice evenly. Cover tightly and  steam the rice over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the sauce is  absorbed into the rice.  If you are garnishing the pilaf with fried  potatoes, you can begin making them now while the rice is cooking. Turn off  the heat, fluff the rice, and serve surrounded with fried potatoes or  grated or sliced daikon radish if desired.    Fried potatoes:    4 tablespoons light vegetable oil 1 pound potatoes, diced into 1/4-inch  pieces with skin    Note: I finally added some ghee to brown the potatoes, the vegetable oil  just didnt do it alone.    Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until it is very hot.  Add the potatoes and cook, turning and tossing, until they are browned and  cooked (20-25 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper  towels.    Note:  I folded Spicy Mushrooms with Ginger and Chilies into the Pilaf. It  was very good the first day and exceptional the second day    Recipe By     : Pat Gold <plgold@IX.NETCOM.COM>
