Whole Wheat Bread
Vegetable oil, Yeast, Salt, Warm water, Honey; molasses, or sugar, (2 to 4), Eggs, Whole wheat flour; (6 to 8), 
Hi, Im fairly new here, and thought it was time to come out of lurk mode!  Ive had great success making a whole wheat bread based on a recipe from  "Whole Foods for the Whole Family." Heres how I make it:    Dissolve yeast in warm water with 1 t. honey. After it bubbles up, add  remaining honey, salt, oil, and 3 c. of flour. Beat by hand 200 strokes  (this strengthens the gluten and makes the bread rise more easily). Add 1  more cup of flour and beat briefly.    Now you have the "sponge." Cover bowl and let sponge rise for about an hour  until doubled in bulk(I put the bowl on an old heating pad set on low, and  this works great).    Add eggs and remaining flour until a soft dough results. Knead for about  10-15 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until  doubled in bulk. Punch down the dough, shape into two loaves, and put in  two loaf pans. Let rise until doubled, then bake in 350 degree oven for 35  minutes.    If you try this, let me know how it works.
