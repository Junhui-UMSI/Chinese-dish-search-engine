Were just sorry we wont have an opportunity to  publish them all!    Drain artichoke hearts. A food processor may be used to chop the artichoke  hearts. Mix all ingredients together in a oven proof, small round casserole  dish. Place in pre-heated oven at 350-F degrees and bake about 20-25  minutes, or until top is brown and dip is hot and bubbly. Serve hot as a  dip with tortilla chips or sourdough bread slices. This is always a  favorite at every festivity!
