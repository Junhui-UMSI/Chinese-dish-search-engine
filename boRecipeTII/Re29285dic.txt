Baked Stuffed Peaches
Freestone peaches, Butter, Whole egg; beaten, Ground almonds, Marsala, Egg yolks or, Ground amaretti, Sugar, 
1.  Combine the sugar, ground almonds and amaretti.    2.  Gradually stir in the beaten egg, adding just enough egg so the mixture  holds together; dont let it become too wet to hold its shape.    3.  Form the mixture into 12 balls approx. the size of walnuts.    4.  Butter a shallow baking dish. Halve the peaches and remove the pits,  placing the halves cut-side up in the dish.    5.  Press a ball of the almond mixture into the cavity of each peach half.  Dot the tops with butter, and drizzle marsala over all.    6.  Bake at 190  F8C for around 30 mins. until the almond mixture is golden  and crusty. Serve warm or chilled.
