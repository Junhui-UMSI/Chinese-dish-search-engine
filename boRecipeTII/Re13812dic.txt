Wildfowl Stock
Bunch watercress, Or 3 stalks wild celery,, Wild carrots, chopped, Cold water, Game bird carcass, wings,, Wild onions, chopped, 
Place cold water in a soup pot.  Place game bird pieces in cold  water. Soak for 1 hour.  Add other ingredients.  Do not stir.  Soak  for 1 hour. Place pot, uncovered, at the back of a cook stove far  from the fire. On a conventional stove, place the pot on an asbestos  pad over very low heat.    Allow pot and its contents to warm very slowly.  You need to draw as  much as possible out of the ingredients and into the stock.  Skim off  scum as it rises.  When the pot is uniformly warm, move it closer to  the fire (or increase the heat) and very slowly and carefully bring  the liquid to a simmer.  Do not boil.  Do not rush.  Skim off all the  scum immediately, as it rises within the first 30 minutes of  simmering.  After 30 minutes and after skimming, use a clean piece of  cheesecloth to wipe the pot at the level of the liquid.    Simmer very gently, uncovered, for at least 3 hours.    Taking great care not to disturb the ingredients, carefully ladle the  liquid through clean, moistened cheesecloth into a large screw-lid  jar. Do not pour the stock.  Leave the unstrained stock uncovered  until cool. Cover cooled stock tightly and store in refrigerator.  Do  not remove grease at this time.    Skim grease from stock.  Reheat for use, or freeze.    This is from the cookbook on wild foods.  Ive copied as its written  because I found the style of writing and ingredients interesting. If  you try to use wild ingredients, be careful.  I seem to remember that  both wild onions and wild carrots have close relatives that look much  the same but are toxic.  Personally, Id do my stalking at the  supermarket.
