Reduce the heat to low and cook,  stirring often, until the liquid is reduced, about 1-1/2 hours. In a small  bowl, combine the cornmeal and 1/2 cup of water. Stir the cornmeal mixture  and the pink and black beans into the chili.Cook, stirring occasionally,  until the chili is thickened, about 10 minutes. (The chli can be made up to  3 days ahead. If desired, scrape off and discard the solidified fat that  rises to the surface. Reheat the chili gently on top of the stove before  serving.) Makes about 25 servings.
