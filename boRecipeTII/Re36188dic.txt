Its great for lazee people like me.    <grin>  Terri, I understand.  But this doesnt explain WHY you put your  autoexec.bat and config.sys in another directory. I have a buncha  subdirectories in my path statement, but the autoexec.bat and config.sys  are still in the root directory of my boot drive...  :)    Salad?
