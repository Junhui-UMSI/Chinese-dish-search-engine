Tortillas
Salt, Warm water (barely warm), White flour, Corn oil, 
This recipe I also took from FOODWINE, the person it was attributed to is  Asha Gupte, and it was a post for Indian food, but I changed it slightly,  and now its tortillas.  =)    Dissolve slat in warm water.  Set aside.    Mix oil and flour together until "mealy", drizzle warm water slowly into  flour mixture.  Form soft, stiff ball.  Dust dough ball with flour and  knead another minute.  Rest 30 minutes, uncovered (NOTE from A: I cover  mine).    Pinch off 12-15 pieces and form into balls.  Roll ball in hand and smooth  out edges.  With the heel of your hand, make 4" circles.  Let rest another       30    minutes.    Dredge with flour on both sides.  Roll out dough into 8" (roughly) circle.  Working with short, even strokes, roll from center to edge of circle,  making a turn after 2-3 strokes.  Place on hot, ungreased skillet.  Cook  for one minute per side, or until "done" (NOTE from A: this is the hardest  step to describe if you arent familiar with tortillas, then I would  suggest until the color has changed slightly).    More NOTES from A: I usually roll out the next tortilla while the previous  one is in the process of cooking, but it can get dangerous if you turn away  from the cooking tortilla too long.    Cinnamon/Sugar Tortillas    Prepare a cinnamon/sugar mixture to your own taste. Rub a still warm  tortilla with margarine, sprinkle with the mixture, roll up, and enjoy.    There is a slightly different version, which is much less healthful, and  not so easy... Deep fry tortillas. As soon as they come out, sprinkle with  cinnamon/ sugar mixture and serve.
