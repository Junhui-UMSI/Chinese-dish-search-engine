Barbecued Zucchini
Zucchini, Italian salad dressing, Salt and pepper to taste, 
SERVES 6-8      I like vegetables as much as I do meat, perhaps more. There is no reason  why you cannot put something into your barbecue cooker other than potatoes  and meat. Try this one. Even your children will eat their vegetables.      Trim the ends of the squash and cut each lengthwise in half and then each  piece into quarters. Marinate in the salad dressing for 1/2 hour before  cooking. Place on the charcoal grill and add salt and pepper to taste.  These pieces should cook in very little time, so watch them. Nobody likes  soggy zucchini!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
