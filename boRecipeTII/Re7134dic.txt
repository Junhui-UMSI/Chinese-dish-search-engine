From: lull@acm.org (John Lull)    Date: Sun, 01 Oct 95 03:02:58 GMT  This is a recipe I obtained from a dental patient over 25 years ago.  We  had a recipe exchange for our Thursday evening patients. The gal who gave  me the recipe liked to cook just as much as I do, so enjoy her recipes.    Soak the poppy seed in the milk overnight in the refrigerator.  The  following day - Cream well the sugar and butter. Add beaten egg.    Sift together flour and baking power.  Add to creamed mixture.  Then  gradually add vanilla.  Mix in the soaked poppy seed mixture.  Bake in loaf  or flat pan in moderate oven at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.
