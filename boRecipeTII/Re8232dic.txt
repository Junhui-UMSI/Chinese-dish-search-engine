Potato Latkes (Potato Pancakes)
Salt, Baking Powder, Flour, Egg, Onion, Potatoes, 
Wash, pare and grate raw potatoes.  Strain but not too dry, and use juice  for soup or sauce.  If juice is retained, a little more flour will be  needed for thickening. Grate and add the onions; add salt and the egg. Beat  well.  Mix reamining ingredients and beat into potatoes; mix well. Drop by  spoonfuls into hot fat that is deep enough to almost cover the cake. Brown  on both sides.  Drain on absorbent paper.  Serve with applesauce, if  desired.
