1. Put the almond biscuits and 50g of the amaretti or ratafia biscuits into  a polythene bag and crush, or use a food processor. Melt butter in a pan,  add biscuits and stir. Press into the base and up sides of a 23cm/9in  loose-base flan tin, about 4cm/1 1/2 in deep.    2. Make up the jelly to 300ml/ 1/2 pint with boiling water. Stir until  dissolved. Blend 450g/1 lb. of strawberries in a food processor until  smooth. Mix with the jelly and apple juice and leave until mixture is on  the point of setting. Turn into flan case, chill until set.    3. Roughly crush the remaining biscuits and meringue and slice the rest of  the strawberries. Whip the cream until peaking, fold in the strawberries,  biscuits and meringue. Pile over the tart and sprinkle with any biscuit  crumbs. Chill tart until it is needed - remove from tin to serve.    NOTES : Everyone loves strawberries and cream and this has to be the  ultimate combination, encased in a crisp almond biscuit crust. Tip: Stir  1-2 tbsp of your favourite liqueur into the cream for a real treat - why  not try Grand Marnier or Kirsch.
