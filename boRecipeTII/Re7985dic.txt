Heat the  butter in a heavy saucepan and cook the leeks and onions until soft and  yellow.  Add the potatoes, salt, and pepper and just cover with water. Boil  until the potatoes are soft.  Force the potatoes through a food mill or  strainer or process in food processor or blender until smooth.  Combine  with the chicken broth, using a wire whisk to completely blend the  combination. Reheat the soup, adding the cream. Season to taste. Serves 6    EAT-L DIGEST 15 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
