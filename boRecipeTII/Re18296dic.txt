Heat a dry comal or flat iron griddle over moderately low heat until hot  and pan-roast garlic and tomato, turning them occasionally to ensure even  roasting, until browned and soft throughout, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Discard garlic skins and tomato stem. In a heavy skillet heat oil over  moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and, using tongs, fry  chiles, 1 or 2 at a time, turning them, until puffed and just beginning to  brown, about 10 seconds. Transfer chiles as fried, letting excess oil drip  into skillet, to paper towels to drain and, wearing rubber gloves, discard  stems. In a blender pur?e garlic, tomato, chiles, water, and salt until  very smooth. (Salsa may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered.) Makes  about 2 cups. Serves 4.
