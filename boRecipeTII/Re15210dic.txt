Whipped Cream Pecan Cinnamon Rolls
Light brown sugar, All-purpose flour, Pecans, Whipping cream, Salt, Whipping cream, Butter, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, 
In a medium mixing bowl whip the cream until soft peaks form. Gently blend  in the flour, baking powder and salt until a dough is formed. On lightly  floured board, knead 10 to 12 times. Roll out into a1/4" thick rectangle.  Spread the melted butter over the entire surface. Sprinkle with cinnamon  and sugar, the amount your preference. Roll up like a jelly roll: Starting  at long end. Cut into 3/4-inch segments. Place on a greased baking sheet  and bake at 425F for 10-15 minutes, or until very lightly browned.    In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, pecans and 2 Tablespoons whipping  cream until well-blended. Remove the rolls from the oven. Spread the  topping on each roll. Return to the oven and bake until the topping starts  to bubble, approximately 5 minutes.    Makes 12 to 15 rolls    *Note*    A lot of children dont like nuts. If this is the case with yours, try  substituting raisins for the nuts, or just spread with the cinnamon and  sugar.
