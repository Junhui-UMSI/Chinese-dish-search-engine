Cranberry Orange Pineapple Relish
Whole navel orange, crushed pineapple, mandarin orange, cranberries, Sugar, 
This is not ordinarily messy to make, but as with beets and tomato dishes,  Im careful with what I prepare cranberries.    1. Put orange in cuisinart with metal blade and pulse or process till  coarsely chopped.    2. Add cranberries to food processor and pulse or chope till coarsely  chopped. (If cranberries are still frozen, this will make a lot of noise.)    3. Empty into a container that can be covered and refrigerated.    4. Drain cans of orange segments and crushed pineapple and put aside juices  for some other use. Stir canned fruit into cranberries. Add sugar to taste.  Flavor will improve while the relish chills. (When my mother first showed  me how to make this, she used to use 2 whole cups of sugar but now she just  uses 1 cup)    5. Refrigerate.
