Phyllo Cheese Pastries
Eggs, butter, Chopped parsley, Muenster cheese, phyllo dough, 
Grate the muenster cheese finely in a food processor or with a hand  grater. Add eggs & parsley & blend well. Remove the phyllo dough from  the freezer & gently unroll. With a sharp knife, slice dough into  thirds, lengthwise, so that each is approximately 4" x 12". Re-wrap  two thirds of the dough in plastic & return to the freezer. Tear a  large piece of wax paper & place on counter. Working quickly, take  one sheet of phyllo dough & brush liberally with butter. Top with two  more sheets of phyllo, brushing each with butter. Place approximately  1 Tbls. of cheese mixture at one end of the buttered sheets, 1" from  the edge. With your fingers, roll the dough over the cheese mixture  twice. Fold in the edges of the dough & continue rolling tightly  until the end. (Be careful not to tear the dough or roll too loosely,  otherwise the cheese will spill out when baking). Place seam side  down on a cookie sheet & brush tops with butter. Repeat with  remaining phyllo sheets. Bake at 400 degrees for approximately 15  minutes or until golden & crispy.
