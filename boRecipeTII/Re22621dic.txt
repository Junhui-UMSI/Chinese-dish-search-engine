Mix crust ingredients together and press into bottom and against  sides of a 9 inch springform pan. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 10  minutes. Cool before filling. Drain apricots, saving syrup. Sprinkle  gelatin over cold water in top of double boiler; let stand 5 minutes.  Mix in lightly beaten egg yolks and 1/4 cup apricot syrup. Place over  hot water; cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 10  minutes. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and cool to lukewarm.  Meanwhile, puree 2 cups apricot halves to get a measure of 1 1/2  cups. Save remaining 1/2-3/4 cup apricot halves for topping. Beat egg  until it forms a stiff meringue. Set aside. With same beater, beat  cream cheese with egg yolk mixture and pureed apricots. Fold in  meringue; pour into crust. Chill several hours until firm. While cake  is chilling, prepare Apricot Glaze. Combine all ingredients in a  saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a boil  and thickens. Cool slightly before glazing cheesecake. Trim top of  cake with remaining apricot halves and the Apricot Glaze.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
