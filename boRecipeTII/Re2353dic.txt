Beef Kreplach
Celery Stalk, Lukewarm water, MEAT FILLING, Boneless Chuck Or Brisket, Garlic, Vegetable oil, Salt, Carrott, Onions, DOUGH, Vegetable oil, Salt, Flour, 
Season the meat with salt and pepper; rub with the garlic. Place in a  heaavy pot and surround with the carrot, celery an 1 onion. Cook covered  for about one hour or until there is almost no liquid. Add water to cover  and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. While the meat is cooking, slice the remaining  2 onions and saute slowly in oil until brown. Remove the meat from heat and  let cool. Drain and coarsely grind with all the onions, adding a little  broth from the meat if needed to make it moist enough to handle.    Dough: Mix the oil, salt and water in a bowl. Gradually stir in the flour  until a medium soft dough is formed. Place on a floured board. Knead until  the doughis smooth and soft. A food processor will work fine for this. Cut  the dough into 3 portions. Roll each piece into a rectable about 1/8 inch  thick. Cut into 2 inch squares.    Fill each square with about 1 tsp of the meat mixture. Dipping your hands  in flour, fold over into a triangle, and then crimp closed. Join the two  ends together like a little ring, as with tortellini or wontons. Repeat  with the rest of the kough. If you like, you can freeze the kreplach at  this point. Place on a cookie sheet in a single layer and freeze. Transfer  to plastic freezer bags. Otherwise, refrigerate until ready to use.    To cook the kreplach, bring about 10 cups of water to a boil in a big pot.  Add salt and about 20 kreplach at a time. When the kreplach have risen to  the top, cook for another 5 minutes (al dente). Remove with a strainer into  a bowl filled with chicken soup.
