TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH 6219    Mash the butter together with the lemon zest and set aside. In a large  heavy skillet heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the jalapeno, pine  nuts, lima beans, water, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil,  stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat so that the liquid is  simmering. Simmer uncovered for about 8 minutes, until the beans have  absorbed all the liquid. If the beans are still not tender and they have  absorbed all the water, add a little more hot water. When the beans are  tender, stir in the green onions and remove from the heat. Stir in the  lemon butter and the mint, taste for seasoning, and serve immediately.    Yield: 6 servings    Note: To toast pine nuts, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the nuts  on a cookie sheet and toast in the oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Set  aside to cool.
