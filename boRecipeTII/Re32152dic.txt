Place them in a large pot and pour in the  water.  Add the vinegar, onions, green peppers, red pepper, salt, and black  pepper.  Heat to boiling over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to simmering  and cook, covered, until just about tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Skim the  surface and stir the pigs feet occasionally during cooking.    2.  Preheat the oven to 350 degree F.  Remove the pigs feet from the broth  with a slotted spoon.  (Reserve the broth for cooking greens or  vegetables.) Arrange them side by side in 2 baking pans large enoughto hold  them in a single layer. Spoon the barbecue sauce over them and bake 15  minutes. Reduce the heat to 300 degree F. and continue cooking until  tender, about 35 minutes.
