Tabil (Tunisian Spice)
Coriander seeds, Caraway seeds, Dried crushed chill, Garlic, 
This mixture is specific to Tunisia. Tabil means coriander, but generally  refers to this blend of ingredients.    Pound all the ingredients in a mortar, then dry in a preheated oven at 200  degrees for about half an hour. When quite dry, grind to a fine powder and  keep in an airtight jar for up to 4 months.
