*Matzots and mastza meal may be bought in Jewish grocery stores and many  supermarkets *The recipe calls for cubes of turkey breast to be ground;  however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be acceptable    Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them. In a  large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute, stirring frequently  until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried sage is used, enclose it  in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you using ground turkey, add garlic  and bay leaf to this cheesecloth bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool.  Remove and discard bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to  saucepan with oil and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid from  the matzot, but do not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the saucepan and  turn heat off. If using cubed turkey breast, grind it now and return to the  saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly. Oil a 9 inch cake pan and  sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture into it; level it with a  spatula. With a small ladle, make three depressions near the centre and  place 1 egg yolk in each depression. Bake in 375F oven for 1/2 hour.
