Avocado Stuffed with Smoked Fish (West Africa)
olive oil, Vegetable oil, avocados, Sugar, Smoked whitefish, Salt, eggs *, fresh lime juice, fresh red bell, milk, 
* the yolks rubbed through a sieve and the whites finely chopped.    ** each cut about 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long.    In a deep bowl, mash the egg yolks and milk together with a spoon or  table fork until they form a smooth paste.  Add 1 tablespoon of the  lime juice, the sugar and the salt.    Then beat in the vegetable oil, a teaspoon or so at a time; make sure  each addition is absorbed before adding more.  Add the olive oil by  teaspoonfuls, beating constantly.  Stir the remaining lime juice into  the sauce and taste for seasoning.    With your fingers or a small knife, remove the skin from the fish and  pick out any bones.  Drop the fish into a bowl and flake it finely  with a fork. Add the chopped egg whites and the sauce, and toss  together gently but thoroughly.    Just before serving, cut the avocados in half.  With the tip of a  small knife, loosen the seeds and lift them out.  Remove any brown  tissue like fibers clinging to the flesh.    Spoon the fish mixture into the avocado halves, dividing it equally  among them and mounding it slightly in the center.  Arrange 3 strips  of sweet pepper or pimiento diagonally across the top of each avocado  and serve at once.    Makes 4 servings.
