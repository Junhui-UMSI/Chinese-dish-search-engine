As promised, heres what I made for Christmas dessert. The chocolate  ganache layer between the crust and mousse filling really makes this. I  topped the finished product with red and green sprinkles instead of cookies  crumbs. Enjoy!    For crust: Butter 10" diameter springform pan with 2 3/4" high sides.  Finely grind cookies in processor. Add melted butter and blend until  combined. Press crust mixture into bottom of prepared pan. Bring cream to  simmer in heavy medium saucepan. Reduce heat to low. Add chocolate and  whisk until melted and smooth. Pour chocolate mixture over crust. Chill.    For filling: Combine white chocolate and 1 cup cream in top of double  boiler. Stir over simmering water until melted and smooth. Remove from over  water. Cool to barely lukewarm.    Sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup water in heavy small saucepan. Let stand 5  minutes to soften. Stir over low heat until gelatin dissolves. Pour into  large bowl. Add 2 remaining cups cream and vanilla and stir to combine.  Beat cream-gelatin mixture to soft peaks. Fold in white chocolate mixture.  Pour filling into crust. Refrigerate until filling is set, at least 6 hours  or overnight.    Run a small, sharp knife around pan sides to loosen torte. Release pan  sides. Sprinkle top with chopped cookies.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Patricia Williams <pie@GOODWILL.ORG> on Jan 7,  1998
