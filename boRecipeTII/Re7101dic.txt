Poppy Seed Muffins
Poppy seeds, Salt, Whole wheat pastry flour, milk, Unbleached white flour, Sunflower oil, Baking Powder, Honey, Eggs, 
Preheat oven to 375.  Heat poppy seeds and 1 1/3 cup milk, bring it to a  boil (I use the microwave to heat it). Let it cool 20 minutes. Combine  cooled poppy seed mixture with the other liquids, including the remaining  milk, and the eggs.  In a large bowl, combine the flours, salt, and baking  powder. Add liquids to dry ingredients. Stir until they are just moist.  Fill buttered muffin tins 2/3 full.  Bake 20 minutes. FROM: KATHLEEN SHAW  (HWGP25A)
