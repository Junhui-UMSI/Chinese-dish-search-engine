Baked Apples Stuffed with Mascarpone
Dried currants, Apples, Dark brown sugar, Brandy, Walnuts, Mascarpone, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Core the apples, leaving the bottoms intact.  Peel off the skin around the top, leaving two-thirds of the apple unpeeled.  Use a grapefuit spoon to hollow out about a 1 1/2-inch wide by 2 1/2-inch  deep pocket in the center of each apple.    Place the currants and brandy in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a  simmer and remove from the heat. Pour the currants and brandy into a small  bowl and let cool. When cool, mix in the mascarpone, walnuts and brown  sugar. Fill the pockets of the apples with the stuffing and place the  apples in a shallow baking pan. Add about 1 inch of water. Bake until the  apples are tender, about 30 minutes. Serve the stuffed apples warm or cold.    Source: "Starbucks Passion for Coffee".
