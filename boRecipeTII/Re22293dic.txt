This is very much like my recipe in an earlier book for Chicken Piccata,  but in this case I use sliced turkey breast. It is now readily available in  most supermarkets, and since it is low in fat and there is no waste, I  recommend it for regular eating. Dont overcook this and you will be very  pleased with the results.      Using a wooden or metal meat pounder, pound the meat a bit between a  heavy plastic sheet until the slices are about double their former size.  Salt and pepper each, and dust with a bit of the flour. Dip into the egg  wash and then into the crumbs, which have been placed on a plate.      Fry two pieces at a time in a bit of the oil. Cook only 2 or 3 minutes on  each side, as you want them lightly browned, not dry. Remove and keep warm  on a platter.      Deglaze the pan with the wine. Add the capers and lemon juice, and reduce  for a minute. Pour over the turkey and garnish with the parsley and lemon  slices.      For a special addition, try adding some crushed garlic to the pan just  before you deglaze it. Delicious!      Since this is a quick one, I would serve it with a nice green salad,  rolls, and a dry white wine. Thats enough!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
