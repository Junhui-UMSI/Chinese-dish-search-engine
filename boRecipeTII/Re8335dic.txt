Place all ingredients into bread machine. Program for dough and press  start. At the end of the cycle, punch down the dough and turn out onto a  lightly floured board. Divide dough and allow to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.  Divide each half of dough into 12 even pieces. Turn the ball of dough  inside out and pinch the ends together on the bottom. This will give you a  smooth ball. Place seam side down on ungreased cookie sheet (if your cookie  sheet looks like its seen better days, spray a thin layer of nonstick  spray). You can either have sides touching for soft-sided rolls or not  touching for more "crusty" rolls. Allow to rise 30 - 40 minutes or until  doubled. Bake in an oven preheated to 425 for 15 to 18 minutes or until of  desired browness.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #003 by Suzy <suzy@bestweb.net> on Jan 2,  1998
