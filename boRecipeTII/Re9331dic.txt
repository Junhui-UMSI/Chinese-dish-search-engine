Puffed Shrimp Sandwiches
Shredded monterey jack or, Mayonnaise, (small) shrimp (I add a few, Green onions, sliced,, Dried or fresh dill to taste, 
Mix all ingredients together. Spread thickly on toasted English muffin  halves and broil until puffed, brown and bubbly. Serve open-faced,  garnished with a sprig of dill.    I dont know how many sandwiches this makes (its actually an adaptation of  an hors doeuvre recipe), but it makes a lot.    Serve with a simple but piquant green salad (the sandwiches are rich) and a  lemon tart. Posted to FOODWINE Digest 14 Apr 97 by Nancy Brandt  <Nancy.Brandt@UCOP.EDU> on Apr 14, 1997
