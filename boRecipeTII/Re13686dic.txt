Add 4 cups fresh water and salt, and bring to a boil.  Cook, covered, at a simmer until the grains are swollen and tender, but  still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Pour the cooked rice into a colander  and let it drain briefly. While the rice is cooking, toast the hazelnuts in  the oven, 7 to 10 minutes, or until they smell toasty. Let them cool a few  minutes; then rub them in a small kitchen towel to remove most of the  skins. Dont worry about any flecks of skins that wont come off. Roughly  chop the hazelnuts, leaving the pieces fairly large. Rinse the currants in  warm water and squeeze them dry; then cover them with the orange juice and  let them soak until needed. Prepare the vinaigrette. Add the soaked  currants and the fennel to the warm rice, and toss with the dressing. Just  before serving, cut the apple into small pieces, add it to the rice, along  with the hazelnuts, and toss. Season with freshly ground black pepper, and  additional salt, if needed, and serve.
