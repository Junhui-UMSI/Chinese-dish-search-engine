Apple and Caramel Pudding
Soft brown sugar, Butter, Suet, Cold Water to mix, Salt, Self-Raising Flour, Cooking Apples, 
Butter the pudding basin thickly with the ounce of butter, then press in 3  ounces of the sugar. Mix the flour, salt and suet together. Add just enough  cold water to make a soft. but not sticky dough. Do not overwork or you  will get tough pastry. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry and line the  buttery, sugary basin. Slice in the peeled and cored apples. Sprinkle in  the last ounce of sugar. Make a circle for a lid with the last of the  pastry. Moisten the edges to make a firm seal, pinching the two layers of  pastry together well. Trim any surplus. Cover with a double layer of  greaseproof and steam for two hours. Turn out your pudding for service and  a caramel sauce will be coating the outside.    Source: Lakeland Plastics
