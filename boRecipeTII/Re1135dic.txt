Cranberry Relish
(1 pound) fresh cranberries;, Oranges; peeled and chopped,, Apples; chopped **, up to 3, Walnuts; chopped ***, (soupsize) of pineapple;, 
* (you will have to buy the cranberries ahead of time and put them in the  freezer) they should still have some ice crystals in the them when you chop  them - they will make a lot of noise in the food processor if they are too  frozen    ** (I use granny smith or macintosh) (peeled or unpeeled doesnt make any  difference)    *** (if my mother in law isnt going to eat it, I put in another 1/2 c of  walnuts)    Here is my cranberry relish recipe - I "invented" it for my mother in law  who has Type II diabetes. I would imagine there are others similar to this,  but I havent seen one without sugar...    She figures about 1/2 cup serving = a fruit exchange    Put everything in a bowl to blend flavors. This can be made a day or two  ahead. In fact, it is even better when it is made ahead of time. Keep in  the frig until read to use.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Maura E.
