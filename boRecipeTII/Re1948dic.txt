Source: Bon Appetit-November 1998    Place large baking sheet on oven rack and preheat to 350 degrees. Whisk  sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, vanilla extract and salt in  large bowl to blend. Whisk in eggs. Stir in shredded coconut, chocolate  chips and pecans. Pour filling into frozen pie crust. Place pie on baking  sheet in oven; bake until crust is golden brown and filling is set in  center; about 40 minutes. Transfer pie to rack and cool slightly.    This is really delicious!!! As a matter of fact, this months Bon Appetit  has some great sounding recipes and as I try them and see how they come  out, I will submit them.
