Tabasco Chile Sauce
Vinegar, chiles de Arbol, Water, 
I made a really simple chile sauce last summer that now is my favorite  seasoning for eggs, vegetables and main dishes. I make it a little thicker  than you want (on the order of Pickapeppa or A1) but you could easily add  more vinegar and water to resemble Tabasco.    What I did was take about 2 pounds of ripened Chile de Arbol peppers and  wash and chop off the stems. Then chop them up coarsely and put in a  stainless steel saucepan. Cover with a 50-50 mixture of vinegar and water  and boil for 3-4 hours, adding more liquid as necessary. Make sure you have  adequate ventilation: this combination will absolutely *stop* your  respiration if you get more than a few minutes of it.    After youve boiled it, pour the whole mixture into a food processor or  blender and puree. Cook it down to the thickness you want and put it in a  bottle. Refrigerate.    The de Arbols give it a nice, small (but pungent) amount of heat and I  think it tastes better than Tabasco sauce, especially on eggs. Its kept  beautifully in my refrigerator. I imagine several other types of peppers  would produce a nice sauce like this as well.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
