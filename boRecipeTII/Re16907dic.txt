Make a dark roux with olive oil and flour.  When roux is dark brown, add  onion, green onion, bell pepper, and celery; cover and cook until onions  are clear, stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes and continue cooning for 10  min; stir often. Add water and stir to make a thick liquid. Add garlic,  Worcestershire, lemon juice, salt, hot sauce, wine, and tomato sauce,  making sure to mix well. Add alligator, and enough water to cover the  ingredients by 2 inches; stir to mix. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  After it comes to a boil, turn heat to low and cover, checking from time to  time, and stir to prevent sauce from sticking. Continue cooking for 3 to 4  hrs. until meat is tender. Serve over cooked rice or spaghetti with  Parmesan cheese. Freeze leftovers in serving size containers.    This recipe is for a party--no one would go to this much trouble if the  recipe only fed 4 peoples.
