In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients.  Make a well in the center  and add in remailing ingredients.  Mix well (use an electic mixer if you  want your cake especially light).  Bake in a Pam sprayed 8 or 9 inch square  pan at 350F (180 C) for 30-35 minutes or until toothpick-test done.* I  didnt use a frosting-it was very moist and yummy without. If you must, you  could mix ff cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar and frost with that.    *insert toothpick into center of cake.   If it comes out clean, the cake is  done.
