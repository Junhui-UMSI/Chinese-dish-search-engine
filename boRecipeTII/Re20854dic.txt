Place 1/3 of the apples in the bottom of a deep square baking dish (glass).  Sprinkle with some cinnamon and brown sugar.  Place 1/3 of the pre-cooked  noodles on top.    Mix the cheeses and egg white with the 1/2 cup brown sugar and some  cinnamon and nutmeg. Spread 1/2 on top of the noodles, then top with more  apples and another layer of noodles.    Repeat apple/cheese/noodles until you use them all up.  Top layer should be  noodles with a few apple slices for garnish.  Sprinkle with some cinnamon.  Pour apple cider over lasagna.    Cover with wax paper or plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH for 10-15  minutes or until noodles are tender. Allow to sit to absorb moisture.    ALternately, I guess this can be baked in the oven (350 for 1/2 hour or so,  covered with foil).
