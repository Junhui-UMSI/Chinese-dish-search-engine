In a non-stick skillet, cook the ground turkey over medium heat until  cooked through and no longer pink in the center.    2.  In a Dutch oven or small stockpot, saute onions and pumpkin in olive  oil over medium heat until soft, about 10 minutes.    3.  Add cooked turkey and remaining ingredients, bring to a boil and turn  heat down to low.  Simmer 40 minutes.  Adjust seasonings to suit your  taste.  Serves 6.    Notes:    1.  Cut the pumpkin cubes the same size as the bean being used.    2.  To roast pumpkin pieces, first cut pumpkin in half.  Scoop out  the  seeds and stringy pulp.  Place the halves skin side up and shave off the  skin.  Use a sharp chefs knife and always cut away from you.  Cut the  peeled pumpkin into slices, then into 1/2-inch cubes (see note 1). Place on  a well-oiled cookie sheet, sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast at 400  degrees for 1/2 hour or until tender, tossing occasionally.    Notes by Tony Lima:    That sounds like a heck of a lot of salt!    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #139    Date: Wed, 23 Oct 1996 11:00:00 -0700    From: tony.lima@toadhall.com (Tony Lima)
