Cook 2 cups brown or white rice in 3 cups boiling water until tender. (This  will take 15-20 minutes for white, and 35-35 minutes for brown.) Fluff the  cooked rice with a fork and set aside. Trim the tough bottoms from the  broccoli stalks and cut the tops into smallish spears of whatever size  suits you. Cook them in a steamer over boiling water until bright green and  just barely tender. Rinse under cold running water, drain well and set  aside. Preheat oven to 325F. Lightly grease a 9X13-inch baking pan. Melt  the butter or heat the oil in a large, deep skillet or a Dutch oven. Add  the onion and salt and saute over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until  the onion begins to soften. Add the garlic and lemon juice and saute for  about 2 minutes longer. Stir in the rice, some black pepper and cayenne to  taste, the herbs and the optional sunflower seeds and/or cheese. Taste to  correct salt, if necessary and spread into prepared pan. Now for the fun  part. Arrange the broccoli upright in the rice, and, if desired, drizzle  with melted butter. Cover loosely with foil and bake until just heated  through (15-20 minutes). Serve right away.    Recipe from THE ENCHANTED BROCCOLI FOREST, by Mollie Katzen ? 1982, used  with permission of Ten Speed Press; CompuCooks Recipe Collection.
