Cut the beef into small thin slices and rub these with the salt and 1/2  tablespoon of oil.  Mix the soy sauce, cornstarch, water, sherry and stock  in a bowl until well blended. Finely chop the ginger. Heat the oil in a  frying pan. When hot add the beef, spreading the pieces out, and stir-fry  them over a high heat for 1 minute. Add the ginger, followed by the oyster  sauce and sugar, and continue to stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the sauce  mixture from the bowl, and continue to stir-fry over a high heat for a  further minute.  Serve immediately on a well-heated dish. This mixture of  seafood flavor with meat is a common Cantonese practice which most  southerners enjoy, but which is not always accepted in central and north  China.
