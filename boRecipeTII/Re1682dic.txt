Precook Millet. Bring water to a boil by itself first. Then add 1  Tablespoon margarine and sprinkle in the millet. Stir briefly, and  partially cover. Turn heat to low.    Cook the millet for 15 to 20 minutes only!!! Stir with a fork halfway  through cooking and again at the end. This time, it is desirable that the  trapped steam escape, otherwise it will keep cooking the millet even after  it is removed from the direct heat. So fluff it with a fork, A LOT, after  it is cooked, and leave it uncovered. This is the best deterrent to  mushiness. Add salt after it is cooked    Preheat oven to 350? and spray cooking oil into a 9X13-inch pan.    saute mushrooms & onion in margarine in a large pot for 5 minutes. Add  garlic, basil, salt, pepper and cauliflower to pan and cook 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and add all other ingredients. Mix well and pour into  prepared pan. Dust with Paprika.    Bake 1/2 hour at 350.
