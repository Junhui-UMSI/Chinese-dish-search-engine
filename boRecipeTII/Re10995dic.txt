1. To make the Petal Butter: Whip together the softened butter and sour  cream in a small bowl until well incorporated and fluffy. Then fold in the  dill and chopped, edible flower petals.    2. To assemble sandwiches: Thinly slice radishes with a sharp knife or a  Japanese mandoline.** With a serrated knife slice the baguette into thin,  1/8- to 1/4-inch slices. (You should have 24 to 26 slices. Extra bread can  be saved for another use.)    3. Spread each bread slice with petal Butter, then top with slices of  radish. Place sandwiches on a platter and sprinkle a few edible flower  petals over sandwiches, if desired.    Chefs Notes: *Borage, Johnney-Jump-Ups, calendula and rose petals make a  pretty petal combination for this recipe. It is always very important to  know that the petals youre using are edible and have not been sprayed.  Gourmet grocers or farmers markets usually carry edible petals in the  spring and summer. **A Japanese mandoline is a handy slicing machine that  makes very thin-sliced or matchstick vegetables. Well-stocked Asian markets  carry this tool.    Copyright 1997 by Kathy Casey.
