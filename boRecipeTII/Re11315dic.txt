Ranch Linguini W/chicken (Or Shrimp)
Grated Parmesan cheese, Linguini, chicken, mixed veggies, Ranch dressing, 
Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan and toss well. Heat through and  sprinkle with cheese before serving. Yields: 4 servings. (I put all of my  ingredients inside of a large casserole dish and baked for 20 minutes on      350    degrees).
