With meat mallet or bottom of heavy saucepan, pound each chicken breast  half to 1/2-inch thickness between two pieces of waxed paper.  Cut breast  lengthwise into 1-inch wide strips.  In bowl or plastic storage bag, place  chicken and remaining ingredients;mix well.    Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, stirring or turning bag  occasionally (the longer the marinating time the spicier the chicken).    Thread chicken strips on metal or bamboo skewers.  If using bamboo skewers,  soak in water to prevent charring when broiling. Brush generously with  marinade.    Broil or grill 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until chicken is done and  tender, brushing with marinade frequently.  Serve hot with Peanut Sauce.
