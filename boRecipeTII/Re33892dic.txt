Combine first three ingredients and let stand 5 minutes. Cover tightly and  microwave on medium high power for 10 minutes or add 1/2 c liquid and  simmer in a covered pan until tender but not mushy (20-30 minutes). Bring 1  cup water to a boil and add carrot and pepper. Cover, return to a boil and  cook for 2 minutes to crisp-tender. Remove from heat, drain, reserving  liquid. Return liquid to pan and add juice from the pineapples. Bring the  liquid to a boil and add sugar and cider-vinegar. In a small bowl, combine  the cornstarch and tamari. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the hot liquid;  the sauce will thicken and come to a boil almost at once. Add the cooked  TVP, the carrots & pepper, and pineapple to the sauce. Serve over rice or  crisp chow mein noodles. This can be made ahead of time and reheated later.
