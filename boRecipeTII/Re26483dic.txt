Got this recipe out of my In The Kitchen With Bob cookbook. Pam Cobb    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line the pie shell with half the tomato  slices. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, and basil. Layer half the Swiss  cheese on top of the tomatoes, then cover with a layer of the onions.  Repeat layers, starting with the tomatoes.    Sprinkle the top of the pie with Parmesan cheese, and bake until bubbly.  Serve hot. If serving as a one-dish meal, serve with a green salad on the  side. Makes 4 servings.
