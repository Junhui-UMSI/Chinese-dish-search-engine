When you are  ready to broil it, place a mushroom cap on the end of each skewer, then 2  salmon cubes, another mushroom, more salmon, and end with a mushroom cap.  Brush well with oil.    Place skewers on a rack over the grill, turning several times during the  process, basting with the marinade.  Serve with plain boiled potatoes and  fresh dill.  (If you cant get fresh dill, serve dill pickles.) Serves 4.    (Adapted from a recipe in "James Beards Fish Cookery", Beard)    Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #95
