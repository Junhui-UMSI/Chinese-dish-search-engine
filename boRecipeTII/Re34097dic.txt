Basting/injecting Sauce Recipe
Meat tenderizer, Worcestershire Sauce, Pepper sauce, Garlic powder, Salt, Garlic juice, Water, Onion juice, 
Mix all ingredients in sauce pan and bring to a boil, let simmer for at  least 15 minutes, remove from heat and let cool. This sauce may be used on  meat, poultry, or wild game. You may adjust above seasoning to taste by  adding different spices or varying amounts. Any left over sauce may be  stored for several weeks in the refrigerator. Some cooks substitute other  liquids instead of water. Some of the liquids substituted for water are  beer, Coke, Dr Pepper, and fruit juice(apple, pineapple, cranberry, etc.) .  * Some people find the 1/2 cup of salt in the above recipe is too much for  their taste.    * When seasoning fowl, puncture skin as few times as possible.    * When seasoning large cuts of meat always inject from the top so the sauce  wont leak out. If you feel it necessary to inject from the side, always  angle needle downward.  Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 18, 1998
