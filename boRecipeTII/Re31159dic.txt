Banana Sunflower Seed Cookies
Sunflower seeds, Sugar, Baking soda, Bananas, Vegetable oil, Flour, 
Bananas should be really ripe.    Preheat oven to 350.    Peel and mash bananas.  In large bowl, beat oil, bananas, and sugar. Mix  flour with sunflower seeds and soda. Add dry ingredients to banana mixture  and stir until thoroughly mixed.   Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2" apart onto ungreased cookie  sheet.    Bake about 15 minutes, until edges are golden brown.    I got this recipe from my Grandmother. They are really wonderful cookies,  moist, chewy, and nutty. She makes them with only 1/2 cup sugar and they  taste great!    Shared by Pattye Zensen
