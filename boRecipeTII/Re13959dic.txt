Preheat the oven to 350F.  Generously butter and flour the springform pan,  tapping out any excess flour.  Set aside.    In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk, beat the eggs and  sugar until thick and lemon-colored, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, oil,  milk, and vanilla extract, and mix until blended.    Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Add the lemon  zest and orange zest, and toss to coat the zest with flour. Spoon the  mixture into the bowl of batter and stir with a wooden spoon until  thoroughly blended.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix once more.  Set aside for 10 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the liquids.    Stir about 3/4 of the grapes into the batter.  Spoon the batter into the  prepared cake pan and smooth out the top with a spatula.    Place the pan in the center of the oven.  Bake for 15 minutes, then  sprinkle the top of the cake with the remaining grapes. Bake until the top  is a deep golden brown and the cake feels quite firm when pressed with a  fingertip, about 40 minutes more, for a total baking time of 55 minutes.  Remove to a rack and cool.  After 10 minutes, run a knife along the sides  of the pan. Release and remove the side of the springform pan, leaving the  cake on the pan base.  Sprinkle with confectioners sugar just before  serving.  Serve at room temperature, cut into thin wedges. Serves 8-12  Typed in MMformat by Cindy Hartlin  Source: Cookbook Digest Sept/Oct 97.
