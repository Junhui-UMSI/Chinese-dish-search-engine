April Osheas Authentic Italian Meatballs (X
Egg, Onion, Salt, Garlic, Parsley, Breadcrumbs, Parmesian Cheese, Progesso Italian Flavored, Ground beef *, Pepper, 
* The old country way is a mixture of 1/3 beef, 1/3 pork and 1/3-veal  ground together. But I think beef is much better. ** Heaping Tsp., save  time by using the jar of pre-chopped garlic. Mix all ingredients together  in a large bowl with your hands making sure everything is well mixed. Form  into meatballs and fry *** in a large skillet with about 1/2 cup olive oil  over medium high heat. Turn on all sides to brown and cook through. When  all the way cooked, add them to your sauce and let them cook slowly for  about 1 hour. *** Can also be browned in the oven on a baking or broiler  rack. This will produce less greasy but also drier meatballs. Note: Aprils  ancestors (on both sides) go back to Italy. I dont think the same is true  for her husband!
