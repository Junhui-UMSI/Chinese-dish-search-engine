Berts Best Breakfast - Oatmeal Burgers
Leftover cooked oatmeal, Butter or margarine, Bread crumbs, 
With a large rounded spoon, spoon out patties of leftover oatmeal about 2  inches wide and 1/2 inch thick. Then with clean hands, place them on a  plate covered with bread crumbs. Turn them over once so the sides are  covered with crumbs.    Next, for each oatmeal burger place 1/2 tablespoon butter in a frying pan.  Fry the burgers until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides. Enjoy  with milk, syrup, or apple butter if desired.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Oct 26, 98
