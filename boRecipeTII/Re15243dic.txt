December 18, 1996    >From Jo Heringslack, Wauconda    1. To prepare cake: In a large mixing bowl, stir together cake mix and  pudding. Add eggs, oil, milk, 3 tablespoons whiskey and the walnuts and  raisins. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed for 3 minutes.    2. Pour batter into a well-greased, 10-inch tube pan. Bake in a preheated  350-degree oven until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the cake  comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes.    3. Meanwhile, make the topping: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium  heat. Stir in sugar and whiskey. Bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer,  stirring, until sugar dissolves and mixture thickens slightly, about 7  minutes.    4. Remove cake pan from oven and set it on a wire rack. With a fork, poke  several holes in the top of the cake. Spoon half of the topping over the  cake, letting it soak in. Let cake cool completely in pan, about 1 hour.    5. Run a knife around the edges of the cake and turn it out onto a serving  plate. Brush top and sides of cake with remaining syrup and serve.
