Recipe and Instructions for Flesh-Toned Brain (Halloween)
Flesh-Toned Brain, 
Ingredients: * 3 large boxes (net weight 6 ozs. each box) peach or  watermelon flavored gelatin (use any flavored gelatin of your choice if  flesh tone is not desired) * 1 can (net weight 12 ozs.) lite evaporated  skimmed milk (99.5% fat free). No other milk will work! * 2 tsps. of  vegetable oil (for lubricating plastic mold) * Green food coloring (I  recommend 3 drops) * 3 1/2 cups water total (2 1/2 cups boiled, 1 c. cold)  1.  Spray or smear small amount of vegetable oil (2 tsps.) inside entire  cavity of the plastic mold, wipe out excess oil from cavity and set mold  aside.  Make sure cavity of mold is completely dry before applying the oil.  2.  Put flavored gelatin in a large bowl.  Add 2 1/2 c. of boiling water.  Stir until completely dissolved, about 3 minutes.  Use whisk or large fork  for stirring. 3. Stir in 1 c. cold water 4. Stir in skimmed milk for 2  minutes 5. Add a few drops of green food coloring to darken (for flesh  tone). 6. Pour gelatin mixture into the plastic mold, but do not fill to  the top.  Leave approximately one inch of space from the top. Set the mold  on the stand and refrigerate overnight.    If clear brain is desired, leave out skimmed milk and add an additional 1  1/2 c. of cold water.    Dont tell my doc, but Im planning on making him a red and green brain for  Christmas.  This is a festively gruesome addition to any party! The  catalogs also feature eerily lifelike molds of hands, too...imagine, a  brain and a hand at your next Halloween soiree! Like "The Monster Mash",  this has "graveyard smash" potential!
