I checked this great little book out of the library a couple days ago. Its  called Simple Soups by Teresa Kennedy. Here are a few examples of her great  sounding recipes!    Place all the ingredients in a large saucepan or stockpot and bring to a  boil over high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour.  Strain the stock through a sieve or colander into another kettle. Return to  the burner, turn heat to medium, and boil until the broth is reduced by one  third. Use as desired, or divide into 2-cup portions and freeze for up to  six months. Makes 10 cups, or enough for 3 to 4 batches of soup    Posted to EAT-L Digest 20 Sep 96    From:    Patricia Moore <PCPJMOOR@IHC.COM>    Date:    Sat, 21 Sep 1996 15:40:45 -0700
