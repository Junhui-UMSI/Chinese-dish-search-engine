Lebkuchen
Candied citron, Baking soda, Ground cinnamon, Ground cardamom, Ground allspice, Ground cloves, Vegetable cooking spray, Sugar, Eggs, Honey, All-purpose flour, divided, 
Beat sugar and eggs at medium speed of a mixer until thick and pale (about  5 minutes). Add the honey; beat at medium speed 2 minutes or until  well-blended.    Place 1 cup flour and citron in food processor, and process until the  citron is finely chopped. Spoon citron mixture into a large bowl; add  remaining 4 cups flour, baking soda, and next 4 ingredients, stirring well.  Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, stirring until well-blended  (the dough will be stiff). Cover and chill 8 hours.    Divide the dough in half; wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap, and  chill. Roll remaining half to 1/4-inch thickness on a well-floured surface.  Using a floured mold with 2-inch square imprints, press mold firmly into  dough. Remove mold; cut cookie squares apart, and place on baking sheets  coated with cooking spray.    Cover with a towel, and let stand in a cool, dry place 12 hours or  overnight to dry.    Bake cookies at 300 degrees for 13 minutes; let cool on wire racks. Repeat  procedure with the remaining dough. Yield: about 90 cookies (serving size:        1    cookie).
