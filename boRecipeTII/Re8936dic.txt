President Clintons Chicken-Broccoli Enchiladas
Jalapeno pepper; minced, Ground cinnamon, Shredded; reduced-fat, Salt; (optional), Chili powder, Red onion; chopped fine, Broccoli, Cooked; skinless, boneless, Nonfat yogurt, Garlic, Ground cumin, Cooked brown rice, Corn tortillas, (15-ounce) no-salt-added, Minced fresh cilantro, Evaporated skim milk, olive oil, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove tough stems from broccoli and break  into florets. Steam broccoli until crisp but tender, and set aside. In a  large nonstick pan, heat the oil; saute the onion for 3 or 4 minutes to  soften. Add the garlic, jalapeno, cumin, chili powder, cinnamon and  chicken. Stir and cook to mix well and heat through. Season with salt, if  desired. Remove from heat and stir in broccoli; divide into 6 equal  portions, and set aside.    In blender or food processor combine tomatoes, cilantro and evaporated  milk; blend well. Pour into pot and heat just to boiling. Remove from heat  and dip each tortilla into the hot mixture to soften slightly. Fill each  tortilla with 1/6 of the chicken mixture; roll up, and place seam side down  in a baking dish large enough to hold all the enchiladas in a single layer.  Repeat the process and pour the remaining tomato-milk mixture over  enchiladas; sprinkle cheese over the top. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until  sauce is bubbly, and serve with brown rice and a dollop of yogurt.
