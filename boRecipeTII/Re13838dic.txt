Willie Nelsons "Outlaw" Breakfast Eggs
Lean bacon, Butter, salt and pepper, Eggs, Water, 
Use just enough butter to grease small skillet. Heat skillet until hot  enough to sizzle a drop of water. Break and slip eggs into skillet without  breaking yolk. Sprinkle bacon on top. Season with salt and pepper. Cook  over low heat about 1 minute, or until eggs turn white. Add water; cover  skillet tightly to hold to steam which bastes the eggs. While eggs are  cooking, toast bread or english muffins and top with fried eggs. If  desired, add salsa, chili sauce, chili, or catsup. Serves 1.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Crane C.
