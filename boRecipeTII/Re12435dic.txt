In a 1955 cook book (The Complete Book of Outdoor Cookery by Brown and  Beard) I found this:    Put beef and fowl into water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added  for each quart. (there should be a little more water than enough to cover  the meat. Needless to say, youll need a mammoth kettle; we use our two  largest ones.) Bring to a boil, then cook very slowly, covered, until beef  and fowl are tender. Remove meat from cooking broth, cool, then cut both  beef and fowl into bit-size pieces. Return meat (without bones) to broth,  bring to a boil, and add vegetables in order given. When liquid comes to a  full rolling boil again, add rosemary and pepper; lower heat; cook slowly  ubtil all vegetables are done (about 45 minutes). Add salt to taste.    The burgoo was ladled into tin cups as the famishing hordr circled the  steaming caldron. Corn bread squares, hush puppies or corn dodgers were  served with this one-dish meal which was eaten with a spoon.
