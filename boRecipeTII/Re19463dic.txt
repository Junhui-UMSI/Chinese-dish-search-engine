The Lemon Poppyseed Cake at The Vegetarian Restaurant ( 4 Dundonald St.,  Toronto, (416) 961-9522 is "absolutely enjoyable and I am hoping you can  publish their version of this classic cake for me".     "We are pleased to share this recipe and suspect the request came because  the cake is unusually moist and has a wonderful strong lemon flavour", says  Susan Stachyra, who manages the bakeshop where desserts for the downtown  restaurant and The West End Vegetarian Restaurant are turned out. Before  getting into the baking business 1 1/2 years ago, the former school teacher  from North Bay, Ontario says that baking was a hobby.

Take my word for it, it is near impossible to duplicate it by adding  molasses to granulated sugar. It looks okay but the flavour just is NOT  right for the purist.
