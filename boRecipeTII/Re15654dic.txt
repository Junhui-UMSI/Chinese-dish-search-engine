A Great Zucchini Quiche
Onion, Pepper, Eggs, zucchini, Grated Parmesan cheese, Fresh parsley, Oregano, Salt, Vegetable oil, Garlic powder, Bisquick, 
Mix and beat all ingredients, except zucchini. Fold in zucchini. Pour into  a greased 10-inch pie plate or quiche pan.    Bake in 350 degree oven until filling is browned and knife inserted comes  out clean. (35 to 40 minutes)    You may add grated Cheddar cheese and top with Ratatouille (diced eggplant,  sliced onions, garlic, green peppers, tomatoes, all sauteed in a little  olive oil. Season with a little oregano or fresh basil and salt and  pepper).    Substitute yellow squash for zucchini. This freezes well and may be warmed  in the microwave oven after thawing.
