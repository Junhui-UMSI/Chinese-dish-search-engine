Pound the  chicken slices lightly with the flat side of a cleaver or the bottom of a  heavy bottle. Strip off paper.    3. Season slices with salt & a few grindings of pepper, then dip in flour &  shake off excess.    4. in heavy pan, melt butter with oil over moderate heat. Brown the chicken  to a light golden brown. Do not overcook. Transfer chicken breasts to a  buttered shallow baking dish large enough to hold them comfortable.    5. Place slice of prociutto then a slice of cheese on each. Sprinkle the  Parmesan cheese & dribble chicken stock over tops. Bake uncovered in middle  of oven for 10 minutes, or until cheese melts. Serve immediately.
