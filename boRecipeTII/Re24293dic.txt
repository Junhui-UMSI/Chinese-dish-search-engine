Tripe
Onion, Butter, Water, Honeycomb tripe, parsley, tomato sauce, canned, olive oil, salt and pepper, 
Parboil the tripe for about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, cut into  strips about 1"by 3". Saute onion in butter and olive oil. When they are  golden add the rest of the ingredients andmix well. Simmer for 1 1/2 to 2  hours or until tender. If needed, add a bit more water at the end to make  just a bit of sauce to soak up with some good crusty bread. Serve hot with  grated cheese on the side. Don`t forget the bread.   Variation: with a few minor adjustments, you can use this as a pasta  sauce. Cut the tripe a bit smaller and add about 4 more oz of tomato sauce  and 1/2 cup of dry wine, white or red. This will give you more sauce for  the spaghetti. Don`t forget to adjust the salt and pepper.
