White Almond Fudge
Almond extract, Pkg. cream cheese, Sifted confectioners sugar, Chopped almonds, Salt, 
Beat cream cheese until smooth & soft with electric mixer set at cream (or  beat with a spoon).  Then slowly blend in remaining ingredients. Press into  a buttered 9x5x3" loaf pan.  Chill until firm, then cut in 21 pieces. Makes  about 1 pound.    Variation:  Coconut White Fudge - Substitute 1/2 c. flaked or cookie  coconut for almonds.  Makes 21 pieces.    Im sure you could leave out the almonds and use vanilla instead of almond  extract to make Vanilla Fudge, but I doubt it would turn out white.
