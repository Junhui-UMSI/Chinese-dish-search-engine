Potatoes; cooked & mashed, Salt pork, fatty, Potatoes; finely grated, 
Soak the pork overnight in cold water to remove the salt, and cut into  cubes. Extract the water from the grated potatoes by putting them in a  cotton bag and squeezing vigorously. Mix the mashed potatoes with grated  potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the potato mixture into balls  resembling small snowballs. Make a hole in the centre of the potato ball  and add 1 Tbsp of the salt pork. Close the hole and roll the poultines in  flour. Gently drop the poultines 2 or 3 at a time, into a large pot of  boiling salted water, ensuring that the water is kept at a rolling boil.  Simmer the poultines for 2-3 hours. Eat the poultines hot with butter, salt  and pepper, or as a dessert with sugar and molasses. MAKES: 6 POULTINES
