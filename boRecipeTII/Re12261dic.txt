Zucchini in a Yogurt Dressing
Ground roasted cumin seeds, Brown or granulated sugar, Vegetable oil, Salt, plus 1/4 teaspoon, Brown mustard seeds, Plain yogurt, Zucchini (2 medium), cut, Cayenne pepper, or to taste, 
Bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt, stir  and put in the zucchini. Boil rapidly for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the  zucchini are just done. Drain and leave to cool.    Put the yogurt in a bowl and beat lightly with a fork until smooth. Add  remaining salt, cayenne, roasted cumin, and sugar. Stir to mix.    Heat the oil in a very small pan or skillet over fairly high heat. When  very hot, add the mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop,  this takes just a few seconds, pour the seeds and oil over the yogurt. Stir  to mix. Gently fold the zucchini into the yogurt. Serve warm or cold.    Yield: 4 servings    Note 1: Ground roasted cumin seeds, place 3 to 4 tablespoons of whole cumin  seeds into a heated, small cast iron skillet. Keep over medium heat. Stir  the cumin until it is a few shades darker and emits a distinct roasted  aroma. Grind in a clean and dry coffee grinder and store in a tightly  lidded jar.
