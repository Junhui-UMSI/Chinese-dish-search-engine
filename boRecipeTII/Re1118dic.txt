The Cook & Kitchen Staff are offering you four different Thanksgiving Day  Dinner menus during November, and weve nearly finished serving-up our  final recipe collection, featuring a "Thanksgiving Day Dinner on the Farm"  theme.    Todays recipe can be prepared in well under an hour, and will be a  well-received side service for your Thanksgiving Day Dinner guests. The  recipe may also be prepared up to one week prior to your feast, so its an  easy addition to your dinner table.    If you elect to prepare todays recipe with your holiday meal, The Kitchen  Staff strongly recommends you double it, because its impossible to keep  everyone out of this tangy applesauce until your big occasion at the dinner  table.    In a heavy saucepan over a moderate heat, cook the apples, cranberries,  sugar, apple juice, cinnamon sticks, and the lemon peel, stirring  frequently for about 20 minutes, or until the apples are very soft. Discard  the cinnamon sticks and the lemon peel.    Force the apple mixture through the medium disk of a food mill into a bowl,  or process in a food processor or blender in small batches to your desired  consistency, making sure to stir in a bit of the butter with each batch.    Serve the applesauce warm or chilled. The applesauce keeps, covered and  chilled, for a week, so feel free to prepare the cranberry applesauce in  advance of your holiday meal.
