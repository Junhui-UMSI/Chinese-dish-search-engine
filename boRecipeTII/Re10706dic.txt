This is a quick recipe that produces a slightly  hot, very aromatic chili.  I liked it very much. Brown the turkey in a skillet. Transfer to a 3 quart  pot. Brown the onion in the oil (yes, in the skillet). Transfer to the pot.  Add all other ingredients except the beans to the pot and simmer, covered,  for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, adding a little more water if things  dry out too much. Drain the beans (or not, as you choose) and add them to  the pot. Simmer another 10 minutes.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #122 by novmom@juno.com (Angela [lynn]  Gilliland) on May 01, 1997
