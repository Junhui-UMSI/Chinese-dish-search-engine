Scrub and dry the potatoes. Cut a small deep slit in the top of each.  Set the potatoes on the middle rack of a preheated 375F. oven and bake  about 1 hour, or until potatoes are tender when pricked with a fork.     Let potatoes cool slightly, cut off and discard the tops, and scrape the  potato pulp into a bowl. Do not scrape so deeply that you tear the potato  skin. Salt and pepper the potato shells; reserve. Mash the potato pulp;  reserve.     Melt the butter in a small skillet and saute the chopped onion, covered,  until tender and lightly colored, about 25 minutes. Add the mushrooms and  saute for another 5 minutes. Stir in the lobster or crab. Season with salt  and pepper, add the vermouth, then raise heat to a boil. Stir frequently  over high heat until all liquid has boiled away. Stir in cr?me fra?che and  remove from heat.     Combine lobster mixture with the reserved mashed potato pulp and 1/2 cup  Jarlsberg. Taste, correct seasoning; add heavy cream if the mixture seems  too dry.     Stuff the mixture into the reserved potato skins; mound the filling  slightly. Sprinkle additional grated cheese on top and place on baking  sheet.     Bake again at 400F., until potatoes are hot and cheese is bubbling.  Serve immediately
