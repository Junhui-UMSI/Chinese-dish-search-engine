I have adapeted this recipe from 1,000 Low-Fat Vegetarian Recipes by Sue  Spliter. The recipes in this book are not very low fat by my standards but  there are some ideas.    Note this recipe is huge. I use a very large pan. Suggest you cut it in  half for a 9inch x 13 inch pan.    Put potatoes, onions and mushrooms in a non-stick wok with a little water  (about 1/4 cup) simmer until potatoes almost done. Add tomato, salt,  zuccini, pepper, barley, cinnamon, oregano, thyme and garlic. Cook an  additional 5 mintues.    Put eggplant in bottom of dish. spoon over the potato-mushroom mixture. Top  with white sauce topping and sprinkle with nutmeg. Bake at 350 degrees  until lightly brown on top (about 45 min) Cool 5 to 10 minutes before  cutting.    White Sauce Topping: Heat 2 cups of the milk to almost bolilig. Stir the  flour into the remaining cup of milk. Pour into the hot milk stirring  constantly and cook until a thick sauce forms. Stir part of the hot sauce  into the egg substitute mixture then stir that mixture into the rest of the  hot sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste.
