This is an adaptation of a recipe in the Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook  by Julee Rosso & Sheila Lukins (Recipe called for chocolate chips and  walnuts rather than the white chocolate and macademia nuts.)    Cream butter, shorten, and both sugars until light and fluffy. Add the  eggs, milk, and vanilla and beat until blended. Sift the flour, baking  powder, baking soda, and salt together and add to the butter mixture. (I  use my big Kitchen Aid mixer, and just sprinkle everything in slowly.) Stir  just until blended. Stir in the oats, chocolate and nuts.    Refrigerate for 1 hour. (I usually skip this step, and the cookies turn out  fine.)    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place teaspoons of dough 2 inches apart on  greased cookie sheets. Bake until the edges are slightly browned, but the  cookies are still very light colored, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven  and let cool on the sheets for 5 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool  completely.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 02 Feb 97 by Bodle <bodle@POLARNET.COM> on Feb 3,  1997.
