In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in water. Let it proof for       10    minutes.    Add olive oil, flour, herbs, salt, and remaining water to make a soft  dough.  Knead with an electric mixer and dough hook or by hand for 5  minutes, or until smooth and elastic, adding a little more flour to prevent  sticking.    Oil the large mixing bowl without washing it, and turn the dough several  times to coat it.  Cover with a damp clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap  and put in a warm place away from drafts for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until  doubled in bulk.    Punch the dough down and return it to the bowl.  Coat it with olive oil and  let it rise 20-30 minutes or until light.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Flatten the dough by hand onto a 13 X  18" oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake for 20 minutes  or until golden brown.  Brush the focaccia with oil after baking. When the  bread has cooled, cut into 4-inch squares for sandwiches.    Sylvias comments: I mixed up everything except the "brush with" oil in the  breadmachine.  That 5-1/4 c flour is fiction, it barely took 3-1/2 cups. I  wasnt sure about the 1 oz yeast but figured it might be a tablespoon,  which I used.  Then I split the one big loaf into two pie-pan loaves. Maybe  this was designed as a sandwich bread, it sure didnt impress me as a true  flavorful focaccia.  Even the salt and herbs didnt give it much flavor. I  doubt Ill make it again.
