Brown ox tails well in hot fat. ADD: Simmer at least 3 1/4 hours. When meat  is tender, remove from bone. Return meat to pot. ADD: Cover and simmer 30  minutes. Skim off as much fat as you can. This soup may be made the day  before eating - then the fat is easily removed. Heat through before eating.
