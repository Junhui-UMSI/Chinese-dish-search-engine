Dried Pasilla, Distilled white vingegar, Veggie oil, Garlic, Dried Oregano, Dried Ancho chiles;, Onion, Sugar, Ground cumin, 
Cover chiles with hot water, let sit for 15 min. Combine chiles, and 1/4 to  1/2 cup of the water they were soaking in, onion, garlic, oregano and cumin  in a blender and puree. Saute the mixture in oil for 5 min add vinegar and  sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer until thick about 5-8 min.    I checked my my "whole Chile Pepper Book" and theres a recipe on p. 129  for shrimp in adobo sauce. The cookbook says that its "a sauce made with  chiles, vinegar, herbs and garlic that is popular in the Philippines as  well as in Mexico" -- Erica Wissolik <EWISSOLIK@crs.loc.gov>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
