1. Puree first 10 ingredients in blender until almost smooth.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and refrigerate.)   2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly oil 2 medium baking dishes.  3. Divide fish between prepared dishes.  Add 1 bunch whole green onions to each dish.  (I have never used the onions.)      4. Pour half of sauce over fish, dividing between dishes.      5. Bake until fish is just cooked through, basting frequently with remaining sauce and adding 1/3 c. water to each dish if sauce begins to  burn, about 20 minutes.  Arrange fish and baked green onions on plates;  garnish with chopped green onions.
