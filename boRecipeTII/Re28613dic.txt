Toss meat with 3 T. olive oil and 2 T. chili powder in non-aluminum  bowl.  Let stand in refrigerator overnight.     Heat 3 T. oil in large, heavy skillet over med-hi heat.  Brown the  meat in batches (do not crowd) on all sides, about 5 minutes.   Transfer to a large pot, using slotted spoon.  Add chorizo to skillet  and brown well.  Transfer to pot using slotted spoon.  Reduce heat to  med-lo.  Add more oil to skillet, if necessary.  Add onions and cook  until translucent, about 10 minutes.  Add garlic, chili powder,  oregano, cumin, salt and pepper.  Stir 3 minutes then transfer to  pot.  Stir in tomatoes, beer and tomato paste.  Bring to a boil then  reduce heat.  Cover and simmer until meat is very tender, stirring  occasionally, about 3 hours.  Uncover during last hour if necessary  to thicken liquid into sauce.     Some good accompaniments are pinto beans and salsa as side dishes.
