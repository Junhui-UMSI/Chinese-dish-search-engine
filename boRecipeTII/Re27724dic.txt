On the bottom half, lay a  piece of turkey, 2 ounces of cheese and some shredded lettuce. Fold one end  of the tortilla in toward the center and then, from the bottom half, roll  it closed. Wrap in foil or waxed paper.    Yield: 4 wraps    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8959    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #790 by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Sep 19, 1997
