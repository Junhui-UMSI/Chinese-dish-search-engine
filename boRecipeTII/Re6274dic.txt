Drain and repeat the process until the water is clear.    Transfer the rinsed quinoa to a saucepan and cover with water and some  salt. Bring the liquid to a boil, lower the heat and boil, uncovered, for  10 minutes or until all the grains are translucent. Take care not to  overcook. Drain the quinoa immediately but do not cool under cold water or  the grain will be waterlogged. If not eating right away, transfer the  quinoa to a cloth lined baking pan and fluff up with two forks to help cool  the grain a little faster. Yield: 7 cups.
