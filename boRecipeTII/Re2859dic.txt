Peanut Butter French Toast with Hot Grape Jelly
cinnamon, Eggs, Bread, Peanut butter, Butter, Grape Jelly, 
Proportions are not important to this recipe. Make peanut butter sandwiches  and dip in egg and milk mixture which has been seasoned with one or more of  the optional ingredients. Fry in a little butter or oil over medium heat  until golden brown on both sides. Heat grape jelly in a small sauce pan  until liquefied and syrup-like. Serve over fried sandwiches.    NOTES : This one is a particular favorite of the younger generation in our  family. Not only does it help get teenagers out of bed on a Saturday morni=  ng, but its also good enough to elicit some "volunteer" help in cleaning  up afterwards.
