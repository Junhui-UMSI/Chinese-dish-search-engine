TO SEPARATE THE CABBAGE leaves, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and  plunge in a whole head of cabbage. As soon as the water returns to the  boil, drain the cabbage. Carefully remove the outer leaves. Combine the  bread crumbs and milk in a large work bowl and set aside. Cook the onion in  the butter until soft and add it to the bread crumbs. Add the thyme, egg,  ground meat, salt and pepper and mix well. Place a cabbage leaf on a work  surface and place a heaping tablespoon or 2 of stuffing in the center. Roll  up the cabbage to enclose the stuffing. Pack the stuffed leaves into a  lidded casserole. Place in preheated 350F oven and bake for 1 hour.    Meanwhile, mix the tomatoes, flour and sour cream together. Pour this over  the cabbage, replace the cover and cook another 15 minutes.    MICHAEL ROBERTS - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
