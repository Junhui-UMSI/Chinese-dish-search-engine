Pumpkin Waffles #1
Canned pumpkin, Cinnamon, nutmeg, 
Add a bit of canned pumpkin to your waffle batter along with some  cinnamon and nutmeg--just a touch of each. Prepare your waffles in the  usual way and serve with maple syrup. This great breakfast treat may stick  to your waffle iron unless you use a bit of Pam spray first.      Stir the pumpkin into the batter, along with the spices, just prior to  folding in the egg whites. Proceed as usual with the cooking. Remember that  the pumpkin is going to make these waffles a bit more dense than a plain  waffle. Great for dinner!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
