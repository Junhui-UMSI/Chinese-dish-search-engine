Pot of Beans Sidedish
Any other beans you want, Chopped Tomatoes, Serrano chiles, sliced into, Cumin, toasted and ground, White beans, Black beans, Garlic, Dried epazote, Pintos, Kidney beans, Few dashes of your favorite, salt and pepper, Cilantro, chopped, Green onions, cut diagonally, 
Just add the epazote to the beans while they are cooking. Use dry beans and  add the epazote <after finely chopping the tough stems> to the pot. To be  honest, I have never used dried epazote. I grow fresh epazote in the summer  and usually throw 3 or 4 spigs in with the beans. I dont bother to chop  them. I remove the stems <the leafy part disapears somewhere in the pot of  beans> after the beans are done. The flavor is very noticeable, and quite  delicious.    If you just want a pot of beans as a side dish, here is a recipe. Make any  adjustments to suit yourself, as I am making this one up as I type. It  should work though. In fact, lets do this one with canned beans. Here  goes:    Rinse the beans well in cold water. Put into a pot and add the remaining  ingredients. If the juice from the tomatoes doesnt cover the beans <I  doubt if it will>, add some beer <Prefered> or water to cover. Bring to a  boil, reduce to simmer and cook uncovered for half an hour or more to blend  the flavors. Add more liquid as needed. Serve with a slotted spoon.    That sounds like it should work. In fact its making me hungry. Im getting  ready to make some chili for dinner tonight, so Ill have to try this one  another time. In fact I better get it in gear. Looks like dinner wont be  until 7:30 or 8:00 tonight.    Posted to bbq-digest Digest V97 #018 by Kurt Lucas <kurtl@navicom.com> on  Mar 2, 1997.
