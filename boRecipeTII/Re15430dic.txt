White Chip Chocolate Cookies
Flour, Sugar, Margerine, Powdered cocoa, Vanilla extract, Eggs, Baking soda, Salt, white chocolate, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In large mixer bowl, cream butter and sugar  until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until light and fluffy.    Stir together flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Beat into sugar mixture,  mixing until well blended. Stir in white chips.    Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 8-9 minutes.  Cool slightly on pan before removing to a wire rack. Cool completely. Makes  about 5 dozen cookies.    Personal Note:  Do NOT overbake. Nine minutes is the tops. The cookies will  be soft. They puff up while baking, but will flatten upon cooling. Do not  be tempted to bake them "just a minute" longer. If you do, the bottoms will  burn. (I found out the hard way...)    I compared this recipe with the one on the back of the Nestlees White Chip  bag....they were similar, but not identical. For instance, this one doesnt  use brown sugar like the Nestlees one did. I have absolutely no idea where  my mother-in-law clipped this recipe, but it is definitely worth your time  to make it.
