Add 3/4  cup sugar and cook slowly for 10 minutes or until transparent and glazed.  Lift apricots out of the syrup and drain on wire rack. Save the syrup to  glaze cake.    Sift flour with the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt.  In a  bowl, combine all fruits and walnuts.  Add flour mixture and mix gently.    Beat eggs with vanilla until light and fluffy.  Gently mix into fruit and  nut mixture.  Turn into a greased 9 inch springform pan.  Bake at 300 F  about 1 1/2 hours or until cake is set in center. Cool in pan.    When cake is cold, remove from pan and brush with heated reserved apricot  syrup. OPTION:  add rum or brandy after heating syrup and before brushing  on cake.
