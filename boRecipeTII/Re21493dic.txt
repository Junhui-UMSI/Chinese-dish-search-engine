Apple Pie
Pastry for a 9-inch, Ground cinnamon, Brown sugar; firmly packed,, Fresh Lemon Juice, Tart apples; firm, Ground nutmeg, Milk; cream or 1 egg,, Unsalted butter; cut into, 
Preheat the oven to 400F. Roll out half the pastry on a floured board and  fit it into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim the edge and chill well.    Peel, quarter, core, and slice the apples. Toss them in a large bowl with  the lemon juice. Add the sugar and spices and toss again. Pile the apples  into the pie shell, dot the top with butter, and wet the pastry lip. Roll  out the other half of the pastry, carefully fit it over the pie, and trim  the edge, allowing a half-inch overhang. Tuck the extra pastry under the  lower lip and crimp it to seal the crust. Cut vents into the top crust.  Decorate the top of the pie with extra pastry cutouts or whatever design  you may choose, plain or fancy. Brush the surface with a little milk or  cream or with an egg thinned with water.    Bake the pie for 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 35OF and bake until the  crust is golden brown and the apples are tender, 20 to 30 minutes longer.  If the edge of the crust browns too much, cover it with aluminum foil.  Serve the pie warm or at room temperature with a slice of cheddar cheese, a  scoop of vanilla ice cream, or a dollop of whipped cream.    NOTES : This American standard has countless variations.  To name a few,  add chopped nuts or cranberries to the filling; substitute whiskey for the  lemon juice; add more apples and use a top crust only for a deep-dish pie.
