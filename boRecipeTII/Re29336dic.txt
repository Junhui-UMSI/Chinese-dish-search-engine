Baked Tofu Szechuan Style
The Sauce:, Oriental sesame oil, fresh ginger, Tahini, The Marinade:, Chili paste, Dry sherry, Tamari soy sauce, Vegetable oil, Extra-firm tofu, 
In a medium-size bowl, combine the marinade ingredients. Gently stir in the  tofu and coat well. Let marinate for 30 minutes, or up to 8 hours. Cover  and chill if longer than 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Pour the tofu and its marinade into a shallow baking dish in one layer.  Bake for 15 minutes, tossing once with a spatula. Combine the sauce  ingredients and pour over the tofu. Toss to coat evenly. Return to the oven  and bake 10 more minutes, or until golden brown. Let sit 10 minutes before  serving; it should be served warm, not piping hot.
