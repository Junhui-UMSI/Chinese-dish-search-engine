I consulted my two Jewish food experts, my 85 year old father and my  dearest friend who lives in New York. Both of them came up with the same  non-recipe. They say that "Gademke" (that is the way I have always heard it  pronounced and that a is the way they pronounce it) chicken is a chicken  roasted in very little water in the oven with onions. My father, speaking  of his mothers Gademke chicken said that on very special occasions she  would roast it with carrots and potatoes. I looked through a bunch of  Jewish cookbooks and I think that your friend is probably correct, although  it may be in one of Jennie Grossingers cookbooks. Unfortunately I cant  locate mine.  Below is the recipe that I found that comes closest to the  above description.  If you leave out the peas, green beans and mushrooms I  think this may be what you are looking for. My father doesnt remember it  ever being stuffed.    The Complete American Jewish Cookbook, The World Publishing Company  1952    Stuff chicken with bread stuffing, adding the chopped giblets to stuffing.  Tie legs of chicken.  Place in a large casserole or roasting pan.  Bake  uncovered in hot oven (425 degrees F.) for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to slow  (325 degrees F.).  Add onions.  Cover and bake 30 minutes longer.  Add  potatoes, carrots, and 1 cup hot water.  Cover and cook 30 minutes.  Add  peas, beans, and mushrooms. Season with salt. Cover and bake 30 minutes.  Remove chicken and vegetables to hot platter.
