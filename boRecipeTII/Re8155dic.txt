Potato Crepes
Vegetable oil, Salt, All purpose flour, Egg, Russet potato, milk, pepper, 
Heres a recipe that looks elegant enough for "Gourmet".  Im posting  it here in "Cooking" as well. Id call it "California Cuisine" as it  uses non-Oriental ingredients with both Chinese and European cooking  techniques. The potato crepes are fancy potato pancakes while the  seafood is prepared by poaching in low temperature oil, then  stir-frying++a Chinese technique. The author, Jay Harlow, says: "This  cooking method, in which the seafood is cooked first by a kind of low  temperature deep-frying, is a typical Chinese technique.  It may  appear to use a lot of oil, but most of it is drained away and can be  reused for other frying. The over all amount of oil remaining in the  dish is no more than with other stir-fried dishes." Peel the potato  and put it through a food mill or ricer.  Season to taste with salt  and pepper.  Stir in the flour.  Beat the egg and milk together, add  to the potato mixture, and stir until smooth. Heat half the oil in a  10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pout in half the potato  mixture, shaping it into a thick pancake, 8 to 9 inches in diameter.  Cook until well-browned, 2 to 3 minutes, turn and cook on the other  side. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with  remaining oil and batter. Makes 2 crepes. From the San Francisco  Chronicle, 2/13/91. Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; March 7 1991.
