Pistachio Cream Dessert Pizza
Vanilla extract, Dessert Pizza Shells, Sugar, milk, Egg yolks, Ground pistachios, Fresh fruit for garnish, 
Combine the milk and the ground pistachios and heat to boiling. Let stand  for 30 minutes. Strain through a chinoise or cheesecloth.    Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until light and pale yellow.  Add the pistachio milk. Transfer to a saucepan and cook over low heat,  stirring constantly, until the mixture coats the back of a spoon. Cool  slightly and add vanilla. Refrigerate until well chilled.    Spread pistachio cream over a baked pizza shell. Garnish with fresh fruit  such as strawberries, slices of fresh pears or blueberries.    Source: Pat Bruno Jr., Pizza Today, June 1992.
