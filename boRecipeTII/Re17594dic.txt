Almond Ice Cream
Heavy cream, milk, Egg yolks, Blanched almonds, Superfine sugar, Kirsch, 
Pound the almond into paste. Add milk and heavy cream, mix thoroughly  together. In a saucepan, heat the almond mixture to a boil. Remove from  heat. In a bowl, mix egg yolks, sugar and kirsch for 5 minutes. Add almond  milk and mix well with wooden spoon. Heat the mixture over low heat for 5  minutes without letting it boil.  Stir continuously. Then allow it to cool.  Strain through a sieve into ice cream maker and freeze until the ice cream  is thoroughly firm.    I think you can probably use instant almond paste or almond extract instead  of pounding almond.  Be careful that the paste or extract is sweetened or  not. Also, you can add chopped fruits or nuts into the mixture. Just use  your imagination and creativity.
