All-Purpose Punch
clear pop, pineapple juice, frozen orange juice, 
Reconstitute the orange juice in the punch bowl, add the pineapple juice  and soda pop. Add an ice ring. Makes about 5 qts (l) per batch. If you want  a more orangey-red color the new raspberry ginger ale flavor (pink) also  tastes good. Notice this is not too sweet. If you have a good size punch  bowl a bundt cake pan molds an ice ring that will last several hours before  it melts unless it is 100F in the shade. Congratulations!
