Stuffed Pepper Cups
Green peppers, Salt, Ground beef, Onions, Salt, Pepper, tomatoes, Water, long-grain rice, Worcestershire sauce, Processed cheese (American), 
Here's one I use all the time from my Better Homes and Gardens cookbook:    Cut off the tops of 6 medium green peppers; remove seeds and membrane.  Precook green pepper cups in boiling salted water about 5 minutes; drain.  (For crisp peppers, omit precooking). Sprinkle inside of cups generously  with salt.    Cook 1 pound ground beef and 1/3 cup chopped onion til meat is lightly  browned. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and dash pepper. Add one 1-pound can  tomatoes, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup uncooked long-grain rice, and 1 teaspoon  Worcestershire sauce. Cover and simmer til rice is tender, about 15 minutes.  Stir in 4 ounces sharp process American cheese, shredded (1 cup). Stuff  peppers; stand upright in 10x6x1-1/2 inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at  350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. Serves 6.
