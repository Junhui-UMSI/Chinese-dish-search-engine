Polynesian Pineapple Spread
Shredded coconut, Crushed pineapple, Finely chopped dates, Yogurt cream cheese, 
Mix well and chill. Spread on crackers or fill celery. Makes 2 cups.  Orginal recipe calls for 1/2 cup shredded coconut but I didnt want to use  that much. It really tasted good without the coconut but I put in a little  bit for texture.
