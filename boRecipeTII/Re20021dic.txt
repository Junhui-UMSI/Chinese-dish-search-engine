I just  found this one in the January 1996 issue of Organic Gardening.  I havent  gotten to try it yet.    1. Saute onions and garlic over medium heat until they just begin to turn  golden.    2. Add the carrots, chili, ginger, and cumin and continue to cook until the  carrots just begin to soften.    3. Stir in the eggplant, potatoes, zucchini and cilantro and cook for 2 to  3 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat.    4. When cooked ingredients are cool enough to handle, work in the flour,  egg and bread crumbs with your fingers. Season the mixture to taste, then  shape it into six patties.    5. Saute the patties, cooking on both sides until golden brown.  Serves 6.  Serving suggestion: top with fresh salsa and/or ff cheese.
