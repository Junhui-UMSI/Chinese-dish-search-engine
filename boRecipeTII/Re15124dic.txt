Wheat Beer 1
Saaz hops, Granulated sugar, Wyeast London Ale yeast, Beer extract, 
Bring  two gallows of water to a boil, then add extract. Add sugar.  Add  1/2  oz. Saaz hops to the boil for 30 minutes. Remove heat. Add 1/4  oz.  Saaz  hops  for  aroma.  Add cool water to bring  wort  volume  to  four  gallons. Cool to 75 - 80 degrees. Transfer to primary and pitch yeast.  Ridiculously simple, but very nice and light. Most people who dont like  wheat beers like this one, and many people think that this is a  commer-  cial  product, not homebrew! The Telfords extract is probably the  major  factor  in the success of this recipe--done just right. You need to  put in  some sugar to bring up the level of fermentables, but dont  put  in too  much, or youll get a cidery taste. Dont follow Telfords  instruc- tions,  which say that this kit can make five gallons---too watery.
