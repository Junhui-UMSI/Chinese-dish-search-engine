COOKING: Bake single layer at 250 degrees for 45-55  minutes. DO AHEAD NOTES: Make ahead and serve later. COMMENTS: Chinese Beef  Jerky is a favorite snack in        China. The flavor is a bit on the sweet  side compared      to its western counterpart and definitely not spicy. You  can purchase ready made jerkies in Chinatown. However, in case there is not  one near you, heres a       home made recipe Ms. Yee enjoys sharing.  Source: "Dim      Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for MM by Karen Adler  FNGP13B.
