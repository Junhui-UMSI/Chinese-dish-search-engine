Poulet a la Diable
Mustard; coarse grain, Vermouth, Chicken breast halves, Dijon mustard, Vegetable oil, Water, Heavy cream, Butter or margarine, 
Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed casserole.  Add the oil. Brown the  chicken on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes each side. Carefully pour off  any excess fat. Add the mustards, vermouth and water. Bring the liquid to a  simmer, scraping up the brown bits in the bottom of the pan. Cover and  simmer for 10 minutes. Test the chicken to make sure it is done. (Stick the  point of a knife into the meat near the bone. If the juices run clear, the  chicken is cooked.) Remove the meat to individual dishes and cover to keep  warm.  Add the cream and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well.
