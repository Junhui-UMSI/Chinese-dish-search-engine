Add chili beans and heat through. Cool  slightly. Tear up lettuce in a very large bowl and add rest of veggies. I  usually assemble the rest right before serving. Add meat/beans and cheese.  Toss.  Pour on poppy seed dressing (using this makes a big difference in  taste).  Add crushed tortilla chips last. Serve.    EAT-L Digest  2 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
