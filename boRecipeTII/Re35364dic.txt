Fold one end of the tortilla up about 1 inch over filling; fold  right and left sides over folded end, overlapping.  Fold down remaining  end, and serve.  REFRIED BEANS:  Heat lard in 10-inch skillet over medium heat until hot.  Add pinto beans;  cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Mash beans; stir in remaining  ingredients.  Add oil to skillet if necessary; cook and stir until smooth  paste forms, about 5 minutes.  Garnish with shredded cheese, if desired.
