Gulasz 1 pound stewing beef, in one piece 2 tbl vegetable oil 2 large  onions, chopped 2 cups vegetable broth(above) 3 whole allspice berries 2 to  3 tsp imported paprika Maggi seasoning, to taste 1 tbl flour mixed with 3  tbl water    1. Clean and chop the vegetables for the broth. Cover with the water, add  salt, and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. 2. Soak the beef in water for 15  minutes, pat it dry, and cut it into cubes. 3. Heat the oil in a large  skillet and brown the meat cubes along with the onions for about 15  minutes. Transfer the meat and onions to a heavy pot with a lid. 4. Add the  vegetable broth, allspice, paprika, and a few dashes of Maggi. Simmer until  the meat is tender., about 1 hour. When the meat is almost tender, stir in  the flour-water mixture, and cook for 10 minutes more. Adjust the seasoning  with more Maggi, if desired.    Notes: Soaking the meat is a Polish custom that you might not wish to  follow. Mrs. Ziemianowicz(owner of the restaurant) suggests you serve the  gulasz with kasha, noodles, potato pancakes, or potatoes.
