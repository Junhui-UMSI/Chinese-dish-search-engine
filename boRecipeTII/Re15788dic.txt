About Braising Vegetables
Vegetables, Water, 
*Braising is similar to stewing but uses less liquid compared to  water-steaming, it develops greater nuances of flavor and preserves more  color in vegetables.    *Some recipes for braised vegetables call for a combination of cooking  methods: Certain ingredients -- usually carrots or other dense-textured  vegetables?may be first sauteed in oil or butter to develop color and  flavor, then cooked slowly in a small amount of liquid: wine, sherry,  vegetable stock, defatted beef or chicken stock, or a combination of these.    *The steam-filled atmosphere inside a tightly covered pan or casserole  releases the foods essential oils and juices, enhancing the taste and  aroma of the vegetables and creating an appetizing glaze.    *Any root vegetable -- carrots, onions, leeks, celeriac -- is a candidate  for braising; so are celery, cabbage, Belgian endive, fennel and broccoli,  or a medley of these vegetables. Swiss chard, kale and mustard braise well  if cooked in a very small amount of liquid until barely wilted.    TIPS **Start the braising process with about 1/4 cup liquid per 2 cups of  vegetables, adding more only if the food cooks dry before it is tender.    **Any heatproof casserole with a tight-fighting lid can be used for  braising as long as the dish conducts heat well.    **Braising can be done on top of the stove or in an oven.    **Braising times depend on the variety of vegetables used, their size and  shape, their maturity and freshness.
