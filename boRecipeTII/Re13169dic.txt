Blend well and leave to stand for 25-30  minutes.    Place about 1t of the filling at the center of each wonton skin.  Wet and  join the edges of each wonton, pressing down with your fingers to seal,  then fold each wonton over.    To cook, bring the stock to a rolling boil ine wrapper. Moisten all 4 edges  with water & pull the top corner down to the bottom, folding the wrapper  over the filling to make a triangle. Press edges firmly to make a seal.  Bring left & right corners together above the filling. Overlap the tips of  these corners, moisten with water & press together. Place completed wrapper  on the corn-starch platter & continue till all wrappers are used.    FOR SOUP: Drop wontons into boiling water & cook for 5 minutes. Drain.    TO FRY: Heat 2 to 3 cups of oil in a wok till hot. Deep fry wontons in  batches till golden, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Drain. Serve with dipping  sauce or duck sauce.    Uncooked wontons will keep in the freezer for a good 2 months if well  wrapped. Thaw before frying, but they can be boiled straight from frozen &  cooked 2 minutes longer.
