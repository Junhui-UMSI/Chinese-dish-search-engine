Make chicken salad: In a large bowl whisk together the lime juice, the  salt, the chili powder, the coriander, the mint, and the sugar, stir in the  chicken, the shallot, and the scallion, and stir in the mayonnaise. (The  chicken salad may be made 1 day in advance and kept overed and chilled.)    Cut the bread into 1/3-inch-thick slices, spread each of half the slices    with a scant 2 tablespoons of the chicken salad, and top the chicken salad  with the remaining slices. Cut each sandwich in half. Spread a thin layer  of the mayonnaise on one of the edges of each sandwich and dip it in the  parsley.    Makes about 34 sandwiches.
