Wiener Schnitzel
olive oil, Lard, Salt, Veal slices, Fine dry bread crumbs, Flour, Eggs, 
Trim all fat from veal. Pound each slice as thin as possible (about 1/8  inch thick). Make small vertical cuts all around the edges of the veal.  Salt each slice. Dip first into a soup plate containing flour, and shake  off excess; next into a soup plate of beaten egg; finally into a soup plate  containing dried bread crumbs, pressing crumbs well in with the palm of  your hand, then shaking off excess. Fry in deep fat, half olive oil, half  melted lard, so hot that it smokes, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or  until heat is right when the breading ripples golden brown. Schnitzel is  done and tender when a fork goes right through the meat. Serve garnished  with lemon wedges and potatoes or salad as a side dish.
