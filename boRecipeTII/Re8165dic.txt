Preheat the oven to 4450 degrees. For stuffing: In a saute pan, heat the  olive oil. When the pan is smoking hot saute the onions, shallots, and  garlic for 1 minute.  Add the jalapenos, celery, and corn. Continue sauting  for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl, combine the  sauteed vegetables, crumbled corn muffins and stock together, mix until  incorporated. For the turkey: Using a small knife, make a 2-inch slit on  the side of the breast, forming a pocket. Fill each pocket with about 1/2  cup of the stuffing.  Using a potato threader from Suzy Wong, thread the  potatoes. Season each stuffed breast with Essence. Rub the entire breast  with the Dijon mustard.  On a cloth napkin folded in half, cover the bottom  half with the seasoned potato crust. Place the turkey in the center and  fold over ther remaining crust over the breast. Roll the breast up tightly  in the napkin.  This will help in holding the crust to the meat. In a saute  pan, heat the olive oil.  When the pan is smoking hot, remove the napkin  and add the potato crusted turkey. Saute for 2-3 minutes or until golden on  one side. Flip the meat over and finish cooking in the oven for 8-10  minutes.  Serve with shoestring potatoes.    Source: Essence of Emeril, #22326, TVFN Formatted by Lisa Crawford, 4/28/96
