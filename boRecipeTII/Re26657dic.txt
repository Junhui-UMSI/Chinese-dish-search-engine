Baileys Corn Wafers
Margarine; melted, Salt, Boiling water, White cornmeal, Unsalted butter, 
Preheat oven to 425F degrees. Grease 2 cookie sheets or coat with vegetable  cooking spray.    Mix cornmeal and salt in a bowl and pour in boiling water, stirring all the  while to keep lumps from forming. Stir in margarine.    Drop 1 tablespoon at the time onto the cookie sheets. This batter should be  liquid enough to spread out into a 3-inch circle. If it doesnt spread, add  a bit more water. Bake until golden brown around the edges and crispy,  about 20 minutes. Serve with sweet butter.    Makes approximately 36 wafers.    SOURCE: Lee Baileys Soup Meals (1989:isbn0517573040)    Notes: Look like a cornmeal cookie. Lees Intro: These wonderful, crisp  little wafers are so easy to prepare you will want to make them every time  you serve soup. You might vary them by adding a bit of prepared Cajun  seasoning to the batter.
