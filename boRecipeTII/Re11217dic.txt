Recipe by: John Ketola <tellall@HOOKED.NET> Cook slowly to a syrup    This is _The_ classic raisin sauce. So very simple. So very Good!    Mom used it for the 30s, 40s,50s and the 60s. I ve used this recipe  professionally and at home for 4 decades. _Only compliments!_    God Bless Fanny Farmer and the Boston Cooking School Cookbook!    P.S. I use Heinz White  (apple cider and even a good red wine vinegar  works).  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #333 by dburns@synapse.net (Dave Burnside )  on Dec 24, 1997
