Pizza Dough - for Chicago Style Bread Pizza
Yeast, Unbleached white flour, Black Pepper, Gluten flour, Warm water, Salt, Vegetable oil, 
Mix the seasonings and oil with the warm water. Add the flours and knead  until as smooth dough results. Allow to rise for 30 minutes or longer to  relax before spreading in a large Chicago style pan or 2 flat pizza pans.  Be sure to use the black pepper as it adds to the flavor. For Pesto crust,  add 2-4 tablespoons of pesto with the oil This makes a good dough in a  bread machine on the dough setting. Drizzle or brush a light coating of  olive oil over the crust. Add the tomato sauce and toppings. Bake until  just beginning to brown, and then add the cheese(s). This will tend to make  a less drippy sauce.
