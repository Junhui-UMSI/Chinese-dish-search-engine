Basics Dried Pasta
Water, Dried pasta, Salt, 
Basics for new cooks:    In large pot, cover and bring water and salt to full rolling boil. Stir in  pasta, separating pieces; return to boil and boil, uncovered and stirring  occasionally, for 8-10 minutes or until tender but firm. Drain well.    Tip: Fine strands and small shapes of dried pasta cook in as little as 3  minutes.    Tip: If pasta is to be coated with a sauce, do not rinse. The starchy  coating on pasta aids in holding sauce to the pasta.
