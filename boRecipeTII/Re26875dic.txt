Baked Beans - Vermont Style
Pea beans, Salt pork, Salt, Dry mustard, Maple syrup; or more, 
Soak beans overnight and parboil until the skins break when you blow on a  spoonful. Put bean in a bean pot and por in a mixture of the remaining  ingredients. Place the salt pork on top. Bake uncovered at 350 degrees  until the salt pork browns (about 1/2 hour). Turn oven down to 325 degrees  and bake uncovered for 6 - 8 hours. Check the beans every hour or so and  add boiling water when the beans look dry on top.    Recipe by: Marie Sautter    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Barb at PK  <abprice@wf.net> on Apr 16, 1998
