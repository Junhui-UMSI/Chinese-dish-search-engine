Select veal steaks weighting about 4 ounces each. Set aside while making  the sauce.    Saute celery, onion, pepper, garlic, and bay leaves in shortening. Add  chopped tomatoes and beef stock and simmer for 20 minutes. Dissolve  cornstarch in 3 tablespoons of water; gradually stir into sauce mixture.  Add salt and pepper to taste, and boil mixture until it thickens. Remove  from heat.    Coat veal steaks in seasoned flour.  Saute in melted lard until brown.  Arrange steaks in a baking dish, cover with sauce and bake at 350 degrees  for 30 minutes or until veal is tender. Cook grits according to package  directions and serve with veal.
