Sweetened Condensed Milk Substitute
Cups          Milk powder, Whole or 2 percent milk, Sugar, Vanilla extract, 
COOKS ILLUSTRATED 11/12/94-----    To make fourteen ounces of sweetened condensed milk substitute, whisk one  and one half cups of milk powder into a half cup of whole or 2 percent milk  in a saucepan until it is very smooth, about one minutes. Then whisk in  two-thirds cup of sugar and one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and cook over  low heat, continuing to whisk constantly until the sugar and milk powder  dissolve, about five minutes. Cool before using, then whisk again to be  sure that no graininess remains. (This can be covered and refrigerated for  up to one week)    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #289    Date: Mon, 21 Oct 1996 14:29:54 -0400    From: Martha Sheppard <MARTHAHS@postoffice.worldnet.att.net>
