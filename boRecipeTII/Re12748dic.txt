1. Boil the pork in water to cover until barely cooked. Remove,drain, and  coat with 1 tsp soy sauce.    2. Heat teh oil in a wok over a medium fire to very hot, add the pork and  deep-fry until small bubbles appear on the skin. Remove and let cool. Then  cut into slices, 1/8-inch thick, leaving some skin on each slice. Stack the  slices in a heat proof bowl, skin side down.    3. Sprinkle the star anise and ginger over the pork. Mix together with the  rice wine, salt, and 3 tsp of soy sauce, and pour over the pork. Place the  bowl in a steamer and steam over boiling water until thoroughly cooked,  about one hour.    4. While the pork steams, shell the eggs and soak them in 1 tsp soy sauce  for 10 minutes. Reheat the oil to moderatly hot and deep-fry the eggs until  golden brown. Drain, let cool slightly, and cut into halves.    5. Cover the bowl containing the pork with a serving dish turned upside  down. Invert the bowl so the pork slides onto the dish with skin side up.  Arrange the eggs around the pork and serve.    This dish gets its name from the eggs, which resemble yuan pao, the gold  ingots used as money in ancient times.    busted by sooz  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 227 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Nov 08, 1997
