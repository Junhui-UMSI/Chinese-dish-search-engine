I checked the subject list under Asian Cooking, and didnt see any I  recognized as this soup. I didnt have time to check each one individually,  so I hope this doesnt duplicate what you already have. This is from the  "Sunset Oriental Cookbook". Thinly sliced green onion, including tops  Prepare sesame seeds;place in a 5-6 qt. kettle and add ribs, broth, water,  soy, sugar, garlic, ginger,pepper, and whole onions. Bring to a boil over  med. heat;cover, reduce heat, and simmer till beef is tender (2 1/2 -3  hrs.) Lift out ribs, and let cool. Lift out and discard ginger and onions.  Skim and discard fat from broth. When ribs are cool, discard bones and fat;  then shred meat with fingers. Return meat to broth and add daikon. Bring to  boil over med. high heat;cover,reduce heat,and simmer till daikon is tender  to > bite (10-15 min.). Add oil. Gently break eggs, one at a time, into  barely simmering broth;cover and cook just till eggs are softly set ( about  2 min.). Ladle soup and eggs into individual bowls, and sprinkle sliced  onions over top. Makes 3 or 4 servings. I hope this helps. I havent had  this for a while, and Im waiting for cool weather. And in Texas, Ive got  a ways to wait!!!!! Carla in Houston RSCH32C FROM:     CARLA COOK (RSCH32C)
