Baked Cranberry Apples
Tart apples, Butter, Ground cinnamon, Orange, Pecans; toasted, Maple syrup or honey, Cranberries, 
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice tops from apples. Carefully remove  cores, taking care not to cut through to bottoms.  2. Peel skin from orange, leaving the bitter white membrane. Dice orange  peel. Juice orange. Discard membrane. Coarsely chop pecans. Drizzle 2  tablespoons of the melted butter in the bottom of a 9- by 12-inch baking  dish. In a small mixing bowl combine cranberries, orange peel, orange  juice, pecans, remaining butter, maple syrup, and cinnamon.  3. Place 1/8 of the mixture into each cored apple. Put apples into baking  dish. Cover pan with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and  bake until a knife inserted in the side of apples meets no resistance (5  minutes). Apples will be tender but should still hold their shape.
