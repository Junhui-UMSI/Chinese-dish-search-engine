Sprinkle about a third of the rice in the bottom of a 2-quart casserole  dish.  Then sprinkle on a third of the bananas and a third of the sugar on  top of them. Continue sprinkling in thirds until youre done. Pour on the  milk and creme de cacao and sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover and bake in a 375  degree pre-heated oven until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is  tender, about 1 hour.  Serve warm.    We discovered that it also tastes good cold, standing in front of the  refrigerator :-)    You can substitute skim milk or evaporated skim milk instead of whole milk.  Also, if exotic bananas arent available, substitute regular ones. I used  evaporated skim milk, regular bananas, and I think I left out the liqueur.  Arborio is the short-grained Italian rice traditionally used for risotto.  My regular supermarket does carry it. Perhaps another kind of rice would  work.
