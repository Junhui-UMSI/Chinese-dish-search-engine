Wash the barley. Place it in a large kettle with the water, and bring to a  boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour, or until the water is  absorbed.     Whle the barley is cooking, prepare the vegetables: chop the onion and  slice the carrots and parsnips, and steam them, along with the cabbage,  until they are tender-crisp.     Mix together the cooked barley and vegetables. Add the remaining  ingredients. Mix well.     Spread the mixture into an uncooked 10-inch pie shell.   Cover with the top crust. Cut a whole into the top crust to let steam  escape.     Bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.     From the files of DEEANNE
