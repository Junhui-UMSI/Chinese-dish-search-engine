Artichokes Cooked in Marinade
Whole artichokes, Garlic cloves -- cut in, Peppercorns, Red wine vinegar, Half, olive oil, Salt, 
Trim artichoke stems flat and pull off any bruised outer leaves.  Cut off  top third of artichoke and trim ends of remaining leaves. Place in pot just  large enough to hold artichokes side by side.  Pour 1 tbsp. winegar and 1  teaspoon olive oil over top of each artichoke. Add boiling water to cover,  garlic, peppercorns and salt.  If artichokes float, place a heavy heatproof  plate on top to hold them down.  Cover pot with a tight lid, and cook about  30 minutes, until tender.  Let artichokes cool in liquid. Drain artichokes  and cut in half lenghtwise.  Scoop out choke.  Serve warm, at room  temperature or chilled. This is the 1st message Ive ever sent so Im sorry  about any mistakes Ive made!
