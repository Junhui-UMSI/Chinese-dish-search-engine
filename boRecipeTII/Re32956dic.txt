Sweet Vermouth and Fruit
Mixed fruit -- * see note, Ground nutmeg, Sweet vermouth, Heavy whipping cream, 
* Use a variety of fruits. Some suggestions: melon balls, grapes (both red  and green), strawberries, sliced fresh peaches or nectarines, bananas,  raspberries.    Place the fruit in a large bowl; pour sweet vermouth over. Fold carefully  to cover all fruit with the vermouth. Let marinate, tightly covered, in  refrigerator for 2-4 hours. Just before serving, whip heavy sweet cream  until soft peaks form. Do not overbeat. Fold gently into fruit. Spoon into  decorative sherbet or dessert glasses. Sprinkle very lightly with freshly  ground nutmeg. Sprinkle with toasted coconut if you like.
