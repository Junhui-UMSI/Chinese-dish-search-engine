Banana Chocolate Chip Souffles
Egg whites, bananas, Sugar, Miniature semisweet chocolate chips, 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees and lightly butter six 3/4-cup ramekins (3  1/2-inches in diameter by 1 1/2-inches high).    In a bowl with an electric mixer beat whites until they just hold soft  peaks and gradually beat in sugar until meringue holds stiff peaks.  Coarsely grate bananas onto meringue and gently fold with chocolate chips  into meringue.    Arrange ramekins on a baking sheet and divide mixture evenly among them,  mounding it in centers. Run a knife around sides of ramekins, freeing  mixture to aid rising, and bake souffles in middle of oven until puffed and  golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve souffles immediately.
