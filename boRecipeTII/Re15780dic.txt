Abm Sourdough Dill and Onion Rye
Lecithin granules, Gluten, Red Star yeast, Dill weed (dried), Salt, Sourdough starter*, Dried onion flakes, Bread flour, Water, Rye flour, 
I just realized that I never added any sugar or dry milk. It doesnt seem  to miss them.  Next time Ill add more dill and onion. The jars were almost  empty when my baking fit struck me, so I went with what I had.    I baked it on the regular bake cycle.  It rose almost to the top of the pan  and is a lovely golden color. Tastes pretty good, too.    *Starter:  2c all purpose flour, 2 c warm water, 1 pk yeast. Combined and  left in oven all night with the light on. It doesnt have a name yet. Would  "Bubbles" be too optimistic?
