Peanut Butter Sauce
Brown sugar, Chili powder, Coconut milk, Stalk of minced lemon, Heavy soy sauce, Onion, minced, Nampla, Crunchy peanut butter, 
Bring the sauce to a boil. Remove from the heat and pour into small bowls  to serve with satays.    Note: you can substitute a green onion for the lemon grass. It just occurrs  to me ULing that Ive heard some say that substituting lemon zest for lemon  grass (apparently they have similar tastes?) is acceptable...    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.
