One of my favorite dishes using chiles chipotles is Tinga Poblana, from  Puebla in Mexico. Tinga poblana is one of those very Mexican dishes. It is  to pork what mole poblano is to turkey or chicken. The very best tinga  poblana has a deep smokey flavor which comes from both the chipotles and  from the chorizo. Without the chiles and sausage, the dish just wont be  the same. There are few things in the world better than this in a warm  tortilla, with a bit of beans, rolled up in a taco. Remove the casing from  the chorizo, break up the meat and place in a dutch oven, along with the  bacon. Fry until most of the fat is rendered. Remove all but 2 Tb grease.  Add the onion and garlic, and saute until limp. Add the tomatoes, chiles  and spices, and cook for about 5 min. Add the pork, stir well, cover  tightly and cook over medium low heat until done, approximately 1 1/2  hours. Watch carefully to see that it does not cook dry. If the sauce is  too thick, add a little water. * Chiles chipotles are available canned in  Mexican food stores. The best to use are those in adobo, as they have a  slightly smokey flavor. J. F.
