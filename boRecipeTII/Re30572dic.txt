Tagliatelle with Artichokes
Chicken or beef stock, Dry white wine, Salt and black pepper, Heavy cream; (or evaporated, Globe artichokes, olive oil, Butter, Tagliatelle, Lemon ; juice of, Grated Parmesan, Onion, 
Prepare the artichokes and drop them into a bowl of water with vinegar or  lemon to prevent darkening. Just before using them, drain, and chop.    Heat the oil and butter and gently fry the onion until soft. Keep the heat  low and cover the pan. After about 5 minutes, add the artichokes. Stir,  cover again, and cook for about 5 minutes. Now add the white wine, lemon  juice, and stock and cook covered for about 20 minutes.    Meanwhile, heat the water for the pasta. Once you have added the pasta to  the pan, add the cream to the artichoke mixture and allow to sit,  uncovered, on very low heat. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper.  The sauce will become thickened while the pasta is cooking.    Drain the tagliatelle and immediately stir in the Parmesan cheese, so that  all the pasta is cheese-coated. Immediately stir in the artichoke mixture  and toss to mix. Serve at once.    This is from Diane Seeds THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PASTA SAUCES (Ten Speed  Press, 1987).
