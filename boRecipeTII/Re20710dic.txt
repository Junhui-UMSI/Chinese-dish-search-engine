Apple Crunch #1
Baking Powder, Cinnamon, Salt, Sugar, apples, butter; melted, Flour, Brown sugar, Baking soda, Quick oatmeal, 
Place raw apples in 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with sugar & cinnamon.  Mix flour, brown sugar, oatmeal, butter, baking powder, soda & salt. Spread  over apples. Pat smooth. Bake at 300 for 1 hour. Serve warm with lemon  sauce, ice cream or whipped topping. (Our favorite way is with ice cream,  but you need to cut down a little on the sugar if you do this.)
