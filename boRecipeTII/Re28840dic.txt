Heres a recipe for both Red and Green curry  paste I got in Bangkok this March:    RED CURRY PASTE: combine first 7 ingredients in blender at medium speed  until coarse ground. In mortar combine chili, salt and blended spices and  grind to paste with pestle. Add water and grind till well mixed.    Authentic traditional Thai red chili is prepared by cutting open 6 dried  chilis and removing the seeds. Soak the pods in water for 30 minutes, drain  and squeeze out the excess water.    2 tblspn chili powder can be substituted for fresh chilis.  The Tuong Ot  Sriracha chili sauce mentioned in a previous missive will also work well.    GREEN CURRY PASTE: Prepare as above but substitute fresh green serrano  chilis for the red chilis, fresh makrood for the dried, fresh laos root for  the dried.    Makrood leaves and rind: small double leaves - figure 8 shaped with  lime-like fragrance, have a sour, strong pungent taste, are also used in  soups and thinly sliced in salads.    Laos root (kah) is very strong & sharp with penetrating odor, not unlike  eucalyptus.  kwvegan vegan    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #129    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
