Some of the recipes Ive  found here on the digest are mighty persuasive, however!    Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly spray 9" x 13" x 2" pan with cooking  spray.  Spread popcorn in pan.  Mix the remaining ingredients in a bowl and  drizzle over popcorn, stirring to coat.    Bake for 15 minutes, stirring once or twice.  The recipe says this make 6  3/4 cup servings, with 76 calories and 1 gram of fat each.  Good luck only  eating 3/4 cup!    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #71    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
