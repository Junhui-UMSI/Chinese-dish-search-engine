Vegetable Marinade 1
Fresh lemon juice (or, Handful  rosemary; thyme,, salt and pepper, Cloves  roughly chopped, olive oil, Left over lemons, 
This is a classical marinade: a marinade should have some oil so that the  object to be grilled will not stick and something acidic like wine, vinegar  or lemon juice to precook whatever you marinate. After squeezing two or so  lemons to get the juice out, keep the peel and cut it into small strips.  add these to the marinade. I like to marinate in a ziplock bag, which  rewuires less overall liquid. We recently used the zaatar varation of this  recipe to marinate some fresh asparagus. We slapped them on the grill and  had a *great* meal afterwards. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #238 by  David de Graaf <degraaf@iname.com> on Aug 24, 1997
