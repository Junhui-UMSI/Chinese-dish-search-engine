TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH6179    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix the flour and almonds together. In a  small, heavy saucepan heat the corn syrup, sugar, butter and chocolate over  low heat, stirring constantly until mixture just comes to a simmer. Remove  from the heat and stir in the vanilla, then add flour mixture and stir  until smooth.    Butter a cookie sheet and drop the dough by the spoonful, leaving at least  3 inches on all sides for spreading. Bake 4 at a time for 8 to 10 minutes,  then remove from the oven and let rest 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Lift cookies  from pan with a thin metal spatula and drape over upside-down coffee cups  to form cup-like containers for the sorbet. Continue until you have used  all the mixture. Let the shells cool completely on the coffee cups, then  stack the shells carefully and, if desired, store in airtight container for  up to 3 days.    To make the sorbet, whisk all the ingredients together in a bowl, stirring  until sugar is dissolved. Process in an ice cream maker according to the  manufacturers instructions. Keep frozen until ready to serve. Scoop a ball  of tangerine sorbet into each chocolate shell and garnish the plate with  wafer cookies, if desired.    Yield: 6 to 8 shells    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 24, 1998
