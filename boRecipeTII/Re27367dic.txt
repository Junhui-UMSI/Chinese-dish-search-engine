Butter 10 (6-ounce) custard cups or individual souffl? dishes sprinkle  lightly with sugar; set cups aside.

Stir in coconut; bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until thickened.    Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla. Cool.    Beat egg whites at high speed with an electric mixer until foamy; gradually  add 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form.  Gently stir one-fourth of custard mixture into egg whites; add to remaining  custard mixture. Spoon into prepared custard cups.    Bake at 450? for 20 to 25 minutes or until puffed and golden, shielding  with aluminum foil, if necessary. Serve immediately. Makes 10 servings.    Notes: Cloud Craft Souffl?s rely on stiffly beaten egg whites to create  their magnificent proportions. Here are a few helpful tips for high and  mighty souffl?s.    ?Separate egg yolks from whites while eggs are cold.    ?To make your souffl? rise higher, let egg whites sit at room temperature       20    minutes before beating them.    ?Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Lift beaters up from bowl to see  if peaks hold their shape.    Fold egg whites into the souffl? mixture by cutting down through the  center of the mixtures, across the bottom, and up the sides of the bowl.  Give the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat folding and turning until mixtures  are blended.
