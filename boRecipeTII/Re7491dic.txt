Cut away bottom 1/2 inch from the asparagus. Trim away thorny ends from the  asparagus using a peeler. Cut off bottom 5 inches from half of the bunch  and julienne. Place asparagus strips in boiling water for 30 seconds,  immediately remove to a bowl of ice water and set aside for later use.    Take 4 tablespoons of butter and dice into 1/2 inch cubes. Toss in with  flour to coat, remove from flour and refrigerate to keep chilled.    Remove shells from the pistachios and chop coarsely. Set aside.    Add remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to medium sized saute pan over  medium-high heat to melt and get good and hot. Add pork and cook completely  while browning nicely, turning once. Make sure the meat is fully cooked.  Remove meat to warmed oven.    (Now is the time to add all remaining asparagus to boiling water for 3  minutes and serve hot with a little melted butter.)    Combine chicken broth and wine and add to hot pan used to cook the meat.  Stir up browned bits. When liquids are boiling, add cold butter, about 1  tablespoon at a time. Using wire whisk, stir vigorously until butter melts  and is combined with sauce. Repeat in stages until all butter is used. The  sauce should now be thickened nicely.    Add julienned asparagus to the hot sauce in one portion of the saute pan to  heat.    Serve one medallion with plenty of sauce to cover along with julienned  asparagus on one side of the top of the meat. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons  of the chopped pistachios over the other side.    I served this with sauted potatoes and chives. Please let me know if you  try it.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Jim Cole <jcole@IDULAB.GOV> on Mar 2, 1998
