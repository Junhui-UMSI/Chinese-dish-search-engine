POUND GARLIC, PEPPERCORN, coriander root and salt into a paste; add oil and  mix together. Rub the garlic mixture over the beef; marinate for 30  minutes. Broil or grill beef until medium rare. Slice into 2-by-1/4-inch  strips. Set aside in a large mixing bowl. Quickly char tomatoes under a hot  broiler, turning occasionally. Do not overcook. Cool. Cut into wedges and  add to the beef. Evenly spread the sliced onions on 1/2 of the sheet of  foil. Fold in half, seal the edges to form a flat parcel. Place directly on  top of a medium-high stove burner for 1 minute--it should make sizzling  sounds. Turn over; cook for about 30 seconds longer until charred. Remove,  unwrap and cool. Add to the beef mixture. Line a platter with the large  lettuce leaves. Shred remaining leaves and scatter them on top.    TO PREPARE THE DRESSING: In a hot, ungreased skillet, toast optional ground  dried shrimp until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Reduce to medium heat. Add  garlic, chiles, roasted chile sauce (nam prik pao), fish sauce, lime juice  and sugar; stir together until dissolved. Cool. Add beef mixture, mint and  coriander to wok; toss together gently. Pour mixture over lettuce. Serve at  room temperature.
