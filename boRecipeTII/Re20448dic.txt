1. Pressure cook potato chunks and peas for about 6 minutes. 2. Dice  onions, chop ginger, green chili and garlic. 3. Heat a little oil, add  onions and saute till golden. Add chopped ginger, chopped garlic and  chopped green chili now and saute. 4. Add turmeric powder, cayenne pepper  powder and garam masala powder. Stir continuously until thoroughly mixed.  5. Add chopped tomatoes. Saute until tomato pieces are wilted. 6. Add  potatoes, peas from pressure cooker. Top with 1-and-1/2 cups of water. Add  salt according to your taste. Simmer on low heat until gravy thickens  slightly. 7. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro, squeeze a few drops of  lemon juice and serve hot.    NOTES: 1. This is a very simple thing, easy to make. 2. Total time required  is under 30 minutes.    I like this when it is accompanied by some cool cucumber-yogurt raita, or  with a salad of fresh sliced onions, tomatoes and cucumber slices.
