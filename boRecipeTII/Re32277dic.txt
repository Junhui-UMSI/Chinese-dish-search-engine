Barbeque Sauce
Onion, Paprika, Pepper, Salt, Worcestershire Sauce, Lemon juice, Brown Sugar, Catsup, Water, Butter, 
Heat all ingredients except lemon juice and worcestershire sauce. Bring to  a boil.  Add lemon juice and worcestershire sauce and heat until hot. Makes  about 2 cups.  [Variations I make: 1 Can Tomato sauce + 2 T. sugar.  Slightly less butter, or none at all. The chicken seems to produce enough  of its own fat to make up for leaving any out. 1/2 T. packed brown sugar.]  Pour over Skinned and cleaned Chicken. Cook in crockpot for about 6-8 hours  on low. 4-6 hours on high. ______
