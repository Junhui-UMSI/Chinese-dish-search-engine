Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo)
Fresh red chile pepper, Chicken broth, peanuts, Chili paste, Peanut oil, Garlic, Tomato paste, Sugar, Peanut butter, Hoisin sauce, 
This peanut sauce is somewhat different from a Thai peanut sauce.    Its not nearly as sweet and has no coconut milk in it.  Most  Vietnamese restaurants Ive eaten at serve this along with Nuoc Cham  and Carrot salad with Cha Gio type dishes.    Prepare the roasted peanuts.  Set aside.  [I use unsalted Planters  roasted peanuts.  S.C.]    Heat the oil in a small saucepan.  When the oil is hot add the garlic  chili paste and tomato paste.  Fry until the garlic is golden brown,  about 30 seconds.  Add the broth, sugar, peanut butter and hoisin  sauce and whisk to dissolve the peanut butter.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 3 minutes.    Divide the sauce among individual dipping bowls and garnish with the  ground peanuts and slice chile.  Server warm or at room temperature.  Yield: about 1 cup.    [ Be careful when frying the chili paste.  Getting a lungful of the  smoke is NO fun.  S.C.]    From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier.
