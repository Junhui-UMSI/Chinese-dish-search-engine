Treebeards Butter Cake
To 3), Mix (the one that says, Eggs (you can cut this down, Butter, Package of cream cheese, Box Pillsbury yellow cake, "Pudding in the mix"), Confectioners sugar, Vanilla, 
Preheat oven to 350. Beat the egg slightly in a mixing bowl. Melt the  butter and pour it into the bowl. Add the cake mix and mix until the  dry lumps disappear. Spread this evenly in a 9x13x21/2" cake pan. The  mixture will be stiff - like playdough - and I find it easier to use  my bare hands for spreading it and patting it down.    For the next step you will need an electric mixer or blender. Soften  the cream cheese ( I use the microwave ) and whirl away in blender  (or mixer). Add the remaining eggs and vanilla. Continue mixing while  slowly adding the sugar. Mix until creamy (this can take several  minutes).    Pour this mixture into cake pan on top of the first mix and pop into  oven. The recipe says it takes 30-35 minutes but mine took 50  minutes. The center will sink and bubble, and the sides rise up.  Remove when the top is a light brown. Watch carefully so that it  doesnt get too brown. The cake will be very soft. Wait for it to  cool and harden before cutting into small squares and eating. If you  like you can sprinkle with a tablespoon of confectioners sugar or  pecans while it is still warm.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
