Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix first four ingredients together for filling.  Combine syrup ingredients and cook until sugar dissolves and mixture turns  syrupy. Set aside to cool. Remove cinnamon stick before using.    To Assemble:    Unfold phyllo. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut phyllo sheets crosswise,  into thirds. Cover phyllo not being used with a barely damp towel. Using  two pieces of phyllo - phyllo sheets are so thin they must be doubled - and  keeping narrow ends towards you, brush with butter. Place 1 to 1 1/2  teaspoons filling 1/4 inch from end nearest you, to within 1/4 inch of  sides. Fold long sides in 1/4 inch. Fold over bottom to cover filling.    Place a clean pencil on top of fold and roll into a cigar-like cylinder.    Push both ends toward center and remove pencil. Place roll on cookie sheet  and generously brush with butter. Repeat with remaining filling and phyllo.    Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Dip hot rolls into cooled syrup -  kitchen tongs work well for this. Place onto a platter to cool. Cover and  refrigerate. Can be frozen.    SOURCE: Gifts from The Kitchen SHARED BY:Jim Bodle 8/92
