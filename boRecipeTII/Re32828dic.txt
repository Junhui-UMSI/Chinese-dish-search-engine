Mix together the eggs, cinnamon, brown sugar and heavy cream. Lay out the  dough, slice the sweet potatoes and arrange in the center of the dough  circle leaving a one and half inch border all the way around the potatoes.  Drizzle the honey over the top of the sweet potatoes and pull the edges of  the dough up on top of the outer edge of the sweet potatoes making sure  that there is a water tight seal. Slowly pour the custard over the sweet  potatoes being careful not to over flow the tart. Brush the exposed dough  with egg wash and cover the top with a mix of brown sugar and bread crumbs.  Bake at 375 degrees for approximately 45 min. or until the custard is  completely set.    MasterCook formatted by Martha Hicks using Buster 2.0d.
