Orange Crust Pie Pastry: In a large bowl, sift together the flour and salt.  Cut in the shortening and orange rind with a pastry blender until the  mixture is the texture of coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, combine 6  tablespoons of the orange juice with the sugar and nutmeg. Using a fork or  knife, cut the orange juice mixture into the flour mixture to form a soft  dough, adding additional orange juice if necessary. Do not overmix.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Roll out half the chilled dough on a  floured surface to form a crust about 10 inches in diameter. Firmly press  the crust into a pie plate. Trim edges to 3/4 inch and flute with fingers  or crimp with a fork. Repeat with the second half of the dough. Freeze or  use immediately.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 26 Jan 97 by "Ted D.
