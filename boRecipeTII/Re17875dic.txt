Aloo Gobi Aur Mater (Cauliflower with Potatoes and Peas)
Sugar, Ground cummin, Tomatoes, Peas, Garam Masala, Vegetable oil, Onions, Salt, Potatoes, Cauliflower, Ground turmeric, Chilli powder, 
1. Heat the oil in a karahi(wok) over medium high heat    2. Add the onions and fry for 3-4 minutes until light brown    3. Add the potatoes and cauliflower and stir. Add the turmeric, chilli,  cummin, tomatoes, salt and sugar. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes.    4. Add the peas, cover and reduce heat to a medium low and cook for about  20 minutes until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender. During the  cooking period stir the vegetables a few times to stop them sticking.    5. Sprinkle with garam masala.    Its that easy!    Garam Masala means "hot spices" and is a mixture of ground spices that is  used sparingly, sprinkled either on a finished dish or on to the foods just  before it has finished cooking. It is far better to grind your own spices  than to buy the mixture ready-ground. Bought garam masala often contains  inferior quality spices and will not keep its flavour for long.    For homemade garam masala, grind together cardamom seeds from 10 pods, 25g  cinnamon stick, 6 cloves and 6-8 whole black peppercorns. Store in an  airtight jar in a cool place.    Compiled by Imran C.
