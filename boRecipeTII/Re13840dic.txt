Williemels Pecan Cookies
Brown sugar, Salt, Flour, Vanilla, Pecan halves, Egg white, 
This recipe came from River Roads II, the "new" one published first in 76.  The River Roads books are still available, and now the newest one is out,  with healthier recipes.    Beat egg white until stiff. Fold in dry ingredients poured through a  strainer; add rest. Drop 2 or 3 halves per cookie on well greased sheet or  try foil or waxed paper. Bake at 275F for 20 or so minutes, until firm and  browned. I now bake this cookie on parchment paper, or the new teflon  sheets.
