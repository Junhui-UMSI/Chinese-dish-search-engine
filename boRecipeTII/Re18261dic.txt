Venison Stew #3
Carrots, Salt, Worcestershire Sauce, Paprika, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Onion, Allspice, Pepper, Potatoes, Stew meat, Bay Leaves, 
Brown the cubed meat in the oil, add two cups of water, then the rest of  the ingredients. Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours. Remove bay leaves, add  carrots and potatoes, cook another 30-45 minutes or until tender. As a  footnote, Ive just browned the meat, then dumped everything in the  "crockpot" on low. It produces a stew that tastes as tho it already been  reheated several times. IMHO, thats the best stew.
