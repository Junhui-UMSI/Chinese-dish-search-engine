A full recipe of this sauce is enough for about 1 1/2 pounds of cooked  fish, seafood or firm cubed tofu.    Place greens, pepper, tomato, cilantro, chiles and garlic in a blender or  food processor and process until smoothly pureed. Set aside.    Heat oil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add pureed mixture  and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Add the remaining  ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until  sauce is thick, 12 to 15 minutes.    Makes about 2 cups.    PER TABLESPOON: 15 calories, 0 g protein, 1 g carbohydrate, 1 g fat (1 g  saturated), 3 mg cholesterol, 41 mg sodium, 0 g fiber.
