Add chicken, onion, vinegar, garlic, oil  and cumin to pan. Simmer over very low heat until chicken is just cooked  through, about ten minutes. Transfer chicken and onions to shallow dish.    Top with bell peppers and minced chilli.  Boil cooking liquid until reduced  to 2/3 c, about ten minutes.  Pour liquid over chicken and let cool 30  minutes.  Add cilantro to chicken mixture.  Cover and refrigerate until  well chilled, turning chicken occasionally, about 4 hours (can be prepared  one day ahead). Slice chicken and transfer to plates. Top with marinated  vegetables and some of the juices. Pass tortilla chips to use as "pushers."  130 calories per serving, 4 g fat, 72 mg sodium, 44 mg cholesterol.
