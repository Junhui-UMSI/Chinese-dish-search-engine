Heres the recipe:    Put tomato sauce, peppers, garlic, and lime juice in blender, and mulch  them up good. Dice onions, add remaining ingredients mix well and put up in  clean jars. Keep refrigerated. (Keeps about 2 weeks, just about right for  our family we give some away too)    JEWISH-FOOD digest 248    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
