Boil rinsed potatoes in plenty of lightly salted water, about 15 minutes,  or until just tender. Drain and set aside.    Cut the asparagus and carrots to size before cooking. Steam each vegetable  separately (a dente).    ~Asparagus (1-1/2 to 2-inch lengths) 1-2 minutes.    ~Carrots (1/4-1/3-inch thick) 5 minutes.    Put the vegetables in a bowl and chill: to stop cooking and to cool the  potatoes enough so that they can be handled without crumbling. Slice the  red potatoes 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Prepare the dressing in a blender, food  processor, or hand-held grinder. Season with salt and freshly ground  pepper. Drizzle on the salad and toss gently to coat. Fold in the tender  shallot (or scallions; spring-green onions, sweet onion). Cover and chill  (about 2 hours). Lettuce (optional).    Cooksnote - substitute fresh rosemary for the basil. Use fresh herbs    Published by Wisconsin Trails Magazine (1988).    NOTES : Heres an eye-appealing potato salad from Wisconsin. Asparagus is  grown there.
