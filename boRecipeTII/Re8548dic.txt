Potatoes Au Gratin
Potato, Pepper, Onion, Salt, Cheese, Flour, Butter, Half-and-half, Bread crumbs, 
Heat oven to 375.  Cook and stir onion in butter in 2-quart saucepan until  onion is tender.  Stir in flour, salt and pepper. Cook over low heat,  stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth and bubbly; remove from heat.  Stir in half-and-half and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese. Heat to boiling,  stirring constantly.  Boil and stir 1 minute. Place potatoes in ungreased 1  1/2-quart casserole.  Pour cheese sauce on potatoes.   Bake uncovered until top is brown and bubbly, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Mix  remaining cheese and the bread crumbs; sprinkle over casserole. Raise  temperature to broil and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until top is crusty  and light brown, about 4 minutes. Tip: Broiling step can be omitted if you  wish.  Bake casserole uncovered 1 hour; sprinkle with cheese-crumb mixture.   Bake until top is brown and bubbly, 15 to 30 minutes. Hope this helps you  out.
