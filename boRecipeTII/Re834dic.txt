1 Place a pan of water on the hob to boil for the pasta, and grease a  shallow ovenproof dish. For the Sauce: Place the olive oil, garlic, chopped  tomatoes, oregano, balsamic vinegar, basil, salt and pepper in a small  saucepan and mix together well.    2 Place on the hob and bring to the boil. Leave to simmer for about 10  minutes until thickened and reduced.    3 For the Filling: Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the crushed garlic and  cook with the leeks for a minute until beginning to soften. Add the chicken  to the pan and cook, stirring frequently until browned and cooked.    4 Add the sheets of lasagne to the pan of boiling water. Leave to cook for  three minutes or until tender.    5 Keep stirring the water to prevent the sheets sticking together. Remove  the lasagne using tongs, and drain through a sieve.    6 Finely chop the sage and strip the leaves from the thyme sprigs. Stir  into the chicken and season well. Beat the egg and mix with half the  Parmesan. Remove the chicken from the hob and stir in the egg and cheese  mixture.    7 Spoon 1 tbsp chicken mixture into the centre of each lasagne sheet,  spreading out lengthways. Roll up from the longest end, enclosing the  filling and place in the prepared ovenproof dish seam-side down.    8 Spoon the tomato sauce over the top of the canneloni and arrange the  slices of Tallegio cheese on top. Sprinkle with the remaining Parmesan.  Place under the grill for three minutes until the cheese melts and bubbles.    9 Prepare the salad by breaking up the chicory leaves and placing in a bowl  with the watercress. Peel and segment the orange, squeezing any excess  juice over the chicory and watercress. Toss in the orange pieces, sprinkle  over the balsamic vinegar and season well.    10 Arrange the salad on a serving plate and, using a fish slice, place a  portion of canneloni on the plate, garnishing with extra basil leaves.
