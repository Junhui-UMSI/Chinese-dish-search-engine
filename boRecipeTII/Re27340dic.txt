1. Set the ice cream at room temperature for 30 minutes or until soft  enough to stir. Blend in 1/2 cup amaretto and the chopped almonds. Refreeze  for 24 hours.    2. When ready to serve, scoop into dessert dishes.  Top each with a jigger  of amaretto. Garnish with whipped cream. We make our ice cream from  scratch; if you have an ice cream machine, we suggest you use it.  Otherwise, buy the best ice cream you can find for this dessert. The  quantity of chopped almonds may be altered to suit individual preference.
