Amaretto Coconut Bread
Amaretto, Flour, Salt, Sugar, Baking Powder, Coconut milk, Tofu, Unsweetened coconut flakes, 
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease a 9" x 5" x 3" loaf pan.    Blend together tofu and sugar thoroughly in an electric mixer or by mashing  them together in a large mixing bowl with the utensil of your choice.  :-)    Mix Amaretto and coconut milk into tofu until well blended.    Meanwhile, sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Toss in coconut  flakes, then add dry ingredients to liquid mixture and blend thoroughly.    Spoon batter into prepared loaf pan.  Bake until done, about 50 minutes.  Cool slightly before removing from pan.    Toasted slices of this bread are very nice with tea, coffee, or your fave  hot beverage.    [Note: 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 1/4 cup of water may be substituted  for the 1/4 cup of Amaretto. 1 1/2 cups water plus 1/4 cup oil may be used  instead of coconut milk.]    (C) Copyright 1994 Karen Mintzias - May be freely distributed
