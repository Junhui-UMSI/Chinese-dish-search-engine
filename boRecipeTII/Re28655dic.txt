Can you believe Southwest VA is in the middle of no where so if one wants a  brisket you have to special order it???? I couldnt believe it! I do a  Fajita Marinade on brisket then smoke it. I used to live in Texas. Yes  Texas first in Victoria, then moved to Lake Livingston (Houston Area)Where  my smoker was stolen.    marinate at least 3 hours then grill or smoke beef. Brisket marinate 6 hrs.  Reserve marinade and add 1 large onion sliced, 1 green and 1 red pepper  sliced, 2 small yellow hook squash sliced lengthwise, 1 zucchini squash  sliced lengthwise. When the meat is almost ready to come off the smoker  place grilling screen on grid. Add marinated veggies & grill. Serve with  salsa and sour cream    Posted to bbq-digest by "H.
