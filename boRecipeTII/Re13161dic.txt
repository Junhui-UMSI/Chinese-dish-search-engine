Wonton Skins
-(up to), Egg, -(up to), Water, Flour, Salt, 
1. Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Make an indentation or well in the  center.    2. Beat egg lightly; then pour into well and blend in.    3. Sprinkle with cold water and, wetting the hands once or twice, knead  mixture to a smooth dough.    4. Place the dough in a bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Refrigerate 30  minutes to an hour.    5. Sprinkle a board with cornstarch or flour. With a rolling pin, roll out  the dough in a forward motion, away from you, until it is paper-thin and  its edges are even in thickness. (The wonton skins should be  semi-transparent.)    6. Cut the dough in 2- to 3-inch strips. Flour them lightly; then stack one  atop the other. Cut crosswise through the stack to make 2- to 3-inch square  skins.    7. Place skins on a tray. Cover with a damp cloth until ready to use.    NOTE: If the dough is either too moist or insufliciently floured, the skins  will stick to one another in step 6.
