Two Crusted Pie Dough (Mf)
All purpose flour, Chilled shortening, cut into, Ice water, (up to 4), Chilled butter, cut into, Salt, Flour for rolling out, 
In the bowl of a food processor process the flour with some salt. Add the  chilled shortening and butter at once and pulse the machine for 15 seconds  until the fat is broken up into oatmeal sized pieces.    Add 2 tablespoons of ice water and process; if the dough is dry, add more  water, one tablespoon at a time. Be sure your dough holds together and  absorbs enough water. If it is too dry youll have a hard time rolling it  out.    Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other and  roll out larger half into a 12inch circle.    Line a 10inch deep glass pie plate with the 12-inch circle and chill the  dough. Roll out other half into a 10 1/2inch round for top crust and  transfer to a baking dish and refrigerate.
