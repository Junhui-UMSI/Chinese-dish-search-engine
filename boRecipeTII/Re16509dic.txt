African Fish Curry Powder
Mustard seeds, Dry red chiles, Coriander seeds, Turmeric, Cumin, 
Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the heavy  influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa. Curry powders are made  from different proportions of spices, dried and ground. Spices can be dried  in the sun for two to three days, in a low temperature oven, or on top of  the stove in a dry skillet. If using a skillet be sure to shake the spices  constantly so they dont burn. Grinding is usually done with a mortar and  pestle. Curry powders are not necessarily hot, they are made that way by  the addition of chili peppers. Dry spices, grind to a powder and seal in an  airtight container. Use 2 teaspoons of curry powder to every 400 g or 1 lb  of fish.
