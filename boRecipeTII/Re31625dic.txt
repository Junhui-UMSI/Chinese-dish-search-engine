Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Press the cottage cheese through a  sieve.  In a large mixing bowl, beat together the cottage cheese, Swiss  cheese, butter, flour, cornstarch and sugar blending well. Add the egg  yolks, one at a time, at low speed mixing well after each addition. In  another large mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks  and fold them gently into the cheese mixture. Pour the mixture into the  prepared crust and bake for 45 minutes. The cake will rise above the top of  the pan, then settle down again. Cool in the oven with the door propped  open, then chill.
