Banana Molasses Muffins
Light Molasses Or Syrup, Egg; Large, Unbeaten, Shortening, Melted, Bananas; Ripe, Md, Sugar, Baking soda, Baking Powder, Walnuts; Chopped, Optional, Whole wheat flour, Salt, 
Mash the bananas until no lumps remain.  Add the unbeaten egg, mixing  well.  Beat in the sugar, molasses and the shortening. (NOTE:  The secret  of this recipe is to mix the above ingredients well until very smooth.)  Sift the flour, baking power, soda, and salt together and add to the  liquid mixture.  As these are a quick bread, do not beat the dry mixture  into the liquid but rather fold it in only until it is moistened and no  streaks remain.  Spoon the mixture into a muffin tin that has been sprayed  with a non-stick coating.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or  until done.  Serve warm.
