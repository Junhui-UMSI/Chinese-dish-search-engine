Quince-And-Cranberry Compote
Cloves, Orange peel strip, Quince, Cranberry juice (optional), Whole allspice berries, Cinnamon stick (3" long), Balsamic vinegar, to taste, Water, Sugar, Cranberries, 
CUT EACH QUINCE INTO QUARTERS, then cut quarters into pieces about 1/2-inch  thick. Grasp each piece firmly and cut away peel and core with sharp knife.  When all slices have been cored and peeled, cut each piece into small  chunks. Dont worry about the fruit discoloring. In saucepan, combine  water, sugar, spices and orange peel. Bring mixture to boil, stirring to  dissolve sugar. Add quince. Reduce heat, cover pan and cook very slowly  until fruit has turned a deep pink color, about 2 hours. You dont need to  worry about overcooking as the fruit will hold its texture well. If cooked  slowly, there should still be quite a bit of liquid in pan when fruit is  done. Sort through cranberries, remove those that are not in good shape and  rinse the rest. Add cranberries to cooked quince. If mixture seems too dry,  add a little more water or cranberry juice. Increase heat a little and cook  cranberries until they begin to pop open, 12-to-15 minutes. Use rubber  scraper to gently mix them with quince. When done, refrigerate compote to  cool, then stir in enough vinegar to balance the sweetness.
