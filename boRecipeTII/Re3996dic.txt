Peppered Pan-Broiled Beef
Dried rosemary; crushed, Walnut oil, Dry brandy, Whipping cream, Unsalted butter, Beef fillet (tenderloin), Double-strength beef broth, Chopped shallots, Drained; crushed pickled, Fresh ground white pepper, Dijon-style mustard, 
Preheat oven to hottest temperature--500 to 550 degrees. Grind white pepper  generously over entire surface of beef, then rub with oil & press in  rosemary. Melt butter in large, heavy skillet until smoking hot; add beef &  cook quickly, turning as needed, until dark brown all over. Transfer beef  to roasting pan and roast 12-15 minutes or until flesh yields readily when  pressed (for rare) or yields slightly (medium-rare). While meat roasts,  make sauce: Add shallots to butter & meat drippings remaining in skillet &  cook until lightly browned, then add broth, mustard, cream & green  peppercorns. Bring to a boil, boil until slightly reduced. Add brandy &  ignite. Continue to reduce sauce, stirring constantly. When beef is done,  sauce should be done. To serve, slice beef, drizzle sauce over center of  slices. Makes 4 to 6 servings.    From the <Hotter Than Hell!>, by Jane Butel, ISBN 0-89586-646-3  (0-89586-542-4 paperback).
