Chop the shallots and place  half to one side. Chop the chillies (discarding seeds if a lesser heat is  desired), ginger, galangal and garlic and grind together with half the  shallots and 50ml of thin coconut milk. Pour this paste over the meat and  stir to ensure even coating. Set aside for at least 30 minutes. Then heat  the oil in a large frying pan and saute the remaining shallot until soft  (the longer taken over this step will greatly enhance the end result). Add  the meat and marinade and the coriander, cumin salt and pepper.. Saute this  mixture briefly then add the remaining thin coconut milk and bring to the  boil stirring continuously, then lower heat and allow to simmer until the  meat is tender. Finally add the thick cocnut milk and continue to cook  (uncovered) over medium heat until the liquid is almost completely  absorbed.
