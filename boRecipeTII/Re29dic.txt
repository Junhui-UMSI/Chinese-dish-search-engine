To make marinade:    Combine onions, leeks and chilies in a food processor. Add gingerroot and  garlic and process to thick paste. Transfer to large nonreactive bowl -  glass or stainless will work or I marinade in a large thick zip lock or  plastic bag.    Mix in remaining ingredients and set aside.      To make turkey:    Rinse the turkey under cold running water. Pat dry. Loosen turkey skin by  gently easing finger under skin at the neck. Gradually work hand under skin  to loosen without tearing it. Season turkey with salt and pepper. Place 1/3  marinade inside turkey.   Gently place 1/3 marinade under skin, being very  careful not to tear the skin. Brush remaining marinade all over bird.    Transfer to nonreactive pan.   Cover with aluminum foil or put em in that  plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.    Place remaining ingredients including 2 cups stock in roasting pan.   Unwrap turkey and place on rack in pan. Roast turkey at 325F degrees 3 1/2 to 4  hours, basting frequently with pan juices and adding additional broth if  needed.      OR Place turkey in smoker over soaked applewood chips. I much prefer  the flavor of the smoked meat to roasting. Be sure and cover turkey with  cheesecloth prior to placing in smoker. Spray bird down with fine mist of  water every 30 minutes.    When turkey is done, let stand 20 minutes before carving. (For roasted  turkey strain pan juices) and serve seperately. For smoked turkey gently  remove the dress of cheesecloth. This bird will fall apart its so juicy.  The left overs make the best enchilada or tamales ever.
