Pork Chops Italiano
Green pepper, Onion, Bay leaf, Oil for frying, Salt and pepper, Pork loin, Tomato soup, condensed, 
Heat the oil in a saucepan or frying pan (choose one with a lid). Season  both sides of the chops with salt and pepper to taste. Brown the chops  quickly on both sides. Remove from the pan.    Fry the onions until soft, but not brown.  You may need to add a little  more fat, but I prefer to use as little as possible. Return the chops to  the pan, add the tomato soup, green pepper and bay leaf. Bring to the boil,  then simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, or until the chops are cooked.    NOTES:    *  Pork chops simmered in tomato and onion -- Apologies to anyone of  Italian descent, Im sure this dish will seem a slander on your culinary  heritage, but thats the way I learned this recipe.    As much as I like grilled pork chops, I enjoy a change. This recipe isnt  haute cuisine, but I think it is particularly good when you get home from  work on a cold, wet evening. The preparation is fairly quick, and it leaves  you time to warm up in front of the fire with a cup of tea and read a  newspaper.    *  I serve this with rice.  If you like brown rice, it has the advantage of  taking as long to cook as the rest of the meal, so you get an uninterrupted  half-hour.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes cooking.  : Precision:  No need to measure.    : Stephen Withers,  : University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia  : stephenw@murdu.oz    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
