These puffs may be made with a tsp-ful of batter to yield many tiny puffs,  which are ideal crunchy hot hors doeuvres. For an excellent luncheon dish,  serve large puffs with a creamed mushroom sauce.    Finely chop the tuna in a wooden chopping bowl. Add the chopped almonds.  Mix together and set aside.    In a medium sized saucepan, pour the cup of tuna liquid and water mixture,  add the oil, salt, parsley, grated onion and pepper. Bring to a boil. Add  the cup of matzo meal all at once. Beat rapidly over low heat until the  mixture leaves the sides of the pan and forms a smooth compact ball. Set  aside to cool a bit.    Add the eggs one at a time, beating hard with a spoon after each addition,  until the mixture is shiny. Add the tuna mixture. Blend thoroughly.    Drop the mixture by the heaping tbs-ful onto a greased baking sheet. Do not  crowd them; leave room for expansion.    Bake in a preheated 450 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Turn the heat down to  350 degrees F and continue baking for an additional 30-45 minutes, until  brown. Serve hot. Yields 22-24 puffs.
