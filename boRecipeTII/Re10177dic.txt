Make the pastry in the usual way, roll  out thinly and use to line a greased 18cm flan ring.  Spread the flaked  crabe meat over the base of the pastry case and sprinkle with chopped  fennel leaves. Lightly whisk together the milk, cream, eggs, a few drops of  anchovy essence, salt, pepper and tomato puree. Pour this mixture over the  crab and fennel. Bake in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the  heat to 180 oC (350 oF) for further 25 minutes (or until the quiche is  golden and set).
