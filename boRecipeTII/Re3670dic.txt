With oil-coated hands, roll shrimp filling  into walnut-size balls.  Heat a pan of water to simmering. Drop in shrimp  balls a few at a time and simmer gently until they float (about four to  five minutes).  Drain and discard liquid.  If made ahead, cool, cover, and  refrigerate up to two days.   Soup - Cover bean threads with warm water and let stand for 30 minutes.  Drain, then place on a cutting board and cut in 6" lengths. In a 2-quart  pan heat chicken broth, sherry and soy just to boiling. Add bean threads  and mushrooms and simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes. Add snow peas and cook  for two minutes.  Add shrimp balls and cook just until heated through.  Garnish with cilantro and season to taste with salt.
