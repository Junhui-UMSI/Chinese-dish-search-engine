Pine Furniture Cleaner
Mineral oil, Pine oil, CHEAPER AND BETTER, Warm water, SOFT SOAP, 
** Unlike a simple polish which just shines your fine wood, this cleaner  will remove some dust residue while returning shine to the finish. For  heavily soiled furniture or wood, wash first will ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER and  then follow up with this solution to bring back the shine.    Mix mineral and pine oils in a glass or enamel bowl. Stir in the SOFT SOAP  and warm water, continuing to stir until all ingreds are thoroughly mixed.  Pour into clean qt size jar or bottle, cap and label. Keep out of the reach  of children.    To Use: Pour about 1T of the solution onto a soft cloth and then polish.  Turn the cloth frequently, adding more solution if necessary, to clean the  wood. Finish by buffing with a clean, dry cloth. Repeat the process if the  wood is especially soiled, but do not allow the wood to become soaked. If  youre working with FINE FURNITURE, USE A MINIMUM OF CLEANING SOLUTION AND  CLEAN WITH GENTLE STROKES.    Note: Never use any cleaning solution made with ammonia to wash your  furnitrue because the ammonia will dissolve whatever kind of finish is on  the wood.    Big savings.
