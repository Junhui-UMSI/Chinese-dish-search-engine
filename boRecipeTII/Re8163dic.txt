Potato Crusted Red Snapper
Essence, Dijon mustard, red snapper, Garnish:, Red pepper coulis, White potatoes, Salt and white pepper, Yellow pepper coulis, parsley, fresh, olive oil, Fried herb salad, 
Season each fillet with Essence. Lightly brush each fillet with the Dijon  mustard. Pass each halved potato through the potato threader or grate  potatoes using a box grater. Place the threaded potatoes in a mixing bowl  and season with salt and pepper. Divide the threaded potatoes into 4  portions. Wrap each fillet with each individual portion of the threaded  potatoes. Wrap the fish like a package. Wrap crosswise first and then  lengthwise. Wrap the crusted fish tightly in a cloth napkin. This will  secure the potato to the fish. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil.  When the oil is hot, saute the fish for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until  golden. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the  fish with Essence.
