Tomato and Basil Risotto
Vegetable oil, Unsalted butter, Onion, Arborio rice, Pepper, Chicken Stock, White wine, Plum tomatoes, Unsalted butter, Salt, Parmesan cheese, Fresh basil, 
To Prepare the fresh tomatoes, drop them into boilg salted water (the salt  helps to retain the red color) for 30 seconds, then immediately run them  under cold water. With a knife, peel the skins off and scrape our the seeds  with a speen , or squeeze the tomatoes to remove the cores. (Personally I  perfer to use a swivel peeler to peel to tomatoes and squeeze the seeds  out, they retain their flavor much better this way!) Coarsely chop the  tomatoes.    Heat the butter (first 2 tablespoons) in a skillet over moderate heat and  add the tomatoes. Cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until the tomatoes become tender  andturn a red-orange color. Add salt and pepper to taske. Turn off the heat  and set aside.    Bring the broth to a steady simmer in a saucepan on top of the stove.    Heat the butter and oil in a heavy 4-quart casserole over moderate heat.  (Instead of a casserole, we just use a sauce pan that will hold the  finished product.) Add the onion and saute for 1 or 2 minutes, until it  begins to soften, being careful not to brown it.    Add the rice to the onions; using a wooden speen, stir for 1 minute, making  sure all the grains are well coated. Add the wine and stir until it is  completely absorbed. Begin to add the simmering broth, 1/2 cup at a time,  stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed  before adding the next 1/2 cup, reserving about 1/4 cup to add at the end.  Stir frequently to preven sticking.    After approximately 18 minutes, when the rice is tender but still firm, add  the reserved broth and the tomatoes. Turn off the heat and immediately add  the remaining condimenti-Parmesan and basil-and stir vigorously to combine  with the rice. Serve Iimmediately.    VARIATION: Add a pince a saffron to the rice when you begin to add the  broth. It will lend an intese orage hue to the risotto.  ___________________________________________________________________ OUR  NOTES TO THIS:    Always use fresh plum tomatoes, and use the swivel peeler to peel them.  When you use to boiling water method, the tomatoes start to cook.    Dont saute the tomatoes first. Instead add 1/3 to 1/2 of the tomatoes  early in the rice cooking period along with a pinch of basil. Add the rest  of the uncooked tomatoes and basil at the very end, long enough to get them  warmed and juices flowing.    We use about 1/4 - 1/3 cup fresh basil to make this with (for 3/4-1 cup of  rice) and 3 or 4 tomatoes.
