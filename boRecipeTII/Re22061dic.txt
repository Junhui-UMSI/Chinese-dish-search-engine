On each tortilla mound 1/4 cup of the turkey, 1 tablespoon of the  Cheddar, 1 tablespoon of the onion, and 1 teaspoon of the chopped  coriander, roll up the tortillas jelly-roll fashion, and arrange the  enchiladas, seams side down, in a shallow 3-quart baking dish. Pour the  chili sauce over the enchiladas, sprinkle the enchiladas with the remaining  2 1/4 cups Cheddar, and bake them in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 15  to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Sprinkle the enchiladas with  the remaining chopped coriander. Serve the enchiladas on heated plates,  garnished with the avocado, peeled and diced, and the coriander sprigs.  Yield: 4 to 6 servings    RED CHILI SAUCE: In a large saucepan simmer the chilies, onion, and garlic  in the water for 20 minutes. Transfer half the chilies, onion, and garlic  with tongs to a blender, add 3/4 cup of the cooking liquid, and puree the  mixture until it is smooth. Force the puree through a sieve into a bowl,  pressing hard on the solids with a spoon. Repeat the procedure with the  remaining chilies and 3/4 cup of the remaining cooking liquid, stir in salt  to taste, and discard the remaining cooking liquid. The sauce may be made 2  weeks in advance and kept covered and chilled. Yield: About 3 1/2 cups    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 03 Dec 96    From:    "Marie D.
