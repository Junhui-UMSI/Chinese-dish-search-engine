Core and slice apples and put them in a greased pie dish. Sprinkle with  cinnamon, drizzle on molasses and dot with butter. Cover with biscuit dough  rolled to about 1/2 inch in thickness. Cut vents so steam can escape. Bake  at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. Serve hot cutting squares of biscuit as a  base for the fruit mixture. Serve with whipped cream sprinkled with nutmeg.    Instead of rolling out the dough, drop it from a spoon over the filling.  This allows the gooey sauce to bubble up around the dough.
