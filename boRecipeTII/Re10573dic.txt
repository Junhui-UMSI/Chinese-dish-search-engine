Quick Mix Pizza Dough
Water, olive oil, All-purpose flour, active dry yeast, Sugar, Salt, 
(Recipes that call for the 15-inch round Baking Stone may also be prepared  on the 12x15-inch Rectangle Baking Stone.)          Heat water and oil to 120 degrees. Combine 1-1/2 cups flour, yeast,  sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add warm water mixture and beat with  an electric mixer for 3 minutes. Stir in an additional 1-1/2 cups flour by  hand to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface. Knead dough for 10  minutes, adding the remaining 1/2 cup flour as needed to keep dough from  sticking. Dough should be smooth and elastic, but not sticky when kneading  is complete. Shape dough into a ball and place in a large greased bowl,  turning dough over to grease top. Cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a  warm place until doubled in size, about 45-60 minutes.     Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Punch dough down and divide in half. Dough  may be frozen at this point for later use if desired. Press half the dough  out into a 13-14 inch circle directly on the Baking Stone. A rolling pin  may be used if desired. Form a thick ridge around the edge to hold the  toppings. Prick the surface of the dough thoroughly with a fork. Par-bake  the crust for 10-15 minutes until lightly browned. Add your favorite  toppings and bake an additional 10-15 minutes until crust is crisp and  cheese is lightly browned. Yields 2 crusts.
