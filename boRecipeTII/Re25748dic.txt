Babaganoush (My Doctored Version)
Tahini *, Ground pepper, Juice of 1/2 Lemon, garlic, Salt, Parsley, parsley, celery, chili pepper, Ground coriander, Black olives, Ground cumin, Eggplant, Onions, Red sweet pepper, olive oil, 
* Sesame paste. Ive heard of substituting peanut butter, but never tried  it.    The variable amounts of ingredients depend on your taste and on the size  of the eggplant. Try it without celery and red pepper and then you can  decide if you want to use it next time.   Saute onions, (celery & red pepper) till starting to brown (I do in a  wok). Add eggplant and garlic, stir well, add spices (not the salt), stir  again and on very low fire, saute. May drop some liquid, thats all right,  let it evaporate, and saute slowly until everything is very tender. Keep  checking, its better if it browns a little, but needs stirring so it  doesnt burn. If its too dry, add a few TBs liquid at a time (I use  vegetable broth, liquid from steaming veggies, or liquid from microwaving  mushrooms, etc. but water would probably do). Add salt, tahini and lemon  juice, pulse a few seconds at a time in food processor or mash with potato  masher -- can be slightly lumpy, too smooth is pretty awful.Add green  stuff, pulse once or twice to chop coarsely and distribute or chop coarsely  and stir in.   Its an ugly color, so I try to dress it up with a lemon slice, greens and  black olives, seems to help. Serve with quarters of pita bread or mini  pitas, its finger food, a great appetizer with a curry meal
