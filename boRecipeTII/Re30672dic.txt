Tamales and Nactamales
Chicken broth, corn meal, Baking Powder, Tomato skins, Anise, Salt, Corn husks, Lard, 
1. In two cups of water, boil the tomato skins with the anise. Drain and  save the water.    2. In a pot, put the corn meal, and add a little salt and baking powder.  Heat the lard until semi-melted and add it to the above mixture. Begin to  form the dough, gradually adding the chicken broth and water (in which the  tomatoes were cooked) until the dough forms a uniform consistency and  little balls of the dough may float in water without separating.    3. Place a portion of the dough in the corn husks and wrap them up. Steam  for a half hour.    Nactamales: Place a portion of the dough in each each corn husk. Add green  mole, red mole, picadillo or strips of poblano peppers with cheese. Cover  with more dough, and wrap it into a tamal. Steam for a half hour.
