Turn bird over and simmer, covered, 15 minutes more.    3. Turn off heat and let stand, covered, 30 minutes. (Do not remove lid.)    4. Drain, reserving liquid for stock. Let bird cool; then refrigerate. Chop  in 2-inch sections, or carve Western-style. Serve with dips for white-cut  chicken. (See following recipes for "... Dip for Chicken": "Soy-Oil",  "Oil-Salt", "Chicken Fat-Soy", "Garlic-Soy", "Mustard-Soy" or "Hoisin".)    NOTE: Some cooks, after step 3, rinse the bird under cold running water to  make the skin smooth and firm.
