Cover the ancho chiles with warm water. Weight down with a plate to  submerge. Let stand 1 hour to soften. In a large stockpot, heat the olive  oil. Add the onions, leeks, carrots, celery, parsnips, potatoes, and  mushrooms. Saute until they just begin to color. Drain the anchos andremove  the seeds and stems; then add them to the stockpot along with the spice  seeds, herbs, tomatoes, red wine, and water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the  heat and simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour. Season with salt and  pepper. Strain carefully, to remove all the solids. Cool. The stock can be  covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or frozen  indefinitely. Note: If more "heat" is desired, leave half the seeds in the  ancho chiles. The seeds of chiles contain more of the heat than the flesh.
