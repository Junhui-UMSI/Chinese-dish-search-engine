Puerto Rican Turkey
Salt, Dry mexican oregano, Garlic, Pepper, Red wine vinegar, olive oil, 
Give this a try. I usually do it with a whole turkey, but have also done it  with turkey breast as well as large roasting chickens with equal success.  Its my Puerto Rican turkey recipe that you may have, but in case you  dont.....(g) In a blender, puree 12 cloves of garlic, 10 tsp dry Mexican  oregano, 12 tsp olive oil, 12 tsp red wine vinegar, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp  pepper. This mixture will be about the consistency of mayonnaise. Then,  "slather" the inside and outside of the turkey breast with the mixture,  using all of it. Place in a baking pan, cover tightly and bake at 350~ for  1/2 hour. Uncover and continue roasting until tender (time will depend on  the size of the breast or bird). Baste about every 15 minutes with the pan  juices.    I think youll enjoy this. Its one of the few ways Ive done a whole  breast that hasnt resulted in the cardboard effect (g).
