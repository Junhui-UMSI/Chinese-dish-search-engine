Remove from the heat and whisk in the  chilli sauce and sugar. Gradually, add both the oils until the sauce is the  right consistency for pouring - depending on the peanut butter, you may not  need all the oil.    Poach the chicken breasts for about 10 minutes (until cooked through) in  the stock, then drain and cool. Then cut into 1 inch shreds and put to one  side.    Peel the carrot and cut into shreds, also about 1 inch long, then cut the  spring onions to the same size, using the green and the white. Cut the  cucumber into 1 inch lengths, leaving the skin on. Thinly slice lengthways  and cut into matchstick shapes, discarding the seeds. Arrange the  vegetables on a serving dish and pile the chicken on top. Then pour the  sauce generously over the chicken and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
