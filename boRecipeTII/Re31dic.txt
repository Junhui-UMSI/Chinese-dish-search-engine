I want to share a slaw recipe that I have developed over the last 12  months. It is a result of extensive research on the net - combining/testing  various patterned ingredients that appear or make up "famous" slaws from  elite restaurants and hotels all over the country.   It is absolutely the best slaw I have ever had. Lots of requests and very simple to make.    Place the pre-packaged (Dole is excellent) 1 lb slaw mix in a large bowl,  add the onion, apple and celery - dice to desired consistency. Combine with  the following dressing recipe. Store in an air-tight container.      Hint: Be sure to Check the expiration dates on pre-packaged slaw mixes. The grocer will  often place his older stock in the front to "move it." Search around for  the date furthest away from the day you shop.
