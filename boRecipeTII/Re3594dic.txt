Pecan-Coated Roast Pork Loin with Baked Peaches
Garlic, peach  , nutmeg, Peacan, Powered sage, Boneless loin of pork, olive oil, Dark brown sugar, salt and pepper, 
Rub the pork throughly with olive oil.  Combine the sage, thyme, garlic,  salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar in a food processor or  blender and pulse until you have a thick paste. (You may have to add a  drizzle of olive oil to get it started). Slather the paste over the pork  loin, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate it overnight. Preheat oven to  400 degrees.  Roll the pork loin in the chopped pecans and place it in a  roasting pan.  Make a tent of aluminum foil and arrange it over the pork  loin, covering the nuts completely so that they wont char. Roast for 30  minutes; then lower the heat to 350 degrees. After 30 more minutes, place  the peach halves around it in the bottom of the roasting pan. Sprinkle with  remaining brown sugar and a grinding of nutmeg. After 20 more minutes,  remove foil and continue to roast until the pork is done, about 20 minutes  more.
