Arrange the ladyfingers on a plate and lightly soak them with the cooled  espresso.  Put half of the soaked ladyfingers in one layer in a rectangular  serving dish.  While the ladyfingers are soaking, beat the egg yolks with  the sugar until the yolks turn pale in color. Add the marscapone, the  liquors, and the extract, and stir gently. In a separate bowl, beat the egg  whites with a wire whisk until they are stiff. Gently fold the whites into  the marscapone mixture. Use half of this mixture to make a layer on top of  the ladyfingers in the serving dish. Sprinkle with half of the chopped  chocolate. Repeat the procedure with another layer of soaked ladyfingers,  the marscapone mixture, and chocolate. Cover with tin foil and refrigerate  for at least 1 hour before serving.
