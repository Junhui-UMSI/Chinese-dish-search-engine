Velvet Fudge Souffle
Unflavored gelatin, Semisweet chocolate chips, Sweetened whipping cream, Chilled whipping cream, Sugar, Egg whites, Sweet red wine, Salt, Sugar, Egg yolks, 
Extend height of 1-quart souffle dish 3 inches above  dish with band of double thickness aluminum foil;  secure ends of foil by folding together, taping or  fastening with paper clips.   Mix 1/2 cup sugar, the gelatin, salt and wine in  2-quart saucepan. Beat egg yolks slightly; stir yolks  and chocolate chips into gelatin mixture. Cook over  medium heat, stirring constantly, just until mixture  boils.   Chill pan in bowl of ice and water or refrigerator,  stirring occasionally, just until mixture mounds  slightly when dropped from a spoon, 20 or 30 minutes.  Mixture should be slightly thicker than unbeaten egg  whites. If mixture becomes too thick, place pan in  bowl of hot water, stirring constantly, until mixture  is of proper consistency.   Beat egg whites until foamy in large mixer bowl. (Egg  whites should be at room temperature when beaten for  best volume.) Gradually beat in 1/2 cup sugar; beat  until stiff and glossy. (Do not underbeat.) Fold  thickened gelatin mixture into meringue.   Beat 1 1/2 cups cream in chilled small mixer bowl  until stiff; fold into meringue mixture. Carefully  turn into souffle dish. Refrigerate until set, about 8  hours.   Just before serving, run knife around inside of foil  band and remove band. Garnish souffle with sweetened  whipped cream.
