Rainies Baked Catfish
Honey, Catfish; ready to cook, (up, Stick margarine, Kraft; (8 oz.) Zesty Italian, 
1)    2) Arrange fish in a baking pan. I use a jelly roll pan. In a shaker-type  container, combine dressing and honey. Shake well to blend. You may double  the dressing and honey and keep a reserve on hand.    3) In a small saucepan, melt margarine. Pour dressing mixture into  margarine, keeping burner on low heat. Add seasoning and pepper. Keep  stirring in order to keep it blended.    4) While constantly stirring, spoon mixture over fish making sure to coat  them well. Continue until using entire mix. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to  30 minutes or until fish is done.    5) Stop topping 1/2 way through to "re-spoon" the mixture over the fish.  This is absolutely delicious even if you dont like baked fish.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 628 by "Joe"  <Broutek@worldnet.att.net> on Jan 29, 1998
