Baked Tomatoes Stuffed with Salmon, Garlic, and Capers
garlic, italian flat-leaf parsely, Capers, Salt, Salmon, tomatoes, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Black pepper, Fine, dry, unflavored bread, 
Drain the capers if packed in vinegar; soak, rinse, and drain if packed in  salt; then chop them fine.    Turn the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the salmons skin, remove any loose  membranes, and carefully pick out all bones. Cut the fish into very small  dice and put it in a bowl together with 2 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil, the  chopped parsley, garlic, capers, 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs, salt, and  several grindings of black pepper. Toss thoroughly.    Wash the tomatoes, cut them in half horizontally, scoop out all the seeds  and the centers to make a cup-like hollow. (If you are cooking anything  else that day or the next that calls for fresh tomatoes, use the scoopings  in the recipe.)    Pat the inside of the tomatoes with paper towels to soak up excess juice,  then stuff them with the salmon mixture, pressing it down lightly as you do  so. There should be enough to form a mound. Sprinkle the tops with the  remaining bread crumbs and drizzle with the remaining olive oil, holding  back a few drops to smear the bottom of a baking pan. Place the tomatoes on  the baking pan and bake in the upper level of the preheated oven for 35  minutes or until the salmon stuffing has formed a light golden crust. Serve  not piping hot, but lukewarm. They are also good later, at room  temperature, but not reheated.    Yield: 4 appetizer servings    Notes: Recipe courtesy of Marcella Hazan, "Marcella Cucina"    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9007    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #916 by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Nov 19, 1997
