Barbecued Smoked Sausage and Lima Beans
(14 1/2 ounce) stewed, Chili powder, Ground ginger, Salt, 5-inch smoked, Onion, (10 ounce) frozen Fordhook, Brown Sugar, Cider vinegar, Dry mustard, olive oil, 
In heavy 9-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat. With fork, pierce  sausages all over serveral times. Add sausages and onion; cook, turning  sausages and stirring onion occasionally, until lightly browned--about 4  minutes.    Add limas, tomatoes, brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, chili powder, ginger,  and salt; cover and heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring  occasionally, until limas are tender--10 to 12 minutes.    To serve, with tongs, lift sausages and arrange on top of beans; serve from  skillet.    NOTES : A spicy-sweet sauce stands up to the smoky flavor the  turkey-and-duck sausages used to make this old-fashioned supper.
