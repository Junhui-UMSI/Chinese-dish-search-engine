To make a bread more cake-y, try using a substantial amount of barley flour  with perhaps some brown rice flour, and omit the wheat.  Barley flour makes  a yeast bread with a very soft, cake-like texture.    Of course you will want to add gluten.  I am allergic to wheat, though not  to gluten.  I have found that when using low-gluten flours if  I add 1/2  cup vital wheat gluten to 2 1/2 cups low-gluten flour I get a fine-textured  loaf.  It does not rise much, but the texture is wonderful! [Susan]    Mix raisins with scotch.  Place wet group in pan,  dry group on top, yeast  on top of that.  Medium wheat cycle (20 minutes knead, 25 minutes first  rise, 50 minutes second rise, bake 55 minutes).   Add the raisins and  scotch after 12 minutes of kneading.  You may need to help the kneading  with a rubber spatula -- depends on your machine and the precise moisture  of your ingredients.  Dont expect much rise;  this bread is fine-textured.    >From: schapin@mitre.org (Susan Chapin)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
