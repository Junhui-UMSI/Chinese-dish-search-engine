Place the veggies in a large bowl. In a  separate container, mix remaining ingredients in order listed, mixing well.  Pour this mixture over the veggies, and cover with plastic wrap. Best if  allowed to sit for an hour or so before serving--even better if  refrigerated overnight and brought to room temperature before serving.
