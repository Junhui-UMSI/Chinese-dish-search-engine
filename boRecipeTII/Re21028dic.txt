It comes from "The Country  Cookbook" by Farm Journal.    Wash corn, add 2 qts. cold  water and soda; cover and soak overnight.  In  morning bring to boil (in enamel kettle) in the water in which corn soaked.  Cook three hours or until hulls loosen. Add more water if necessary.  Drain  off water; wash corn in cold water, rubbing vigorously until hulls are  removed. Bring corn to a boil in 2 qts. cold water, drain.  Repeat.  Add 1  t. salt. Makes about 3 quarts.    Washing the hulls from the corn is very time consuming. Also do NOT add the  salt until the hominy is finished. (I did once and it was a disaster!) The  two notes in my cookbook beside this recipe are "very good!" and "lots of  trouble".    Im not sure about the fat content, I realize that the corn itself does  contain some fat. Corine Netzers  Fat Counter lists canned hominy at .5 to  1 gram of fat per 1/2 cup for various brands. Sallie K.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #103    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
