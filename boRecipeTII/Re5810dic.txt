Pinto Beans
Pinto Beans, Salt, Garlic, Water, Cumin Seed, Bacon, Onion, Vegetable oil, 
Mix the water, beans, and onion in a 4-quart Dutch oven.  Cover and heat to  boiling.  Boil 2 minutes and remove from the heat; let stand for 1 hour.  Add just enough water to the beans to cover.  Stir in the remaining  ingredients and heat to boiling.  Cover and reduce the heat.  Boil gently,  stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, about 2 hours, (add  water during the cooking time if necessary); drain the beans.  Beans can be  covered and refrigerated up to 10 days.    Miscellaneous recipes from the collection of Mike Orchekowski.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mo-misc.zip
