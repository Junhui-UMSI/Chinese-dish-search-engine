In a large bowl, combine flours and salt. Add yeast mixture; stir til soft  dough forms. Place dough on lightly floured surface and knead in remaining  1/2 cup of flour until dough is elastic.    Spray large bowl with Pam and place dough in bowl. Turn dough several times  to coat top with the Pam from the bowl. Cover with towel or loose fitting  sheet of plastic. Let raise in warm place until dough is double in size.  Punch down gently, remove from bowl and start forming into shape of your  pizza pan with your hands or divide into 8 and start forming individual  pizza crusts.    Place pre-shaped dough on pan sprayed with Pam and sprinkled with the  cornmeal. Finish shaping dough with your hands pressing from the center of  the dough out to the edges.    After adding your favorite ingredients bake at 400F for 15-18 minutes -  ovens vary. If I put the ff moz. cheese on the top, I have to bake around  350F for 20 minutes + because the cheese browns too fast and gets hard in  the hotter oven.    Sometimes I add basil, thyme and oregano to the dough for added zip.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #93    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
