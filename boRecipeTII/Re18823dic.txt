Andhra Mutton Biriyani
Mutton, Garlic, Yogurt, Onions, Chiles, Ghee, Water, Turmeric, Basmati, Ginger, Cloves, Salt, Cinnamon, Cardomon seeds, 
Wash and soak the rice in water for 1/2 hour. Drain off the water and tie  the rice into a cloth. Add the meat to a mixture of the yogurt and 2 tsp  salt and set aside. Saute the chiles in 1 TBS ghee. Mix the chiles, ginger,  garlic, and half the cinnamon, cloves and cardamom together and grind into  a fine paste. Rub the ground spices into the meat. Heat half the remaining  ghee and add the meat and spice/yogurt mixture and half the onions and cook  over a low fire until the meat is tender. Heat the remaining ghee and add  the remaining cinnamon, cloves and cardamom. After they have cooked for a  few minutes add the rest of the onions and fry until they are golden brown.  Add the rice and fry it until it is slightly brown. At this point, add the  6 cups boiling water, and then the turmeric and remaining salt. Let the  rice mixture cook until the water is almost level with the grains (the rice  should be half done by then) and then add the meat and its gravy. Do not  mix them, but, after placing a tight lid on the pot, let the biriyani  simmer for 15-20 minutes. After this, mix well and serve. Serves 8. This is  almost a complete meal by itself, although pickles, chutneys and vegetables  dishes would probably be served with it. Heat scale: Hot.
