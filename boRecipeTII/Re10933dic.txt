Rub pieces of rabbit with garlic and then  coat with flour.  Brown pieces of rabbit in the oil until golden brown on  all sides.  Cover and simmer until rabbit is tender, about 1 to 1-1/2  hours.  Pour off excess fat.    TO PREPARE SAUCE, melt buttter in a large saucepan. Saute carrot, onion,  green pepper, and mushrooms. When vegetables are soft, stir in flour.  Gradually stir in chicken broth and orange juice. Cook over low heat,  stirring constantly, until sauce bubbles and thickens slightly. Add orange  peel, peanut butter, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, cloves, nutmeg, and salt  and pepper to taste.  Simmer sauce about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Place rabbit on a platter. Skim excess fat from top of sauce and spoon  sauce over rabbit pieces. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
