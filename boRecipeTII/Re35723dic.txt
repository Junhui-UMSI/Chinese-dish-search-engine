Stuffed Calamari with Peas, Sundried Tomatoes and Chilies
Sundried tomatoes, Basic tomato sauce, Virgin olive oil, Dry white wine, Fresh breadcrumbs, Italian parsley, Calamari, garlic, Fresh peas, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.    Clean the calamari. Remove the tentacles, finely chop them and set aside.  Remove insides, being careful not to cut the stomach. In a 12 to 14-inch  saute pan, heat oil until smoking. Add calamari tentacle pieces and cook  until opaque. Add peas, garlic and sundried tomatoes and stir through,  about 1 minute. Add bread crumbs and stir to coat. Season with salt and  pepper and add parsley. Allow mixture to cool. Stuff bread mixture into  each calamari until full and place in a 12 by 8-inch earthenware dish (just  large enough to hold calamari and sauce). Add wine and tomato sauce and  stir to settle. Place in oven and bake 35 minutes. Remove and serve.    Recipe by: Molto Mario MB1D13 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #603 by Sue  <suechef@sover.net> on May 09, 1997
