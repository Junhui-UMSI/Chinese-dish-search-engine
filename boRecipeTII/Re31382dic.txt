Barbados Hot Sauce
Onion, Salt, Green onions, Bonnet peppers, Horseradish, White vinegar, Mustard, powdered, Turmeric, Garlic, 
This recipe is from a fund raising cookbook from Barbados. Windmill doesnt  include horseradish in the list of ingredients but it sounds good.    Mince the first 8 ingredients together. Add vinegar until the desired  consistency is obtained, then bottle and leave for 3 or 4 days before  using.
