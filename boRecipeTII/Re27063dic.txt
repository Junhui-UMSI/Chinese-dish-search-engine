Heat the lard in a heavy bottomed pot (or ovenproof Pyrex casserole or the  like).  Lightly sear and mix together the meat cubes and the onions; season  with salt, an ample amount of pepper, and a very little bit of crushed  marjoram.  Remove two thirds of the meat and onions from the pot and set  aside.    Mix the potatoes and vegetables together; spread a third of these over the  bottom layer of meat cubes in the pot or casserole. Sprinkle with salt and  a little pepper. Alternate 2 more layers of meat with 2 more layers of  vegetables.  Each layer should be separately seasoned with salt and pepper;  the top layer MUST consist of vegetables and potatoes. Pour in the beef  stock. Cover tightly and cook over medium-low heat for just about 2 hours.  Cooking in a 350 degrees F oven is also possible. You should not stir the  stew, but you can tilt the pot back and forth to circulate the liquid and  prevent the bottom layer from burning. Serve sprinkled with chopped  parsley.    Variations:    Savoy cabbage is frequently added to the roster of vegetables, and it  tastes delicious.  Sliced kohlrabi would be fine as well.    For a truly gourmet Pichelsteiner, 6 to 8 slices of bone marrow should be  briefly sauteed with the onions at the beginning, then added to one of the  in-between layers of meat. Doubling of ingredients is advisable.  Pichelsteiner tastes excellent reheated.    Makes 4 servings.
