submitted by: ewebber@pioneer.net (Alecia Webber,  Albany, Oregon)  As the weather heats up, so does the need for some cool refreshment!! Home  made ice cream is the only way to go!!    Mix the above ingredients very well. Pour into an ice cream freezer (we  still use the hand cranked kind) If there is still room in the ice cream  container, fill almost to the top with whole milk. Be careful, though, as  the ice cream swells as it freezes. We usually serve this ice cream with a  freshly baked angel food cake and sliced strawberries. A perfect end to a  summer evening meal!
