Slice the potatoes into 1/8-to-1/4-inch-thick round. Then slice the rounds  again into matchstick-size pieces, 1/8-1/4-inch-wide and about 2-3 inches  long. Keep covered with cold water until ready to use.    Place the butter and oil in a large saute pan. Heat over medium heat, then  add the potatoes. Fry the potatoes until they begin to brown, about 4 min.  Add the onion and garlic and continue to fry until the potatoes begin to  soften, about 5 min more. Add the mushroom stems and continue to fry,  adding more oil if the mixture is too dry. When the mushrooms begin to go  limp, in about 3 min, add the paprika and salt to taste. Sprinkle parsley  on top and serve.
