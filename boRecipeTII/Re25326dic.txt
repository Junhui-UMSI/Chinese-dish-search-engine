Tortas
Cheese, Refried beans, Guacamole, Ham, Mexican rolls, 
I havent tried this yet, but it sounds yummy. I think I got the recipe  from a Mexican cooking show on TV.    Split rolls. Layer warmed refried beans, ham and cheese on bottom half of  roll. Broil until cheese melts. Spread top of roll generously with  guacamole. Put together for sandwich.    Variation: Substitute charcoal broiled or pan-fried steaks for ham and  cheese and add green chile strips, along with beans and guacamole.
