An easy to prepare and elegant finger food! Artichoke hearts are wrapped in  paper thin slices of prosciutto and then marinated in an orange-thyme  imbued olive oil. The salt-cured Italian ham complements the bland flavor  of the artichoke hearts. 1. Wrap each artichoke heart in a slice of  prosciutto and secure with a toothpick.    2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the olive oil, thyme, orange peel,  and pepper. Pour the dressing over the roll-ups and let marinate 1 to 2  hours or as much as overnight.    3. Serve at room temperature.    12 to 16 roll-ups    Source(including opening narrative): The Uncommon Gourmet by Ellen Helman
