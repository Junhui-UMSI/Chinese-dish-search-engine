Acrobat Chocolate Polenta Cake
Sugar, Cornmeal, Semi-sweet chocolate, Egg whites, Cream of tartar, All-purpose flour, Egg yolks, Sweet butter, Ground almonds, Brown sugar, 
In a large saucepan over very low heat, melt chocolate. Add butter, stir  until melted and remove from heat (the mixture should be body temperature,  not too hot to touch with a finger). In a large bowl, combine egg yolks,  brown and white sugar, and stir until well mixed. Add the chocolate, and  stir well until combined. In a small bowl, combine almonds, flour and  cornmeal, stir until well mixed. Pour this into the chocolate and stir  until combined. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites  with cream of tartar until they form stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into  the chocolate in three batches. Chef Dale Nichols warns that folding egg  whites into chocolate takes a real knack and suggests using your hand as  the paddle. To do this by hand, use your hand as a paddle and push your  palm down to the centre of the bowl, and slide up the side of the bowl and  turn your hand over. Do not over-mix or you will knock the air out of the  egg whites causing a much denser texture. Bake in a buttered, floured 10  inch spring form pan for 5 minutes at 400F. Reduce heat to 350F and bake  for another 20 to 30 minutes, or until cake tests done in the centre. Let  cool completely before removing from pan.
