Yerushalmi Kugel
Salt and pepper, Vegetable oil, Eggs, Thin noodles, Sugar, 
http://www.virtual.co.il/city_services/kitchen Recipies from Virtual  Jerusalem W Here are some recipies I found at the above address in Israel.  These are the two I selected but there are several more.    Cook noodles, rinse and drain. Dont overcook the noodles, they will get  too soft and wont mix well with the other ingredients.    In a separate pot, combine oil and sugar and cook on medium-low heat. Stir  until sugar is liquid and brown, about 3-5 minutes. Be very careful when  you brown the sugar. Many a pot has been hopelessly lost in this process.  As youre browning the sugar it can turn from golden-brown to inky-black in  seconds.    Add noodles slowly, mixing continuously, on low heat until brown.    Let cool, add eggs, salt and pepper. Mix well.    Pour into preheated oiled pan at 350 degrees (thats about 175 on  European/Israeli ovens).    Bake for 1 hour, until top forms crust.
