Select watermelon with thick rind. Eat watermelon. Save rinds. Remove outer  skin and pink flesh from rind. Use only greenish-white part of rind; cut  into strips or 1-inch cubes. Combine water and lime; add rind and soak  overnight in refrigerator. Drain and rinse in cold water. Add fresh water  and boil 30 minutes. Drain. Combine vinegar, sugar and spices. Pour over  rind. Boil slowly until cubes look clear (about 1 hour) being sure cubes  are covered with syrup throughout cooking. Add water if syrup cooks down.  Pack pickles in hot, sterile jars; cover with syrup and seal. Makes about 8  pints.    NOTE:  Get a book on canning if unsure about sealing and processing.
