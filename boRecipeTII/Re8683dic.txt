From: Jane Sales <Jane.Sales@isltd.insignia.com>    Date: Fri, 14 Jan 94 09:29:09 GMT  This recipe is from a local womens groups Potteries Cookbook. Homemade  oatcakes never seemed as good as the shop-bought thing, strangely, but this  is the best recipe Ive found.    Mix the flour, oatmeal, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make  a well in the centre and pour in the beaten eggs and milk. Mix with a  wooden spoon, gardually incorporating more of the flour until the mixture  forms a smooth batter. Set aside for 30 minutes.    Use hot frying pan or griddle, and grease it with melted butter. Place 3 or  4 tablespoons of mixture on it, well-spaced, and cook for 1 minute.    The traditional way to serves them seems to be with butter and jam, but our  family always perferred them as a savoury dish, with melted cheese and  eggs.
