Tagliatelle, Asparagus, and Peas with Saffron Cream
Saffron threads, lemon peel, Pepper, Fresh pasta, Shallots, Salt, Asparagus, Butter, English peas, Heavy cream, Chervil, Parmesan cheese, 
Bring a large pot of water to boil. Snap off the tough ends of the  asparagus and set them aside to use in a soup stock, or discard them. Cut  off the tips, leaving them about 2 inches long, and slice the remaining  pieces on the diagonal or into short rounds. Shell the peas. Cover the  saffron with a couple of tablespoons of boiling water, to make an infusion.  Melt the butter in a wide saute pan, and gently cook the shallots for  several minutes, or until they are soft. Add the cream and the saffron  infusion, bring to a boil, reduce slightly, and season with salt. When the  pasta water is boiling, add salt, and cook the asparagus, and then the  peas, in the boiling water. Scoop them out when they are done and add them  to the cream. Next cook the pasta; when it is done, add it to the cream,  turning it over several times with a pair of tongs to coat it with the  sauce. Add the chervil leaves and the lemon peel, and serve on warm plates  with grated Parmesan and freshly ground pepper.    NOTES : The peas are small and fresh, the asparagus, pencil thin.  The  fragrant saffron-flavored cream makes this pasta filling and substantial.  This is a rather special dish, fine for a company dinner.
