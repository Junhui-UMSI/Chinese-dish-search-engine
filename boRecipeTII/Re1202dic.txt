Crispy Potato Veggies
Broccoli, Instant mashed potato flakes, Grated Parmesan cheese, Garlic powder, Dried basil, Egg whites; *, 
* original was 1 whole egg    NOTE: The original recipe calls for 2 tblsp melted butter to be mixed with  the dry ingredients. Ive made other "oven-fried" veggies successfully  without adding oil to the dry mix, so I dont think its necessary here.    Preheat oven to 400F.    Mix the potato flakes, cheese, garlic powder and basil.    Beat the egg whites. Dip veggies in the egg and then into the potato and  cheese mixture, turning to coat. Bake for 10-12 minutes until lightly  brown.
