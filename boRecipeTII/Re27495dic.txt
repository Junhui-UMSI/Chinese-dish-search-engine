On each of 4 long metal skewers alternately thread chicken, onion and  peppers. Place on broiler pan. Coat kabobs evenly with cooking spray. Set  temperature control at Broil and arrange rack so kabobs are about 8 inches  from heat. Broil 8 minutes; turn over and broil, brushing liberally with  sauce until kabobs begin to glaze. To serve, place skewers on a bed of Thai  Rice Pilaf. Garnish with cilantro and lime slices.    Makes 4 servings.
