Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and heat  until the shortening is melted. Cool to lukewarm.    2. Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk mix.  Sift in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs and 2 cups flour. Beat  briskly until well blended. Add the remaining 2-1/2 cups flour and beat  until smooth. Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1 hour.    3. Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto it. This  dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent sticking, but  is easy to handle. Pat the dough into a round about 1/2 inch thick. Use a  3-inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts, placing them (and the  doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1 inch apart. These dont spread  much; they rise. Preheat oven to 450F. Let the doughnuts rest and rise for  20 minutes uncovered. Bake about 10 minutes or a little longer, until they  have a touch of golden brown. Remove from the oven. Have ready the melted  butter and a brush. On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar.  Brush each doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon  sugar. Serve hot.
