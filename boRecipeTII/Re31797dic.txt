Peel garlic and ginger.  Smash garlic.  Trim scallions and cut into 2"  lengths (dont be fancy, the next step is a food processor). Place garlic,  ginger, and scallions into a food processor and process until finely  chopped.  Remove to a 14x11x2" dish.  Add oil and pepper flakes. Cook in  microwave, uncovered, at 100% for 3 minutes. Remove from microwave and stir  in remaining ingredients, tossing gently to coat green beans. Cook,  uncovered, at 100% for 10-15 minutes, stirring 4-5 times. Serve hot or  cold.
