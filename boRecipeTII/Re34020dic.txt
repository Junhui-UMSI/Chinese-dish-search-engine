Basils Garlic Mayonnaise
Salt, Egg yolks, Whole garlic bulb, Vegetable oil, White pepper, Dijon mustard, Olive oil and honey to coat, Red wine vinegar, 
Serve with Basils Crab Cakes, Louisiana-Style.    1. Cut off about 1/2-inch of the top of the garlic bulb (the tips of the  cloves will be barely visible) and peel off the excess outer papery skin.  Rub bulb with a little olive oil and honey to keep it from drying out.  Place bulb, top side down, on a cookie sheet.    2. Bake in a preheated 375-degree oven until soft, about 20 minutes.    3. When cool, scoop out garlic into a food processor. Add egg yolks,  vinegar and mustard; process for 3 minutes. With machine running, slowly  add oil and process until mixture thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes.    4. Season with salt and white pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.
