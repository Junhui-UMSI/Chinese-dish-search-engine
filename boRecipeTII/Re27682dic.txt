Discard parsley  sprigs and bay leaf. Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley or dill. Prepare  your favorite dumplings; add them to soup about 15 minutes before serving.  NOTE from Jolie: The popularity of Goulash in the Hungarian home is well  known. By the addition of more meat cubes this hearty Goulash Soup may be  served as a main dish. You may vary the flavor by adding favorite  seasonings. Gutes aus Ungarn means Something Good from Hungary and Scharf  means HOT (as in spicy). I have a Hungarian Goulash Soup recipe for you by  Jolie Gabor (yes, the Gabor sisters mother) <G> I havent personally tried  this recipe, but am posting it here for your perusal... Enjoy!
