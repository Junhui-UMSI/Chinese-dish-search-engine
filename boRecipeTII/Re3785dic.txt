Drain, seed and chop the tomatoes.  Melt butter with oil in heavy large  saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5  minutes. Add tomatoes and cook until almost no liquid remains in pan,  stirring frequently, about 25 minutes.  Add cream, vodka and red pepper and  boil until thickened to sauce consistency, about 25 minutes. Season to  taste with salt and pepper. (Sauce can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and  refrigerate.) Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just  tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well. Transfer  to a large bowl.  Bring sauce to a simmer. Pour over pasta and toss well.  Sprinkle with Parmesan and chives and serve.    From the MM database of Judi M. Phelps. jphelps@shell.portal.com,  juphelps@delphi.com, or jphelps@best.com
