Quick Cauliflower Curry
Onion, garlic, Basic curry powder, cauliflower, Veg. stock, Nonfat plain yogurt, 
Saute onion and garlic in a little stock.  Add spices, cauliflower, and  stock, bring to a boil, and simmer about 10 mins., or until cauliflower is  tender but not mushy.  Remove from heat and add yogurt.  Serve with rice or  good bread to soak up the yummy sauce.  This recipe is adapted from "Basic Curry Sauce" in the Gradual Vegetarian  by Lisa Tracy. Cauliflower works well because it stays firm. I bought a  bottle of curry seasoning a few years ago and didnt like the mixture. Now  I just buy individual spices, so I can leave out things like cloves, which  I really dont care for. My basic curry powder is mostly cumin and  coriander, with a little ginger, cardamom, and cayenne.  Date: Mon, 27 May 1996 14:09:17 -0400 (EDT)    From: Margaret Marcum <marcum@acpub.duke.edu>  .
