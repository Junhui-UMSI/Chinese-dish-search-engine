:          "Cook Forever" BBQ Spareribs (or Chicken)                        Barb (Granny) Beck     These ribs are cooked very slowly for 6 to 8 hours and then if desired  "finished" on the BBQ.  I have tried shortcutting the recipe and boiling  the ribs. Both times my family complained about the ribs being "fatty".     Put ribs in oven and cook slowly (250 degrees) until they brown and start  to dry out.  This should take 2 to 3 hours.  Pour off the accumulated fat  and bursh on both sides with the sauce. Continue cooking another 4 to 6  hours, brushing on more sauce from time to time. If the ribs start to dry  out too much turn down the heat and/or cover with foil. If the sauce starts  to burn on the bottom of the pan the oven is too hot. When done they are  very tender. They are excellent straight from the oven and even better  heated or reheated on the BBQ. This recipe also works with chicken but cut  the cooking time in half. The whole idea is to cook the ribs slowly enough  to make them moist and tender and not to leave a burned mass of sauce in  the bottom of the pan which is really difficult to clean.
