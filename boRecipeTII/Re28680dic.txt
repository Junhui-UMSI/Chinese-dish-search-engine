Last, add melted butter, beer and Lonesome Red Bloody Mary Mix.  Sprinkle batter very thin on a hot greased skillet, turn with spatula. This  is a nice crisp, spicy pancake. The beer makes them tender.    EAT-L Digest  8 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
