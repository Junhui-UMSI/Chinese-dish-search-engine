The Cook & Kitchen Staff are offering you four different Thanksgiving Day  Dinner menus during November. Weve just begun our final recipe collection,  which features a "Thanksgiving Day Dinner on the Farm" menu.    Cornbread has been served at many a holiday dinner table since the first  celebration of thanks began. Its the perfect partner for soaking up all  that delicious pan gravy youve diligently prepared from yesterdays  recipe.    Preheat oven to 435-F degrees. Lightly grease a 9-inch by 13-inch inch  baking pan with vegetable oil spray. Using a sharp knife, remove corn  kernels from the ears (or simply thaw the frozen corn). Set aside.    In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix the all-purpose flour, cornmeal, baking  powder, and salt.    In a small bowl, combine the corn, milk, melted butter, egg, and honey, and  beat well to mix.    Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with the flour and cornmeal. Quickly and  thoroughly mix together.    Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, scraping any batter off the  sides of the bowl into the pan. Spread the batter evenly with a spatula.    Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cornbread is lightly browned and a  knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cut into 1 3/4-inch squares  and serve at once.    Kitchen Staff Tip: You can prepare todays recipe several days in advance  and warm through in your 325-F degrees turkey-roasting oven for about 10 or  15 minutes prior to serving; or just let it rest, covered with foil, on the  stove top while baking your turkey.
