Tuna Steak Marinade
Hot sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, Stuart Talkofsky, Butter, Lemon juice, Garlic, 
Grill or Broil basting with remaining marinade. Cook fish 4 - 6 minutes on  each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.    I cooked this on a stove top grill constantly basting. If cooked too long  it becomes too dry.    Meal Mastered by Stuart Talkofsky from a bag of tuna steaks.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #143 by stut@liii.com (Stu) on May 23, 1997
