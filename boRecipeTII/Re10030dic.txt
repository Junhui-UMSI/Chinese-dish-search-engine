In a 3-quart saucepan, place onion, water and sage and bring to a boil.  Thread one quail, followed by one piece of pancetta, followed by one quail  on each of four skewers and place on hottest part of grill. Cook 4 to 5  minutes on each side, until just pink at the leg bones. Meanwhile, pour  polenta slowly in a thin stream into boiling water, until all is  incorporated and polenta thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes.
