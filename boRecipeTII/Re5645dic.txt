Pineapple Tea
Unsweetened pineapple juice, Pineapple chunks, Garnish: fresh mint sprigs, Boiling water, Maraschino cherries, Lemon juice, Water, Unsweetened instant tea, Sugar, 
Combine tea and sugar; add 4 cups boiling water, stirring to dissolve. Add  pineapple juice, 3 cups water, and lemon juice; chill.    Pour 1/4 inch water into each section of two ice cube trays, and freeze  until firm. Place a cherry in the center of each cube in one tray; repeat  procedure with pineapple chunks in other tray. Pour 1/4 inch water into  each section over fruit, and freeze until firm. Fill sections with  additional water, and freeze until firm. (Freezing in stages prevents fruit  from floating to top of ice cube.) Serve tea over fruited ice cubes, and  garnish, if desired. Yield 17 cups.
