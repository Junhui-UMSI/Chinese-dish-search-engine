Vadalia Onion Relish
Celery seed, Dried mustard powder, Vadalia onions, Mustard seed, cabbage, Brown sugar, Salt, Turmeric, Flour, Cider vinegar, 
Combine chopped onions and shredded cabbage in a large glass or crockery  bowl - not metal. Dissolve salt in one quart of water and pour over the  vegetables, mixing well. Cover and let soak overnight.    In the morning, turn the vegetables into a large colander and drain. In a  large pot, dissolve the brown sugar in cider vinegar. Mix mustard and  turmeric with 1/2 water, then add the flour, mixing well to make a thick  paste with no lump. Add this to the vinegar and brown sugar mixture and  stir to blend, again making sure there are no lumps.    Add celery and mustard seeds and bring it all to a oil over medium heat,  stirring to keep it from sticking. The mixture will thicken as it comes to  a boil. When it does boil, add cabbage and onions and continue to boil and  stir for five minutes. (This mixture is very pungent and will clear your  head in nothing flat while you stir) Put in sterilized jars, top with  sterilized lids, and process in hot water bath for 15 minutes to seal.    Makes 1 1/2 quarts.
