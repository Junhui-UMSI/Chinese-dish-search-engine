Quick and Easy Popovers
Eggs, milk, Salt, Unsalted butter, All purpose flour, 
Butter 12 standard size muffin cups or a popover pan. In a bowl combine  eggs and salt. Using a whisk, beat lightly. Stir in milk and butter and  beat in the flour just until blended. Do no overbeat. Fill each cup about  half full and place in cold oven. Set temperature to 425 degrees and bake  for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees and bake until golden, about 15  minutes longer. They should be crisp on the outside. Quickly pierce each  popover with a thin metal skewer to release steam. Leave in the oven a  couple of minutes for further crisping. Remove and serve at once. Makes 12.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 02 Feb 97 by Cheryl Mainard <cmainard@ARTIC.EDU> on  Feb 3, 1997.
