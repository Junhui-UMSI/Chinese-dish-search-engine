Carnitas Tamale
Carnitas, Masa harina, chicken stock, Butter, Baking Powder, Salt, anise seeds, Cayenne pepper, Paprika, corn husks, Manchamantel Sauce, 
This is my favorite tamales recipe as the marriage of pork and the fruit in  the sauce w/chiles is very nice.    Makes: 12 to 18 tamales    Make the Carnitas - shredding meat by hand. Mix the masa harina and stock  with whisk In a large bowl , whisk (I use my kitchen Aid Mixer) the butter,  baking powder, salt, anise, cayenne, and paprika until very light and  fluffy. Blend in the masa in 1/4 cup scoops and continue beating after  each. You want this to be very fluffy and light. Test by taking a tsp. full  and dropping into a glass of water. If it floats-youve got it. If it  plunks to the bottom -- keep on beating!!!!!!!!    Divide the masa and Carnitas filling evenly between the corn husks, roll  and tie tamales. Then steam for 30 minutes.    Serve w/Manchamantel sauce    I try to find the extra large clean and nice looking corn husks and I split  a couple of not so perfect ones to use for "strings" to tie    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Shantihhh@aol.com on Dec 4, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
