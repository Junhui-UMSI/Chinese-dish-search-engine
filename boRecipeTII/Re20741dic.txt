Apple Dessert Pizza
Cornmeal, Apricot preserves;, Vegetable oil cooking spray, Sugar, Orange liqueur, pizza dough, Golden delicious apples, Ground cinnamon, 
Preheat oven to 375F. Spray a 14-in.-round pizza pan or large baking sheet  with oil and sprinkle with cornmeal.    Roll out pizza dough to a 14-in. circle on a lightly floured surface with a  lightly floured rolling pin. Transfer to the prepared pan.    Cut apples into thin slices (1/4 in. to 1/2 in.). Starting at the outer  edge and working toward the center, arrange the slices on pizza dough,  overlapping slightly in smaller and smaller circles until the surface is  covered. The apple layer should be at least as thick as the crust.    Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture evenly over  apples and bake about 30 minutes, or until crust is golden brown.    Meanwhile, combine preserves and liqueur in a small saucepan and cook over  low heat, until preserves dissolve.    To serve, remove the pizza from the oven, brush with warm apricot glaze and  cut into wedges.
