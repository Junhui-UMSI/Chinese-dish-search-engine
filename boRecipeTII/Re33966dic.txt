Sweet Chile Rellenos
Salt, Cinnamon, Pinon nuts, Eggs, Lean beef, Flour, Allspice, Brown sugar, green chile, 
Cook beef and grind fine.  Mix all ingredients except flour and eggs and  refrigerate overnight.  Divide mixture into walnut sized balls, rolling  them in flour as if making croquettes. Chill at least 2 hours. Beat egg  whites until stiff, then add yolks. Roll each ball in egg mixture and then  fry in saturated oil. Handle rellanos carefully, so the crust is not  punctured.  Place on paper towl to dry. WALT New Mexico Magazine Sept-93  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #308    Date: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 11:45:04 -0500    From: Walt Gray <waltgray@mnsinc.com>
