Just a variant note -- shredded carrot can be used in addition to, or even  in place of, the cabbage; also, raspberry vinegar (tres yuppie, i know) can  replace the cider vinegar + honey. If its still not sweet enough for your  taste you can add some fruit juice; peach works well. Oh, you can leave out  the oil too, esp if you add the fruit juice (dont want too much liquid in  there).    Formatted by Sue Smith, S.Smith34, TXFT40A@Prodigy.com using MMCONV.
