Every state has its own style of cooking chicken. This dish, which is  cooked in a fragrant cream sauce, is popular in Maharashtra, Bombay.    Combine cumin, cloves, pepper corns, cinnamon and cardamom seeds in an  electric coffee mill and grind until reduced to a powder. Set aside.    Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic and  ginger. Cook until onion is lightly browned, about 4 minutes,    Add ground spice mixture and cook until fragrant, about I minute. Add  tomato and chicken. Cook, stirring, until chicken pieces are no longer  pink.    Add yogurt and turn chicken pieces to coat. Add water, cayenne and salt.    Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook for 20 minutes.    Stir in half-and-half; simmer until chicken is tender and sauce is thick,  about 10 minutes.    Skim off excess fat.    Arrange chicken on a heated, deep serving dish and pour sauce over.    Garnish with cilantro.    Surround with onions, peppers and lemon wedges.
