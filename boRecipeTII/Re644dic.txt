Gingerbread House Frosting
Egg whites, Vanilla, Cream of tartar, Powdered sugar, 
Mix, beat for 7-10 minutes.  Spread as desired.    HOUSE HINTS:    Dont cut shapes until after doughs baked. Fill baking sheet with sheet of  dough, cut it as soon as out of oven. The shapes fit together better as  will become misshapen if cut before baking.    Bevel or miter edges of walls where they join. Do this with sandpaper after  the baked pieces have become cold. They fit better.    Forget trying to make the whole thing edible and use glue gun to stick  walls together. Only eat the flat part of the walls.    Can make roof out of 2 pieces of cardboard and cover with candy or shredded  wheat (thatched roof look). A gingerbread roof is heavy and difficult to  make even.    Make lots of soft royal icing and spread on liberally to look like snow and  cover small faults.    Use cardboard tube and stick bridge mix on it with royal icing. Looks like  a fieldstone chimney. Eat candy but not tube.    Ice cream cones covered with green and white icing make good evergreen  trees and pretzels are good for fences.
