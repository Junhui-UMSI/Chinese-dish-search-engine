This relish is often confused with the simple cucumber pickle, a jad.    Boil the vinegar, water and sugar to form a thin syrup.    Cut the cucumber in four lengthwise, and cut the pieces into segments about  an eighth of an inch thick.    Combine the vegetables in a small bowl, pour the syrup over them, and taste  for balance.    This will keep for about 3 weeks in the refrigerator.    To serve, pour into a small bowl and garnish with bai chi. Note that Thais  usually add drained prik dong (pickled chilis) to the bowl to their own  personal taste.    This is an accompaniment to sate, fish cakes and similar snacks and  starters.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #144    Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 12:25:49 -0700    From: "Colonel I.F.K.
