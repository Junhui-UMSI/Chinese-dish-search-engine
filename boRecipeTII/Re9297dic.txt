I dont know if the following is authentic Puerto Rican red beans and rice  recipe as it didnt come from an ethnic or regional cookbook, but I can say  that it is very good, from a book about rice, and different from a Southern  red beans and rice recipe.     Most red bean and rice recipes cook the vegetables with the beans for an  extended time.  This recipe stir-fries the vegetables for a crunchy texture  that I think is good.     This is a Puerto Rican style red bean and rice dish.  Basically you mix  some crunchy vegetables into some rice (see recipe for "Rice and  Vegetables"), serve some well flavored beans over the rice, and then some  more of the vegetables on top of the beans. Its also very good if you make  yellow rice with 1/4 tsp turmeric.     First you make the beans.  Bay leaf and cinnamon flavoring give them a  great taste:     Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan.  Add the onions and saute,  stirring, until coated with oil.  Cover and cook over very low heat,  stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 15-minutes. Stir in the  garlic and saute, uncovered for 3-minutes.     Add the beans and the broth to the onion.  Heat to boiling and cook,  covered, over low heat for 2 hours.  Add the bay leaves and cinnamon. Cover  and continue to cook until the beans are very tender, about 1 hour more.  Season with salt and hot red pepper sauce.  The beans can be prepared up to  24-hours before serving.  Reheat adding additonal broth if necessary.    HOWARD_W@HOLONET.NET    ("HOWARD E.
