Basil Chicken Salad
Celery, Black Pepper, Cooked; cubed skinless, Chopped scallion or chives, Sour cream, Fresh basil; chopped, Salt, 
This is one of my favourite luncheon meals. I serve it on a bed of fresh  spinach leaves, garnished with orange slices. The recipe originally called  for low/non fat sour cream, but I found that the sour cream tends to go  runny if its left for several hours so I tried a combination of half  nonfat/half fullfat. That seems to work well. Of course, for those of you  not calorie concious, you could use all full fat sour cream! :) This does  taste better if its refrigerated at least 3-4 hours before serving but  overnight is even better.    In a large bowl combine the chicken, celery, chives, sour cream and basil;  mix lightly with a fork.    Just before serving, add pepper and salt to taste.
