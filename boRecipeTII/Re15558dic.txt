Set aside.    layer: Lettuce, celery, onions, peas, miracle whip/milk mixture, cheese,  bacon pieces.    Refrigerate overnight.  You can vary the quantities of all the ingredients  to suit you.  You could also add a layer of ripe olives or something.  The  only layers that need to be in order are the lettuce, salad dressing mix,  and topped with the cheese and bacon. The celery, onions, peas, etc.  doesnt really matter the order they are in. Ripe olives I would put on top  with the cheese and bacon layer.
