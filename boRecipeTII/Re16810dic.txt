All Purpose B&b Cleaner
Water to make one gallon, Dish detergent, Hosehold ammonia, 70% isopropyl alcohol, 
Use a spray bottle to clean.  Glass, counter tops, enamel, sinks, toilets  all come squeeky clean and disinfected.  I store in a used gallon  container. I run a B&B and find its great and saves me a lot of    time. NOTE: Poison, keep out of reach of children.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #158 by Peg Doolin <pegsean@together.net> on  Jun 07, 1997
