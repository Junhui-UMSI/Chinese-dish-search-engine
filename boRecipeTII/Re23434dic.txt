This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers. I use the carcass  to make the stock first. I throw in any vegetables I want to use up in the  fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot greens  which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too hard by accident. After  straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables I use the  following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways with Chicken" cookbook, which  I usually double.  I also use more broth and less turkey than they call  for, I really dont measure the ingredients, I just add what Ive got until  its as thick as I want it and the proportions look right.    In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid, chiles  and onion; whirl until smooth. Pour into a large pan, add broth and bring  to a boil over high heat. Add turkey, rice, corn, garlic and spices. Reduce  heat and simmer until heated through.    Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their recipe  calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn tortilla chips  sometimes. ~- Sandra Chaffin (fnsjc@aurora.alaska.edu)
