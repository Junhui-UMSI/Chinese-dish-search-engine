Place kettle over medium heat and  let water come to boil while you prepare pudding batter. Mold must have lid  or be snugly covered with foil while steaming (coffee can with plastic lid  will work). Place rack or Mason jar ring on bottom of kettle so that water  can circulate under mold while steaming. Grease the mold. In small bowl,  combine persimmon puree and baking soda. Set aside while mixing other  ingredients (persimmon mixture will become quite stiff). In mixing bowl,  cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, lemon juice and rum and beat well. Add  flour, cinnamon and salt and stir to blend. Add persimmon mixture and beat  until well mixed. Stir in nuts and raisins. Spoon batter into mold, cover  tightly and steam 2 hours. Remove mold from kettle and set aside 5 minutes.  Turn onto rack to cool completely or to cool just a little and serve warm.
