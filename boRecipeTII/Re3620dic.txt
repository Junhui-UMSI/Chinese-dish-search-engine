Baking soda, Granulated sugar, Unsalted butter, Brown Sugar, Peanuts; Shelled & Skinned,, Cashews; toasted (see Note), Water, 
Thoroughly butter an 8 x 12inch roasting pan and place it in the freezer  for 5 to 10 minutes. Combine the brown and granulated sugars and the water  in a heavy stainlesssteel saucepan over medium heat and, stirring  occasionally, cook until the sugars have dissolved and the mixture is  simmering. Increase the heat to high and, without stirring, simmer the  syrup until it reaches 300 degrees on a candy thermometer (hardcrack  stage). Remove from the heat and add the baking soda and the nuts, mixing  thoroughly to make sure they are evenly blended in. Pour the mixture onto  the buttered slab and allow to cool completely. Lift off and break the  brittle into bitesized pieces. The candy will keep in an airtight glass jar  for several weeks. Yield: about 40 pieces Note: To toast nuts, preheat the  oven to 350 degrees. Spread the mixed nuts on a cookie sheet and toast in  the oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.
