from <<Faye Levys International Jewish Cookbook>>    In these pancakes the delicate green of the zucchini shows through the  golden brown crust. The Sephardic style yogurt and mint topping is a  refreshing complement.    Mix yogurt with mint & garlic. Season to taste with salt & pepper. Set  aside at room temperature.    Combine zucchini, garlic, salt, pepper. Add egg & stir lightly. Stir in  flour.    Heat oil in deep, heavy skillet. For each pancake, drop 1 heaping spoon of  zucchini mixture into pan. Flatten slightly with back of spoon & fry over  medium heat about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Turn  very carefully & drain on paper towels. Stir mixture before frying each  batch. If all the oil is absorbed, add a little more. Serve hot, with  topping & garnished with mint sprigs.
