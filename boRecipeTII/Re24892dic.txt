Australian Pork with Port and Coffee Sauce
Water, Cornstarch, Sugar, Pork loin, boned, Strong coffee, Cream, Port, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Remove rind from pork and trim fat to make a 1 cm  layer. Roll and tie the meat. Weight pork and calculate cooking time, allow  25-30 mins. per 500 gr. Place meat in roasting pan. Roast pork for 30 mins.    Combine coffee, 1/4 c. cream, 1/4 c port & sugar, pour over pork. Continue  roasting pork for calculated cooking time, basting pork every 15 mins with  coffee mixture. This basting gives the outside a beautiful golden glaze &  helps to keep the meat moist.    Remove pork from oven when cooked. Keep covered in a warm place while  making the sauce.    Skim fat from the pan juices. Place juices in a small saucepan with water,  remaining 1/4 c cream, remaining port and cornstarch. Cook until thickened,  strain.    Slice pork thinly and place a tablespoon or two of sauce on each serving.  Remaining sauce should be available for guests to add more.
