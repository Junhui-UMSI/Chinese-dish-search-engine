Cut any fat from pork chops. Season with salt and pepper. Roll chops in  bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper. Fry chops in hot butter,  margarine or oil until brown on both sides. Add 1/2 cup of water and cook  over low heat, covered, 45 to 60 mins., or until tender. Meanwhile, combine  cherries, sugar, cinnamon, lemon rind and honey and bring to a boil. Lower  heat and cook 5 mins. Add a little water to thin, if desired. Stir in  Madeira and remove from stove. Serve over cooked chops.    NOTES: Russians are extremely fond of pork, which they prepare in  interesting       variations. On of their great hoiday treats is roast suckling pig       stuffed with kasha. Other typical pork dishes, such as this one, are       served with fruit sauces. Plums may be substi- tuted for the cherries,       if desired.
