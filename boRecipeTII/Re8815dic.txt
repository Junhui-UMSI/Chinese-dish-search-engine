From: prkenne@lims01.lerc.nasa.gov (CAROL SHARP)    Date: 18 Nov 1993 07:58 EST  Here are two of my familys favorite Christmas cookies:    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients  except pecans and glaze. Blend at medium speed to form s stiff dough. Drop  by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 13 minutes until  deep golden brown. Cool. Top each cookie with 1/2 tsp pecans. In small  saucepan, melt butter, stir in brown sugar and milk. Add powdered sugar;  blend to make a glazing consistency. Drizzle glase over pecans. Makes about        4    dozen cookies.
