Quick Apple Pie
Cinnamon to taste, Recipe for 2-crust pie shell, Salt, Raisins (up to 1), 
(from Whole Foods for the Whole Family)    Cut the apples (peel them if you want to - I did).  Put in bottom half of  shell.  Sprinkle salt, raisins and cinnamon on top.  Put top half of crust  on, cut air vents in it. Bake at 425F for 20 - 30 minutes (or until top of  pie is golden and apples are tender).    If you think youll miss the sugar, think again.  The salt helps bring out  the natural sweetness of the apples.    I made this last night, and even though I dont like cooked raisins, it  wasnt bad.  My family (those who can speak) raved about it.
