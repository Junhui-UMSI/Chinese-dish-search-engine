Braised Herbed Cucumbers
English cucumbers, Whipping cream, Fresh parsley or dill, Vinegar, Coarse salt, fresh dill, Butter, fresh chives, Shallots, White pepper, 
If using regular cucumbers, peel cucumbers, halve them lengthwise and, with  a small spoon, scoop out the seeds. (This is not necessary with English  cucumbers.)  cut into 1" x 1 1/4" pieces.  Sprinkle with salt and vinegar;  let stand for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature. Drain and pat dry.    Preheat oven to 375F.  Transfer cucumbers to a stove-to-oven dish; toss  with butter, dill, chives, shallots and white pepper. Bake for 20 minutes  or until barely tender. Remove from oven; add cream. Toss; cook over medium  heat for about 5 minutes or until cream is reduced and thickened. Sprinkle  with minced parsley for garnish.
