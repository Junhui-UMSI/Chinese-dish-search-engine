Potato Pie Ala "Georges At the Cove"
See Directions, 
Slice very thin, enough russet potatoes to fill a deep pie pan. (If you  dont own a great slicer, use a cheap potato peeler).   Layer the potatoes  in the pan, and sprinkle on olive oil after each layer. Id guess about  quarter of a cup in all. Bake in a 350 degree oven until ALMOST done! Take  out of oven and let cool a little. Now carefully slice into pie like wedges  and DEEP FRY in Canola Oil. Thats it. Of course you could add garlic or  shallots or whatever you liked, but this is how they do it. They end up  being wedges of hot crisp slices that are tender in the middle. Let us know  how you like them     Love, Louise Posted by RUBYdakoda    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
