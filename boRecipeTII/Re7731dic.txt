The applesauce in the recipe is NOT a low fat substitute.  However you may  eliminate it and substitute butter, margarine, or baby food plums-- or even  fresh plum or pear puree.  The applesauce or plums impart a nice highlight  to the flavor.  I only made the bread once, and used pureed    Japanese Satsuma plums in the recipe, as I have trees in my yard.  Bread  texture should not be affected by which ever you choose to use.  I also  loaded up on the port...to almost 1/4 cup.  But I am a port nut.    The recipe is for the bread machine.  In manual adaptation, be prepared to  add up to 1 1/2 cups of additional flour.  I would start with the amount  called for and increase flour in 1/4 cup increments, til proper dough  texture is achieved during kneading...    Also, you may omit the blue cheese with no ill side affects and make this a  TRUE PORT BREAD.  The sharper the blue cheese--the stronger the flavor of  the bread.  Loaf appearance will vary with the brand of cheese you use.  This is a medium height loaf...dense.  I found this to be a nice recipe.    It stated it made great croutons...and it did!  Pine nuts might also be an    option to play with.    **You need not use an expensive port...simply one with a good flavor.    Just a thought...slice thin for toast points for cheese or pate during wine  tasting....*:)  Or ham sandwiches, tailgate style.  Recommended to serve  warm, steamed with steak bbq.    For the Bread Machine:  *note conversion for rapid rise cycle or regular  (dry active yeast) bake cycles.    >From: Katie E Green <kgreen@u.washington.edu>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
