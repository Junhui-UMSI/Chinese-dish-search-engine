Vegan Nacho Cheeze
Flour, Seasoned salt, green chiles, Nutritional yeast, 
NOTE: I use canned--I store the remainder of the can in the fridge and use  it throughout the week. Again, you can adjust this according to taste.  Measure flour, nutritional yeast, and salt into small saucepan. Whisk in 1  1/2 cups of water. Cook over high heat whisking constantly. Bring to boil,  allowing it to boil about 30 seconds or until it thickens up. Remove from  heat and stir in green Tabasco and chiles. Eat while still warm. (I have  heard that it does not reheat well, but I dont know becuase I have never  had any leftover :-) )    To make the mustard version, omit the Tabasco and the chiles and add 1  tablespoon of mustard (Ive used several different kinds all with good  results) to the cheeze after removing it from the burner.
