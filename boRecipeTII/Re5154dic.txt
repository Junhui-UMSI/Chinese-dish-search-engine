Grind the meat with bread.  Add the onions which have been sauteed in the  drippings.  Season with salt and pepper.   To prepare dough, mix the egg with  the flour, add a dash of salt and as much water as needed to knead a smooth  loose dough.  Roll out as thinly as you can. Cut out 2 1/2 to 3 inch  squares.  Put a little of the stuffing on each square. Fold to form a  triangle, pinch the edges together.    Cook in a large kettle with boiling  salted water on high heat for 5 minutes. Remove with a colander spoon to a  warmed serving platter.   Add the bread crumbs to the butter and fry for a  few minutes on low heat. Pour over the pierogi.
