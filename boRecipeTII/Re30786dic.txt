Tangerine Liqueur
80 proof vodka, Dozen whole cloves, Dozen ripe tangerines, Water, Cinnamon, Sugar, 
Wash and peel tangerines.  Remove any large pieces of pith remaining on  inside of peel.  Section tangerines and then cut each section into two or  three pieces. Put tangerine pieces and peel in a jar with vodka, water,  cinnamon, and cloves. Add white sugar and shake vigorously until sugar is  dissolved. Cover.  Let mixture set for three weeks, then strain and let the  liqueur settle until clear. This usually takes a week or ten days.
