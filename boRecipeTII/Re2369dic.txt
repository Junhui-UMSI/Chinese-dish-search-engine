"Roast beef steamed in the clay pot is a different experience. The meat has  a delightful texture you cant find in beef cooked any other way. But one  word of caution: its going to take much less time to cook than you think.  Rely strictly on your meat thermometer. The size of both the pot and roast  will make a difference. If you like your beef rare, check the thermometer  after 40 minutes. You can omit the vegetables if you dont want a complete  dinner."    Presoak your largest clay pot, top and bottom, in water fifteen minutes.    Trim fat from beef and rub with salt and pepper. Place beef in pot and  insert meat thermometer. Add to pot all above ingredients, plus 1 teaspoon  salt and dash of pepper.    Place covered pot in cold oven. Set temperature to 480 degrees. For rare  beef, check meat thermometer after 40 minutes. For medium beef, check after  1 hour. For well-done beef--if you really want it that way--check after 90  minutes.    Remove pot from oven when meat thermometer is almost up to temperature.  (Dont wait until its right on the nose or it will be overdone.) Pour  liquid into saucepan, bring to boil and thicken with about 1/2 teaspoon  arrowroot.
