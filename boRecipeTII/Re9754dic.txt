These rolls are a decadent treat which just happen to be very low in fat so  you can really enjoy them.    Remove dough upon completion of cycle and roll into a rectangle on a  floured counter. Add only enough flour to prevent sticking. Mix all filling  ingredients together and spread evenly over dough.    Roll dough in a jelly-roll fashion wide end to wide end. Cut into 12 equal  pieces and place in greased muffin tins. Cover and let rise in a warm,  draft free location for 30-45 minutes.    Bake in a preheated 350 F. over for 20-30 min. or until golden brown.    >From the recipe files of Suzy.Q    Posted to MM-Recipes by Suzy <suzy@bestweb.net> on Jan 2, 1998, converted  to MC format by MC_Buster.
