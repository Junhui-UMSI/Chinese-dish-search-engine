Pickled Eggs in Pickled Beet Juice
Sugar, Vinegar, Allspice, Cinnamon, Cloves, Water, Beets, 
Select small, young beets.  Wash.  Leave 3 inches of tops on and roots.  Cook until skins slip easily (about 15 minutes).   Pack beets into jars within 1/2 inch of top.  Pour boiling liquid syrup  over beets to within 1/2 inch of top of jar. Process for 30 minutes in  boiling water bath.   After the beets have had time to "cure" (about 2 months), we then eat  about 1/2 of the beets out of a quart jar, drop hard- boiled eggs into the  pickled beet juice, and put into the refrigerator for about 2 weeks. By  then, the beet color will have penetrated into the whites of the eggs  nearly to the yolk area. Of course, a much simpler way would be simply to  buy a large jar of pickled beets, eat about 1/2, and drop in hard- boiled  eggs; then, refrigerate and leave for a couple of weeks until the beet  juice has penetrated.
