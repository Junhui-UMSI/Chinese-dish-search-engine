The almonds need not be blanched, just sliced fine. Sift flour and baking  powder together, then set aside. Cream the eggs and sugar thoroughly. Add  the extract and water and beat hard. Add the sliced nuts and flour, beating  lightly until thoroughly mixed. Pour the batter into a greased pan,  sprinkle sugar over the top and bake at 350 f until brown. Allow the cake  to cool in pan before cutting in slices. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook  Book - Fine Old Recipes, Culinary Arts Press, 1936.
