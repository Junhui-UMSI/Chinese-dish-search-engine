Toasted Dried Sea Laver - Keem Kui
Sheets Dried Compressed, Sesame oil, Salt, 
Tissue-thin sheets of dried and compressed sea laver (keem) are toasted  lightly until they turn bright green, then cut into small pieces to serve  as a side dish with main courses, rice or vegetables.    Throughout the waters surrounding Korea, Japan and Northern China, this  type of laver is harvested and processed to be put to many uses in cooking;  as a garnish, a vegetable, an edible food wrapper or as part of a mixed  condiment.    Brush the sea laver sheets on one side with the sesame oil, then sprinkle  lightly with salt.    Suspend over a gas flame or place under a hot broiler for about 8 seconds,  until the laver turns bright green; do not let it burn or catch fire.    Cool slightly, then cut into small squares and arrange on a serving plate.    From Asia The Beautiful Cookbook.  Typed by Syd Bigger.
