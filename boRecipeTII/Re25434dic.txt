Tortilla Rolls Ups
Butter or red lettuce leaves, Thin sliced deli meat;, Large Flour Tortillas, Cream cheese, 
Spread cream cheese over tortilla, you may add seasonings of choice to the  cream cheese if you like. Place thin meat a combo, or the same over cream  cheese.  Then the lettuce leaves. roll up like a jelly roll and slice in  bite size peices for appetisers and impress your guests. A nice filling  addition would be thin slices or mashed advocado too, or even some black  olives...why didnt I think of that before? <G> They make a good sandwich  change for lunches, esp. for kids. I know there is a fancy name for these,  but it escapes me at the moment.
