Chicken breast, Carrots, Frozen peas, Water, Yellow curry powder, Vegetable oil, Potatoes, Fish sauce, Fresh veggies, Sugar, Coconut milk, Salt, Red curry paste, Bay leaf, 
1A.  Pre-cook potatoes and carrots.  Dont cook them too done, since they  will simmer with the main dish later.    1.  Cut boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces.    2.  Wash and cut fresh vegetables into bite-size pieces.    3.  In a heavy saucepan on medium heat, heat the veg. oil, red curry paste,  and about one third of the coconut milk. Heat 5-10 minutes, stirring, until  it forms a thin gravy.    4.  Turn the heat to high, add the chicken, and cook until the chicken is  half cooked, maybe five minutes.    5.  Add the fish sauce, sugar, salt, and rest of the coconut milk, and mix  well.    6.  Stir in the curry powder, potatoes, carrots, and water/stock. If  desired, add 1/s bay leaf.  Let simmer just a minute or two.    7.  Add the fresh vegetables and the frozen peas, and let simmer for 3 to 5  minutes, until fresh veggies are just done.    8.  Serve (with jasmine rice...).
