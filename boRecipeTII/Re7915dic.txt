This is hardly a traditional (Texas) recipe for chili, but it turned out  pretty good.    First, make the pot likker. Wash and soak the collard greens, remove the  leaves from the stems, and put into a large pot. Add water, vinegar,  tabasco peppers, garlic cloves, onion, smoked pork jowl, and black pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for six to eight hours. Remove and  reserve collards for another meal; strain pot likker and reserve.    Now, add pinto beans and bay leaves to the pot likker, bring to a boil, and  simmer until beans are semi-soft. Cut smoked chuck roast into bite-sized  chunks and add to the pot. Fry up hamburger, drain fat, chop, and add to  the pot. In a small frying pan roast the cumin and mustard seeds, crush in  a mortar and pestle, and add to the chili. Add all other ingredients, bring  to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occassionally.  Remove from heat, and serve.
