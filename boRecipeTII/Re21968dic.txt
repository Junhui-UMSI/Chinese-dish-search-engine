Applesauce Cake in Jars
All purpose flour, Baking Powder, Salt, Baking soda, Ground cinnamon, Optional, Shortening, Sugar, Ground cloves, Water, Large eggs, Applesauce, Chopped walnuts;=, 
Sterilize 8 (12 oz. Ball Quilted Crystal 14400-81400) canning jars, lids  and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow to air- dry  and cool. Leave the lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use ..  Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them (use a pastry brush)  with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Bakers Secret); set aside.    Cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time,  until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water; set  aside. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking  soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves. Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce  mixture. Fold in the nuts.    Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full. Place jars onto a  cookie sheet or theyll fall over. Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for  35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into the center of each cake  comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven, one at a time (use HEAVY- DUTY  MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid, then a ring on top and screw down  tightly.    Place jars onto your counter top to cool. Youll know when the jars have  sealed, youll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound, test them  by pressing down on the lids once the jars have cooled--they shouldnt move  at all.    Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year. Ive  only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they dont last that long  around here. Theyre wonderful for last minute gifts, especially for single  friends. Contributed by Lynn in Chicago, IL.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #257 by SVQF34B@prodigy.com ( L M SMITH) on  Sep 27, 1997
