Apple Pudding #1
Lemon rind; grated, Applesauce, Powdered sugar, Eggs, Whipping cream, Butter, 
This is a quick and delicious bit of Virginia history. Jefferson planted  several varieties of apples and they can be seen in the daily cooking of  the plantation. We assume that this recipe came from the old original  Monticello cookbook.      Mix all of the above together well and put in a pie shell or a baking  dish. I prefer a small baking dish. Bake 35-40 minutes at 350? or until  set.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
