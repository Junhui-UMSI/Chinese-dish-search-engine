Strawberry Shortcake with Vanilla Whipped Cre
Fresh Lemon Juice, Vanilla Whipped Cream, All-purpose flour, Salt, unsalted butter, Heavy cream, Sugar, Strawberries, Baking Powder, Egg, 
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Place strawberries in a bowl; sprinkle with lemon  juice and 1/4 cup sugar. Let stand to release juices, about 1 hour.    Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar, flour, baking  powder and salt. Use a fork or two knives to cut in butter until mixture  resembles coarse meal.    Whisk together egg and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons cream. Slowly add this  mixture to dry ingredients; mix with a fork until dough just comes  together. Do not overmix.    Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; pat into a 6-inch square. Cut  four 21/2-inch rounds; place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Whisk  together egg yolk and remaining tablespoon cream; brush over tops of  biscuits. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool slightly on wire  racks, about       15    minutes.    Slice shortcakes open while warm. Divide strawberries and their juice among  bottom halves of shortcakes; top with large dollops of Vanilla Whipped  Cream and upper halves of shortcakes. Serves 4.
