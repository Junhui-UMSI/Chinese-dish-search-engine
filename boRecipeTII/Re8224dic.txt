Potato Kugel for Eight
(5 mL) salt, Potatoes, Onion, Eggs, (60 mL) cooking oil, divided, (2 1/2 mL) pepper, 
Heat 1 tablespoon ( 15 mL) of the oil in a 8 or 9-inch (2 or 2.5 litre)  baking dish in a 375 degree F (190 degrees C) oven. Chop onion in food  processor or by hand, then fry gently in the rest of the oil. If you plan  to use a food processor, peel potatoes and cut into 2-inch (5 cm) chunks;  place in water to cover, until ready to process, then drain very well and  process in three batches with an egg in each batch until finely-grated. If  you are planning to grate them by hand, simply peel and grate, then stir in  eggs. Add cooked onion, salt and pepper to either version of potato/egg  mixture. Pour into heated baking pan and bake one hour, or until nicely  browned.  Posted to rec.food.recipes by esther@rochgte.fidonet.org (Esther Vail) on  Mar 22, 95.
