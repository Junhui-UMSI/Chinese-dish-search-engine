Cloves (large) garlic;, Chicken wings; tips removed, Fresh Lemon Juice, Tamari sauce, Butter, Fresh ground pepper to taste, Dry Red Wine, Dry mustard, Brown sugar, 
Place chicken wings, disjointed, in large flat pan.  Combine other  ingredients and pour over chicken. Let stand for at least 1 hour or over  night.  Be sure all wings are well coated with marinade. Place pan in 350  oven and reduce heat to 250. Bake 4-5 hours, turning wings at regular  intervals.  If all marinade is not absorbed, pour off and dry wings out a  bit longer in oven (but not too much) before serving. Makes a great hors  doeuvre or main course despite being a bit messy to eat.    REQUIRES MARINATING AND LONG    COOKING TIME BUT IT IS SIMPLE.    From the <Micro Cookbook Collection of Contemporary Recipes>.  Downloaded  from G Internet, G Internet.
