In a lidded casserole dish, arrange ingredients (not including breadcrumbs)  in alternating thin layers,  with a little rosemary and pepper on every  other layer.  Prepare sauce by thoroughly blending the butter and flour.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in a saucepan and bring briefly to the  boil. Remove from heat and stir in butter/flour mixture until even  consistency is reached.  Pour sauce over ingredients in casserole and  spread breadcrumbs thickly over whole surface.  Cook in medium oven (GM5),  covered, for about 1 hour, then remove lid and allow another 10-15 minutes  to brown breadcrumbs    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.
