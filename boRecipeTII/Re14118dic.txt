White Christmas Fudge
Walnuts, chopped, Vanilla, Corn syrup, Light cream, Sugar, Candied pineapple, Pecan halves, Candied fruit, 
Grease a 8x8" pan with butter for the finished fudge. Lightly oil a large,  heavy-bottomed saucepan. In it, combine the sugar, corn syrup and cream.  Cook over low heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the  heat to moderate and heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Cook, without  stirring, until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage, 240F. Remove from  the heat. Beat immediately until it begins to lose its gloss and starts to  get stiff. Add the vanilla. Slowly stir in the nuts and fruit. Pack into  the prepared pan and chill. Cut into small squares when cool. This  delicious fudge will keep soft for weeks if stored in an air-tight  container in a cool place.
