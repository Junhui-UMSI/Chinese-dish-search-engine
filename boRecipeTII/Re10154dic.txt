Makes 12 main-dish servings Ice water Fresh chives for garnish About 1 1/2  hours before serving: 1. In a medium bowl, stir flour and salt; cut in  shortening to resemble coarse crumbs. Stir in 6 to 7 tablespoons ice water,  a tablespoon at a time, until pastry just holds together. 2. Roll  three-fourths of pastry into a rectangle 3 inches larger all around than  13x9-inch baking dish. Line baking dish with pastry; trim pastry edge,  leaving 1-inch overhang. Fold overhang under; firmly press edge onto rim.  3. Roll trimmings and remaining pastry 1/8-ich thick. With floured 1/2 inch  round canape cutter, cut out as many rounds as possible. Moisten edge of  pastry rim with water; place rounds on edge, overlapping slightly; press  with fingertips. Reroll trimmings and cut more rounds if necessary. 4. In  large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add  eggs, one at a time, until blended, scraping bowl with rubber spatula. Beat  in milk and next 5 ingredients. 5. Preheat oven to 375 F. Sprinkle shredded  cheeses evenly over bottom of pie crust; pout egg mixture over cheeses. If  you like, arrange fresh chives on top to make a pretty design. Bake 45  minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.
