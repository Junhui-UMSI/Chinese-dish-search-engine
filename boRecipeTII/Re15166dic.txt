Wheat-Free Scotty Biscuits
Melted butter or margarine, Sugar, Rye flour, Oatmeal, milk, 
Combine oatmeal, 3/4 cup of the rye flour, sugar and butter together.  Slowly add the milk till a firm but slightly sticky dough forms. Scrape out  dough onto a wooden board or counter. Knead in the rest of the rye flour  till the dough stiffens a little. Wrap in saran wrap and chill for one  hour.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough till 1/4 inch thickness. Cut  into shapes ( I like to use scotty dog cutters). Place on lightly greased  cookie sheets. Bake for 15 minutes. Turn off oven and let biscuits rest  till cool in oven with the door closed. Store in air-tight container for up  to 2 weeks.    Posted to Bread-bakers Digest by Marg aka MEMAW <maf@fn.net> on Mar 29,  1998
