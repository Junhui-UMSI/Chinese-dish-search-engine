Bellys Brisket Marinade
Soy sauce, Lousiana hot sauce, Dr Pepper, Lime juice, fresh, 
Heres Bellys famous Dr Pepper marinade. Several of us use it. Try to let  it work for at least 24 hours before cooking.    I sub worchestershire for soy and lemon for lime sometimes.    Sounds like you only got part of the whole brisket. Probably has very  little fat on it. You should either get some beef fat from the market or  else drape the meat you have with bacon to keep it from drying out. Also  use a spray of 50/50 oil and either Dr Pepper or lemon juice every hour or  so to keep the meat from drying out too much. Next time look for a whole  packer trimmed brisket. Weight should run from 7 to 15 lbs.with a good fat  cap. It will do better with the long cooking times for low and slow.    Posted to bbq-digest by Rodney <rlcz@netdoor.com> on Oct 07, 1998,
