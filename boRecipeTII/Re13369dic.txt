Yams with Ginger and Dried Apricots (r T)
Pc Fresh Ginger; 1/2" Piece,, Water, Yams; (12 - 16 Ozs), Dried Apricots; Cut In, 
Recipe by Deborah Madison    Apricots are quite delicious with yams. Leave the ginger in big pieces and  pull it out later, or finely chop it and leave it with the yams, as you  wish.    If the skin on the yam looks firm and smooth, scrub the yam. Otherwise,  peel it.    Cut the yam into rounds slightly less than 1/2" thick, and cut each round  into quarters, or sixths if it is very large. Combine all the ingredients  in a small saucepan, cover with 1 1/2 C water, bring to a boil, then  simmer, covered, for 1/2 hrs. Check the pan and add more water, in small  increments if necessary, until the yams are completely cooked, another 20  minutes or so. Allow whatever liquid is left to boil down until a small  amount of sauce is left. Pile into a bowl and serve.    Variation: Whip the yam-apricot mixture briefly in a food processor to make  a puree.
