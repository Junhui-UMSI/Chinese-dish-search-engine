In a medium saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and  saute until soft, but not browned. Mix in garlic and cumin; then add green  chiles, tomato sauce, stock, and water. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce  heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.    3. Meanwhile, bake fried tortilla strips in a single layer in a preheated  325 degree F oven 8 to 10 minutes. Place heatproof soup bowls on baking  sheet in oven during last 5 minutes.    4. Remove hot soup bowls to a heatproof tray. Working quickly, divide hot  tortilla strips among the bowls. Top with cheese cubes. Ladle hot soup over  tortillas and cheese and serve at once.    5. Spoon in a little sour cream at the table, if desired.
