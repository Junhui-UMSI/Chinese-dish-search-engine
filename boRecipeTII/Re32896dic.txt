Very lge. red peppers,>>>>, Coarse (kosher) salt, Sugar, Crushed OR>>>>>>>>>, White wine vinegar, Mustard seeds, slightly>>>>, Fennel seeds, Seeded & chopped (4 cups), 
Mix chopped red peppers and salt and let stand overnight in a ceramic,  stainless-steel or enameled container, refrigerated.    Drain off and discard the liquid and put the peppers into a stainless or  enameled pot with the vinegar, sugar and mustard (or fennel) seeds. Bring  to boil, then lower heat to med. and cook, stirring occasionally, until the  peppers are translucent and the relish is the consistency of marmalade, but  syrupy. (If relish begins to thicken too much before the peppers are  translucent, cover pot and lower heat for a few minutes while the peppers  complete the necessary cooking without too much evaporation.) Dont  overcook, or a too-stiff relish will result.    Prepare 4 half-pint canning jars with 2 pc. screw-on lids, and ladle relish  into each, leaving 1/2" headroom. Process in boiling water to cover jars by  2" for 10 minutes.    Remove jars and cool.  Ready for use immediately.
