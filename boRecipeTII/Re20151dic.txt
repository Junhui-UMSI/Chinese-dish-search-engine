Add flour and cook on low heat for 7 to  10 minutes or until a nutty aroma develops. Do not brown or color roux.  Remove remove heat and let cool.    In a seprate saucepan, heat half and half with sugar and bring to a boil.  Add roux and stir until thickened.  Reduce heat and continue cooking an  additional 5 minutes to prevent sauce from breaking.  Stir constantly.  Remove from heat once sauce has thickened and stir in vanilla.
