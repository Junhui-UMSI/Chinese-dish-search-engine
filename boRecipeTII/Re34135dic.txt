Rinse well; pat dry with paper towels. Beat the egg, milk, flour,  salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Dip each flower into the batter. Deep-fry  in oil that is hot but not smoking (350F - 375F), until golden brown. Drain  on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.    NOTES : Source: A Kitchen Witchs Cookbook.
