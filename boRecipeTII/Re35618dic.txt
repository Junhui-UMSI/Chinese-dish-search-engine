Structural Gingerbread
Ginger, Margarine, Salt, Light brown sugar, packed, Light corn syrup, Flour, Cinnamon, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir ingredients together in a large bowl.  Combine corn syrup, brown sugar and margarine in a 2 quart saucepan. Site  constantly over medium heat until margarine is melted. Stir the liquid into  the flour mixture. Mix well using hands until dough becomes stiff. Chill  the dough until its easy to handle. Roll dough out to a 1/8" thickness on  parchment paper. Use patterns to cut into shapes. Bake 12-15 minutes or  until golden brown. Check for air bubles during baking and poke them with a  sharp knife or toothpick. When baking is done, slide the parchment onto a  large cooling rack. Make sure all the pieces lie flat! Cool.    Note: Dark corn syrup and dark brown sugar may be used and will result in a  darker dough. Submitted By SQUEAKN@PCNET.COM (BARBARA MORGENROTH) On MON,       27    NOV 95 055224 EST
