Polvo Frito (Fried Octopus)
Text Only, 
A friend born in Portugal supplied this simple and excellent example  of Portuguese home-cooking.    Precook 1 kg of octopus, drain and cool.  Cut it up into generous  chunks. Beat 3 eggs, with a little milk salt and pepper to taste, and  half a bunch of very finely chopped parsley.  Coat the octopus pieces  in the egg mixture and shallow fry in a little olive oil, turning  them until they are golden.    Serve.    Makes 3 or 4 servings.
