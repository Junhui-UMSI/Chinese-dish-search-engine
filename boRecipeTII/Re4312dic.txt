Persian Sugar-Pickled Garlic
Black peppercorns, garlic, Water, Sugar, cloves, Red wine vinegar, 
Separate garlic cloves, but do not peel.  Place all ingredients in a large  heavy-bottom saucepan.  Bring to a boil; cook for 10 minutes, stirring from  time to time.  Reduce heat to moderate and cook 5 minutes. Cool to room  temperature.  Transfer to a large glass or ceramic jar large enough to hold  garlic and the liquid.  Tightly seal. Refrigerate at least 1 month before  serving.  The garlic improves with age for as long as 15 years.
