Pineapple Muffin Cookies
Baking soda, Salt, Flour, Shortening, Nutmeg, Sugar, Walnuts, chopped, Crushed pineapple with juice, Egg, 
A last minute substitute gave a new twist to an old Amish recipe for  raisin cookies. The cupboard was bare so leftover pineapple was substituted  for the raisins. Everyone preferred the pineapple version. (Editors Note:  We called these Pineapple Muffins Cookies, because they came out big and  soft.)     Preheat oven to 350?.     In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening, sugar and egg. When light and  fluffy, stir in crushed pineapple with juice.     Sift flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together and stir into batter.  When the mixture is well blended, stir in nuts.     Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350?  for 8-10 minutes. Cool on wire racks.    Yield: 5 dozen.
