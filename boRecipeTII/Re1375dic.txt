It was always  such a treat hot or cold. Mother would pack a few cold ones with our school  lunch or for camp. This is a little trouble to make, but it makes a  wonderful appetizer. Mother grate d the bell pepper flesh off the skin, I  prefer to nail it in the food processor, skin and all. Anyway, these  meatballs accompanied me on many adventures.
