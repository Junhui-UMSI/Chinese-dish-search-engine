Basil-Parmesan Scones
Parmesan, Basil, Powder, black pepper, Dash garlic & onion, Recipe buttermilk bisquits, 
Theres a bakery near me called Aunt Marys (are you listening, Sallie?)  and they have the most wonderful basil-parmesan scones. One day I  experimented and was pleased to find a pretty good facsimile.    Just add the above ingredients along with all the other dry ingredients and  proceed as above.  These are a nice change of pace from Italian or garlic  bread. Or cut with smaller cutter and serve as appetizer (dont forget to  reduce baking time if smaller).
