Pour the boiling water over the salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar and shortening.  When it is lukewarm, add the yeast which has been dissolved in the 2  tablespoons of lukewarm water. Add the egg and 1 1/2 cups of the flour. Let  this batter rise at 85F until double in bulk, then add the remaining flour.  Knead until smooth. Let rise again for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 14  parts.  Roll out each part until 1/2" thick. Peel, core, and cut apples in  half.  Place a half, cut side up, on each piece of dough. Combine the  remaining ingredients and fill the cores with the mixture. Press the dough  firmly together over the apples and invert on a dull, greased, cookie tin.  Brush with melted shortening, and sprinkle with a little sugar and ground  cinnamon.  Let rise for 1 hour. Bake at 350F for 40 minutes, until a rich  brown.  Serve hot.  Allow 1 or 2 for each portion.
