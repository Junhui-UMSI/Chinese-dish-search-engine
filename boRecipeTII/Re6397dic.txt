Plum Butter - Martha Stewart Living
Sugar, Ground cinnamon, Ground cardamom, Plums, 
1. Split plums in half, remove pits, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Do not  peel. Place in a 6-quart nonreactive saucepan and add 1 C water and the  sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until fruit is very soft,  about 20 minutes. Remove from heat; puree fruit and liquid in a food mill  or food processor.    2. Rinse saucepan and return puree to pan along with cardamom and cinnamon.  Cook over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, until thick  enough to spread, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from heat and let cool. Store in  an airtight container. The butter will keep for up to 1 month in the  refrigerator, 6 months in the freezer.
