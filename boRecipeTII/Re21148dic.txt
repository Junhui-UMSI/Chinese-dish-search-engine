Two-Squash Gratin with Caramelized Onions
Low-Sodium Chicken Stock;, Chopped Fresh Thyme, Sugar, Fresh Bread Crumbs; Lightly, Acorn Squash, Grated Parmesan, Orange-Flesh Winter Squash;, Salt, Unsalted butter, Onion; Peeled And Sliced, Chopped Fresh Marjoram, 
Heat oven to 400 degrees with rack in center. Peel the squash with a  vegetable peeler. Halve the squash lengthwise, and remove the seeds and  pulp. Cut crosswise into 1/4" slices, and set aside.    Spray a 10" skillet with cooking spray. Add butter, and melt over medium  heat. Working in batches, add whole rounds of onion. Cover, and cook over  medium-low heat, 12 - 15 minutes; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and sugar. Do  not turn onion rounds over. Continue to cook, covered, on same side, until  onions are golden and caramelized, 5 - 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and  set aside in pan.    Spray an 11-by-7 inch oval gratin dish with cooking spray. Layer the squash  slices along the bottom of the dish, alternating the two colors. Sprinkle  with half the marjoram, thyme, bread crumbs, and the salt and pepper to  taste. Make a second layer, alternating the two squash with the onions.  Pour the chicken stock into the dish. Sprinkle the remaining marjoram,  thyme, bread crumbs, and salt and pepper over the surface. Sprinkle with  the Parmesan. Cover with aluminum foil and bake until the squash is just  tender, 35 - 45 minutes. Uncover, and cook until the squash is very soft  and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 15 - 20 minutes more. Serve warm.    Recipe by: Martha Stewart Living Magazine, 10/97    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #832 by LBotsko@aol.com on Oct 8, 1997
