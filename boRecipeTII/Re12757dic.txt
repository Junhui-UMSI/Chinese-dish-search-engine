Yucatan Quiche
Eggs, FILLING, Shredded Monterey jack, Corn tortillas; up to 8, Safflower oil; (up to 1 cup), Sausage; cooked and drained, Avocado; sliced, Refried beans, Snipped cilantro leaves, PRESENTATION, Tomato; sliced, Half-and-half or cream, Crust, Salt, Mild green chilies; diced, 
In a medium-size skillet, heat the safflower oil. Dip each tortilla briefly  to soften and seal and then press between paper towels.    Spray a 9-inch pie pan with a non-stick vegetable coating and then line  with the prepared tortillas, overlapping them, extending about 1/2 inch  over the pan edge.    In a small bowl, combine the eggs, half-and-half or cream, and salt. Set  aside. Sprinkle half the cheese over the tortillas, followed by the beans,  sausage, chilies, and then the egg mixture. Evenly distribute the remaining  cheese over the top. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 30 minutes or until  firm.    Garnish the baked quiche with avocado and tomato slices. Place cilantro  leaves over the top. Serve warm.    Storage, Freezing, and Advance Preparation: This is as good at room  temperature as it is hot, but it does not freeze very well.
