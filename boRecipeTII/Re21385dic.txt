Unleavened Bread or Matzah
Salt, White flour, Whole wheat flour, Vegetable oil, Water, 
I found this recipe in the AOL Cooking Club cookbook.    Mix the flour and oil in a large bowl until crumbly. Add water and mix.  Roll out, form into flat disk or square shapes, and bake at 350oF for about       25    minutes. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest by Faygie@aol.com on Apr 2,  1997
