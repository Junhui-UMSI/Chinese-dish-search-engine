Serves 4 to 6. Bring the stock to a full boil in a saucepan, add the mint  and parsley sprigs, reserving the chopped herbs for garnish; reduce heat  and keep the stock at a bare simmer.    Heat the oil in a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan and cook the shallots over  moderate heat, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until soft, but not  browned (about 8 minutes). Stir in the rice and saffron and cook, stirring  constantly, until the edges of the rice become translucent, about 5  minutes. Add the wine and lemon zest, and cook, stirring constantly, until  the wine is absorbed, about 3 minutes.    Remove the herb sprigs from the stock. Add about 1/2 cup of the simmering  stock to the rice, and cook, stirring constantly, until all the stock is  absorbed. Continue adding stock, about 1/2 cup at a time, and cooking,  stirring constantly and letting each addition be absorbed before adding the  next, until the rice is a dente, about 20 to 25 minutes; season with salt  and pepper about halfway through the cooking. With the last addition of  stock, gently fold in the peas.    Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheese and lemon juice with  about 1 tablespoon of the parsley and one tablespoon of the mint. Serve  immediately, garnished with the remaining chopped herbs and pass additional  cheese.
