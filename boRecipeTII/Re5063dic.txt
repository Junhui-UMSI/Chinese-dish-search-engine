Combine ground beef, oats, egg, salt, Worcestershire sauce and tomato  sauce thoroughly.  Shape meat mixture around olives to form 18 meat balls.    Alternate 3 meat balls, 2 tomato wedges, 2 green pepper pieces, 1 potato  and 1 mushroom on six 12-inch metal skewers.  (To be sure meat balls stay  on skewers, thread through the olives in the center.)  Brush kabobs with  French dressing.    Place in broiler or over hot coals about 6 inches from source of heat.  Cook about 8 minutes.  Turn; brush again with French dressing.  Cook about  4 minutes longer or until done.
