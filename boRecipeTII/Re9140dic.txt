Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 18:0 1. Trim  meat of excess fat and cut into 2-inch cubes. In a large bowl, whisk  together vinegar, 2 tablespoons of the oil, salt, pepper, bay leaf, garlic,  thyme, and orange peel. Add meat, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and  refrigerate for 12 to 18 hours. Drain meat, reserving marinade. Pat meat  dry with paper towels.    2. In a Dutch oven or large skillet with lid, heat remaining 2 tablespoons  olive oil over moderately high heat. Brown meat well on all sides. Add wine  and reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 3  minutes. Reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer. Cover and cook until meat  is meltingly tender (about 3 hours). For best flavor, allow stew to cool to  room temperature, then refrigerate, covered, overnight. Reheat gently to  serve. Ladle stew into warm soup bowls, over buttered noodles, if desired,  and garnish each serving with parsley.
