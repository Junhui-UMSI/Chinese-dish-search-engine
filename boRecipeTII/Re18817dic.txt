And More Homemade Tamales
Reg  jar, Jar, Garlic powder, Cumin, Meat-venison roast/pork, Chili powder, Massa, Salt, Roast mix -- any roasts, - 3/4 can, Jar, Lard -- (the big can), 
Boil the meat with garlic powder until mushy.  Drain broth and flake mushy  meat. Season  with all the cumin and salt.  Add 1/2 cup of the broth back  to make the consistancy more mushy. (you can do this step the day before)  Mix the lard, salt and chili powder to the Massa. Add in enough of the  broth to make the Massa spreadable. Take one package of corn husks which  have been soaked for 30 minutes in water and separate. To make the tamales,  spread some Massa mixture (about 1 or 2 tablespoons) over the corn husk,  about 1/4 inch thick, starting about 2 inches from the bottom of the husk.  This part will have no Massa and will be folded over the tamale to seal it.  Put about 1 tablespoon of filling into the tamale, roll, fold over the  empty corn husk to seal. When you have made about 2 to 3 dozen, stand  upright in a pan with either a steamer or wadded aluminum foil to keep the  tamales straight, open end up. Put about 2 inches of water in the pan and  pour more broth INTO the open ends of the tamales to soak. Cover and steam  for 45 minutes to an hour. (Increase or decrease steam time depending on  how many tamales are in the pan) The great part of this recipe is tasting  the batch you just made to see if it is tasty. Increase the heat by adding  a diced jalapeno or serano pepper. The chili powder adds enough heat to  spice them, but children can still eat them. The peppers are for the  die-hard dragons in the group. Also, if you dont get the Massa salty  enough you should adjust that.  Vary each batch, label, wrap 6 to a package  with freezer paper and enjoy!
