Prepare the dressing by combining the wasabi, garlic, soy  sauce, ginger, lemon juice, rice wine vinegar brown sugar and the first  measure of mustard. Mix well. Refrigerate. Toss the mushrooms with the  peanut oil. Bake until crispy (about 15 minutes). Set aside in an airtight  container. Prepare the salad by combining the watercress, romaine,  cucumber, radish and bean sprouts. Cover. Refrigerate. Coat both sides of  the salmon fillet with the second measure of mustard. Add the reserved  spices. Pan sear until golden on both sides. Remove from the pan. Serve  individual portions over salad portions. Deglaze the pan in which the  salmon was cooked with the dressing. Pour the resulting sauce over the  salmon. Garnish with mushroom chips.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
