Tofu Bourguignon
olive oil, Whole wheat pastry flour, Tarragon, Garlic cloves; pressed, Tamari, Mushrooms, Dry Red Wine, Firm tofu, Bay Leaves, Thyme, Sliced onions, 
Place the pieces of tofu in a large, shallow dish. Mix together the wine,  tamari, and garlic.  Pour the mixture over the tofu, add water as need to  cover it, and let it marinate for at least one hour. If the tofu is going  to marinate for more than an hour, place in the refrigerator.    Place the marinated tofu on a well-oiled cookie sheet, reserving the  marinade.  Bake at 375oF for 35-45 minutes or until crispy and brown. Turn  the tofu over once during the baking so that it browns on both sides.    While the tofu bakes, heat the oil in a large pan and slowly saute the  onions.  When the onions are almost tender, add the mushrooms and the  herbs.  Saute for a few minutes more. Add the flour and mix well. Remove  the pan from the heat and stir in a little of the marinade. Continue  stirring until a paste is formed. Return the pan to the heat and slowly add  the remaining marinade, stirring constantly. Add the baked tofu and simmer  until thickened.    Serve over pasta, rice or millet.
