Trim away any visible fat from the steak.  Sear the steak in the oil over  medium to med-high heat.  Place the steak in a casserole dish. For extra  flavoring, pour the water into the skillet you seared the meat in, and  stir.  Pour this over the meat, then add all the other ingredients. Cook  uncovered at 350F for 30 minutes, or longer if you prefer your meat well  done. Makes 4 servings, 4.5 oz each, plus sauce, but without optional  gravy. LIGHT GRAVY: (Optional) Heat 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil, and stir  in 2 Tablespoons of whole-wheat flour. Take a cup of liquid from the meat  and stir into the roux. Stir until thickened, and serve over the meat.  Using the Gravy adds 30 calories and 3 grams of fat; nutrient values of the  meat liquid and other ingredients are included in the original analysis.
