Praline Almond Fudge Ice Cream
Light brown sugar, Vanilla extract, Eggs, almonds, milk, Chocolate fudge topping, Whipping cream, Salt, Flour, Butter, 
I believe Betsy wanted some ice cream recipes. This one comes from my ice  cream maker, a Rival. Ive tried it and it is delicious.    Combine brown sugar, flour and salt in saucepan. Gradually stir in milk,  cook over medium heat approximately 15 minutes or until thickened, stirring  constantly. Gradually stir about 1 c. of hot mixture into beaten eggs. Add  to remaining hot mixture, stirring constantly. Cook 1 minute longer and  remove from heat. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Combine whipping cream and  vanilla in large bowl; add chilled mixture, stirring with wire whisk to  combine. Saute almonds in butter over low heat about 5 minutes (watch that  they dont burn). Stir into ice cream mixture. Freeze as directed. Swirl  chocolate fudge topping though ice cream after it has stopped churning.  NOTE: I also have added about 3-4 T. crushed peppermint candy close to the  end of the freezing period. Makes 2 quarts.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Phyllis Braun <pbraun@IDIR.NET> on Dec 29, 1997
