Peanut Butter Chicken (Or Pork)
Soya sauce, Chicken, tomato paste, Onion, Peanut butter, peaches, Sambal olek, 
submitted by: reep@datanet.ab.ca (Evelyn)  OK, my spouse is starting to wonder about all the mail I am getting from  Dave. Time to send some back. This is a recipe that I received from my  Tante Siemke (in Holland) a few years back. It is likely an Indonesian  recipe. I call it Peanut Butter Chicken, for want of a better title.    Fry meat, add onion frying until onion is soft. Add tomato paste, soya  sauce, sambal and peanut butter, simmer about 5 minutes. ( Watch carefully  as peanut butter sometimes burns) Add peaches and enough juice to make a  nice sauce. Simmer a few minutes longer. Serve with rice.    Sambal can be adjusted to suit individual tastes. This is a very simple  recipe, and can be ready to eat in under 20 minutes.
