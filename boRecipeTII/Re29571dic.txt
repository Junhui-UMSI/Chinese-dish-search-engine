Tarte Dalsace
Sugar, Liquid smoke; (optional), Salt and pepper to taste, Unsalted butter, Eggs, Uncooked 9 inch shells of, Spanish onions, Sour cream, Bacon bits; (or substitute), 
Peel and slice the onions, across the rings, in slices about 1/2 inch wide,  and then cut again in 90 degrees so that you have pieces roughly 1/2 inch  wide by 1 1/2 inch long. Melt butter in a large, heavy iron skillet, or in  a heavy Dutch oven, until bubbling. Add all the onions and saute on high  heat. When onions turn slightly brown, add the sugar and a dash of liquid  smoke and then continue to brown the onions. Continue stirring the mixture,  cooking until the onions are a rich chocolate brown in color. This may take  up to 30 minutes but is the key to the full flavor of the authentic tarte.  Set the onions aside to cool. Beat the eggs and blend in the sour cream,  salt and pepper. When the pan that you used to cook the onions are cool  enough to touch, add the egg and sour cream mixture. Whisk together well,  picking up all the browned coating on the pan as you do. Distribute the  combined eggs, cream and onions equally into the two uncooked pie shells.  Sprinkle the bacon bits on top and bake in a 400 degree oven for one hour  or until the top of the pie is a rich golden brown and the crust is crisp.  Serve immediately. Excellent as a main course for lunch or brunch or as a  starter for formal dinners. Hints: Onions may be sauteed a day in advance  and the final preparation begun just prior to baking. Pre-baked pie crusts  are not recommended since the long cooking time for the quiche mixture  might cause the exposed crust to become burnt. The liquid smoke provides a  very authentic flavor to the tarte since the Alsatians normally bake this  quiche in wood ovens.
