Add onion and carrots, cover and simmer 5  minutes or until tender.   Add the garlic and saute for a moment. Add 1 of  the cans of beans and mash with a potato masher. Add the other can of beans  along with the broth and bring to a simmer with the sage. Simmer 10 minutes  or until as thick as you like it.
