Ground beef, Egg, Matzo meal, Cabbage Head; frozen, Pepper, Seasoning Salt, Sugar, Sour Salt, Tomato sauce, 
Put cabbage in freezer for @ 1 hour. Take out and under water, pull apart  or cut the leaves. Rinse and drain them. Or, they could be cooked in  boiling water for 15 minutes instead of freezing.    In saucepan, place tomato sauce on low flame. Put 1/4 of can of water in  the sauce can and rinse the can, getting all the sauce off of the can. Put  the saucy water in the saucepan. Add sour salt and stir. Add sugar and  stir. Taste to see if more of one item is needed. If too bitter, add 1/8 c.  sugar. Let simmer.    Mix together the meat, egg, seasonings and matzo meal. Take a full  tablespoon of meat and place on the thick part of the leaf and roll up,  bringing in the sides too.    Place cabbage rolls in a baking pan or a large pot. Pour sauce over them.  Cook on a low flame on top of the stove for 1 1/2 hours covered. Stir or  shake slightly the pan to move the cabbage rolls; dont let the bottom  burn. Makes 12 rolls.
