From: Gabriele DANNINGER <A4422DAD@helios.edvz.univie.ac.at>    Date: Thu, 19 Aug 93 11:19:24 MEZ  The Aprocot Balls (Marillenknoedel) are one of my favourite dishes. It is  very popular in Austria. Since I am not used to write recipes in english,  there may be some errors in it. Please be not upset. Now follows the  recipe.    Mix white cheese, butter (soft, not directly from the refrigerator), egg  yolks and salt. Add the flour and make a soft mass. Form a roll with a  diameter of about 5 cm. Cut slices of about 1 cm, press flat on your hand.  Put an abricot (remove the kernel and put in a piece of sugar) on top of it  and form a ball. Put into a pot of simmering, slightly salted water. Let  simmer for about 10 minutes.    Put breadcrumbs, sugar and cinnamon into a pan where you melted the butter  and roast it until it takes a golden colour (you can also smell, when it is  finshed, but be careful it soon may be too late).  Roll the balls in the  roasted breadcrumbs, put powdered sugar above and eat very hot.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
