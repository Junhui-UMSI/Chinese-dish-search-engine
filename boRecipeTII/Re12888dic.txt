Zatar Bread
Bread flour, Sugar, olive oil, Zatar, Salt, Rapid or quick yeast, Water, 
Someone recently mentioned the Israeli spice, zatar, and that reminded me  that I found a great recipe for zatar bread, for bread machines. Heres the  amounts for the 1 and 3/4 lb. loaf size.    Source:"The Bread Machine Cook Book-Vol.5" by Donna German    Yield: one 1 and 3/4-lb. loaf (pareve)    Put in ingredients in whatever order is recommended for your machine:    Dump it all in, let er roll, and enjoy!
