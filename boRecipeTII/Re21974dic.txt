It will be smooth and not very sticky. Dust hands with cinnamon  to be able to handle the dough. Dust a rolling pin and board with cinnamon  and roll out to about 1/4 an inch thick or more. (thinner dough than this  tends to curl during baking) Cut out with holiday cookie cutters.    Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 150 degrees for one hour. Remove from  the cookie sheets and bake on the oven racks for another hour and a half.    Decorate with fabric paints, candy-shaped beads, silk holly, or whatever  you want. Hot glue a ribbon or a small magnet to the back, or hot glue  several to a ribbon wrapped grapevine wreath. (Ho, Ho, Ho)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /MISC    From rec.food.cooking archives.
