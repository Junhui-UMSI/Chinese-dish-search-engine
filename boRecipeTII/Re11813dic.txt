Make filling. Cook spinach in a large pan with a knob of butter for a few  minutes and drain well. Cool, wring out excess water with your hands. Chop  and mix with the ricotta cheese, yolks and half the parmesan. Season with  nutmeg, salt and pepper. Roll out pasta onto a lightly floured surface.  Make two sheets about 16 by 10 inches. Place small spoons of filling on  pasta in rows, leaving space around each mound. Brush pasta with lightly  beaten egg whites then position second sheet of pasta on top. Press gently  to exclude air, then firmly to seal. Use a pastry wheel to cut into ravioli  parcels. Carefully slide ravioli into a pan of boiling water and cook for  3-4 minutes, hoping they dont fall apart like mine do occasionally . Serve  drizzled with melted butter, more nutmeg and parmesan.
