Form into balls and bake at 400 degrees for 20 min  or form into patties and cook in nonstick skillet. Alas this is also  probably a bit high in sodium, because of the bean flakes and the chutney.  The latter is available in Asian grocery stores--I highly recommend it if  you like coriander (cilantro). Unlike many other chutneys or pickles I see  around it does not contain oil. The mint version is also good. If anybody  has recipes for Indian pickles or chutneys, please post. I love hot food  but not swimming in oil. Some day when I get time I might like to make my  own Indian pickles..    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #52    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
