Powter Oven Roasted Fries
olive oil, Baking potatoes, Salt, Garlic powder, 
Peel potatoes and cut into 1 1/2 inch strips to look like a fat french fry.  Toss with olive oil, garlic and salt.    Spray a baking sheet with oil and wipe off excess.  Place potatoes in a  single layer and bake at 400 for 40 mins until crisp on the outside and  tender on the inside.
