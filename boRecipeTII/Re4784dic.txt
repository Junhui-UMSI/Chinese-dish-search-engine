Use a large skillet with cover. Heat olive oil and brown beef in hot oil  until red of meat disappears. Combine onion, green pepper, tomato, garlic,  bay leaf, crushed oregano, and capers. Add to meat in skillet. Mix well and  cook covered for about 10 minutes on moderate heat. Cut olives into thin  rounds.  Add to the meat mixture together with the vinegar, tomato sauce,  burgandy wine, hot sauce, sugar, and nutmeg. Stir well and cook 5 minutes,  uncovered.  Now add the water and mix well. Correct seasoning. If salt is  needed, add it at this point (the salt released from the olives may be  sufficient for your taste). Cover the skillet and cook at low heat for  approximately 30 minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed. If the  liquid is not absorbed sufficiently at the end of 30 minutes, cook  uncovered until liquid evaporates. Serve over long grain white rice and  ripe fried plantains if available.
