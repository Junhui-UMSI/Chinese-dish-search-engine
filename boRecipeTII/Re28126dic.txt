Baked Crab Sandwich
Garlic powder, Cheddar cheese, Onions, Loaf french bread, Crab meat, Tomatoes, Lemon juice, Sour cream, Mayonnaise, 
Slice bread or rolls lengthways. Remove excess bread to allow for filling.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees Combine the mayonnaise and sour cream in a  bowl. Add remaining ingredients and stir. Stuff the bread loaf or rolls  with crab mixture. Wrap in aluminum foil with the "boat" open on top. Bake  25 minutes. Slice if using the loaf and serve.    NOTES : "Soft rolls work just as well, perhaps better as they are easier to  bite into. Evie thinks that these are to "die for" and equally good cold.
