Flatman Family Chicken and Egg Noodles - Crockpot
Carrot, Rosemary, Season salt, Garlic, EGG NOODLES, Eggs, Flour, SOUP, Water, Chicken gravy mix, Chicken, Onion, Celery, 
Combine eggs and flour.  Add additional flour if needed to make stiff,  smooth dough.  Roll out and cut into strips, set aside to dry. Note:  General rule of thumb; 1 egg per person plus as much flour as can be worked  into it.    Combine rest of ingredients in slow cooker and cook on low 5-6 hours or  until vegetables are tender.    Add noodles to soup and cook additional 3-4 hours or until noodles are  tender.    Notes: When I have it, I substitute home made chicken stock for the water  and chicken gravy mix. Also, sometimes just use chicken bullion cubes  instead of the gravy mix.    Also can be cooked on the stovetop but watch carefully it doesnt stick as  the noodles will soak up a lot of broth.
