From Zov Karamardian of Zovs Bistro in Tustin. Serve as an appetizer with  pita bread. The salad is best right after its dressed, although you may  assemble the salad components and the dressing ahead of time. You may also  halve the recipe, if desired.    INSTRUCTIONS: Combine all salad ingredients in a large bowl.    To make the dressing: Combine the tahini, parsley and garlic in a food  processor; process until the parsley is almost pureed. With the motor  running, add the lemon juice and enough water ( 1/2 cup or more) to bring  the mixture to the consistency of creamy salad dressing. Season with salt  and pepper.    Add the tahini dressing to the salad (you may not need all of it). Toss  well. Taste and adjust seasoning. Yields about 7 cups.    ?1998 San Francisco Chronicle Page 1/ZZ1  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on Apr 19,  1998
