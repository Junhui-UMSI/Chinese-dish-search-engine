Place  in large heavy-bottom pot with half of onion, 1 T. garlic, 1 t. pepper,  salt, oregano and cumin. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Simmer  slowly until liquid has evaporated. Continue cooking on low heat until meat  begins to brown. Remove meat and shred coarsely. Saute remaining onion and  garlic in 3 oz. rendered fat in same pot until translucent. Add shredded  meat, remaining pepper cloves and cinnamon. Cook over low heat 10 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes, raisins and almonds and cook until  almost dry. Divide into 10 portions. Form into 9 x 1-1/4 inch tubes, wrap  well in plastic and freeze until solid. (Rolls keep well 2-3 months in  freezer.) Reserve 2 frozen rolls for next step.    Cut pork loin into two 9-inch lengths and butterfly. Wrap each length  around 1 frozen stuffing roll and truss to keep shape. Roll in jerk  seasoning. Heat oil in large saute pan and brown pork on all sides.  Refrigerate overnight to marinate and thaw stuffing. Place pork on rack in  shallow pan and roast in 350 degrees F oven about 20 minutes per pound or  until internal temperature reaches 155-160 degrees F. Let rest 15 minutes  before slicing.    Serving Suggestion: Cut pork into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve 3-4 slices  per portion with mango, pineapple and pepper salsa.    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Mar 22, 1998
