Randys Pizza Crust
Salt, Yeast, Dry milk powder, WATER; WARM, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Bread flour, Yellow mustard, 
Put water in the breadmaker pan.  Sprinkle yeast over top.  Sprinkle sugar  on yeast (this speeds up the proofing time).  Add oil.  Add flour, milk  powder and salt.  Add mustard.    Set breadmaker for dough and wait.    I find that the mustard makes the dough easier to handle and adds an almost  undetectable flavor to the dough. Makes great bread, too.
