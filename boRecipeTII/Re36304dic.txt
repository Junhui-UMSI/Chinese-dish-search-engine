Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours. Combine  sauce ingredients in a bowl; mix well and set aside. COOKING: Set wok in a  ring stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches. Place over high  heat until oil reaches about 375 degrees F. Add half the bean thread  noodles and deep-fry for about 5 seconds or until they puff and expand.  Turn over and cook other side. Lift out and drain on paper towels. Cook  remaining noodles.  Place noodle on a serving platter, pressing down on  noodles to flatten slightly; set aside. Remove all but 2 Tablespoons oil  from wok.  Add beef, 6 or 7 pieces at a time, and cook for about 1 to 1 1/2  minutes on each side or until done to your liking.  As beef is cooked,  transfer it to a bowl; set aside while cooking remaining beef. Return all  beef to wok and place over medium heat. Pour sauce over beef and cook,  stirring to coat well, for 2 minutes. Spoon beef over noodles and sprinkle  with green onion.  Serve hot. TIPS: Adjust the amount of Tabasco sauce to  taste. For a spicier flavor, substitute sweet bean sauce for hoisin sauce.
