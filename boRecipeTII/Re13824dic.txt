Cube steak into bite sized pieces In separate  pan, rubbed with olive oil, sear meat quickly until brown outside, but rare  inside. Add sauteed vegetables, chili powder, oregano and garlic. Season to  taste. Mix well. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve at once, alone, or  with side dishes of rice, tortillas and green salad, tossed with  vinegar-oil dressing and dry red wine. MC formatting by  bobbi744@sojourn.com  Notes:  This has a lovely flavor. The broth is very thin and I thought best  served over hot cooked rice. I only added the tomatoes to the other  vegetables when I added the beef, so the tomatoes would not become too  mushy.
