Semi-puree the veggies. I usually use a Bamix, because they are chunkier  that way.  However, for the picnic I used a blender since I was making a  bigger quantity.  Add all the other stuff and mix and refrigerate over  night. Thats it.  No fat (other than the hot oil), no animal products,  lots of vitamins and fiber. :>    From: Carol Bryant                    Date: 08-17 Cooking -    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 21, 98
