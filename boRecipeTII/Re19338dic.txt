Tagines are flavorful Moroccan stews loaded with cooked vegetables and  signature spices like cumin, coriander and ginger. This version is a  wonderful opportunity for vegetarians to experience international fare at  its best. Serve over couscous for a true Moroccan meal.    PREHEAT OVEN to 350 degrees. In large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium  heat. Add shallots, garlic, ginger, celery and cinnamon stick and cook,  stirring often, until shallots and celery begin to soften, about 5 minutes.  Add coriander, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper and cayenne. Cook, stirring  constantly, until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes,  carrot, green beans, squash or sweet potato, cauliflower and fennel. Add  enough vegetable stock or water to cover vegetables. Stir in saffron.    Cover and bake until vegetables are tender, 40 to 45 minutes. About 5  minutes before stew is done, stir in chickpeas, olives and prunes. Stir in  parsley just before serving.    NOTE: Type of tomatoes used will determine amount of stock or water needed  to cook vegetables. Crushed tomatoes will require adding about 1 cup water  to cook. Diced tomatoes may not require as much water. Stovetop cooking may  require slightly more water. The finished stew should be somewhat dry, not  soupy, and vegetables should be tender and shapely, not soggy.
