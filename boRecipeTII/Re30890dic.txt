Tangy Rosemary Peasant Bread
Yogurt (you can substitute, Ground rosemary, Yeast, Sourdough starter, Warm water, Whole wheat flour, Sugar, Salt, 
I made this for my mother as a Christmas gift. This makes a 2 pound loaf:    Combine water, sugar and yeast. When the yeast has proofed, add remaining  ingredients.    Add enough white flour (about 4 cups) to make a barely sticky dough. Knead  until elastic. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down  and shape the loaf and let rise again.    I bake this in a clay cloche because it makes a wonderful crust. To do  this, shape the loaf in the cloche bottom and let rise the 2nd time.  Preheat the cover for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Put the cover on the  bottom and bake covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes more.    If you dont have a cloche, just bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes, until the  loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
