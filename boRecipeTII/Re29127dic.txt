BTW does anyone know why garlic cloves (raw) and sugar cubes are handed out  at a Pidun Haben?    I allow 1 cup of  raw rice for 10 people if there are alot of other side  dishes being served or 1 cup raw if few sides dishes served.    Place all ingredients into 9 by 13 pan (I use deep disposables) cover very  well with foil.  Bake for aprox 45 minutes.  This recipe multiplies well  and I was able to put 3 cup of raw rice (and the appropriate proportions of  other ingredients into a deep disposable pan.
