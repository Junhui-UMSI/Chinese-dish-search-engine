Wolfgang Pucks Viennese Beef Goulash
Onion, Thyme, garlic, Water, Salt and pepper, Tomato paste, Sugar, Beef shank, Vinegar, Dried marjoram, Bay Leaves, Paprika, caraway seeds, Vegetable oil, 
1. Cut the meat into good size cubes. Slice the onions.    2. Heat heave casserole dish. Add oil, onions and sugar, and saute until  golden brown. Add tomato paste and paprika, and deglaze immediately with  the vinegar and the water or chicken stock.    3. Bring the mixture to a boil then add the meat, bay leaves, marjoram,  thyme, caraway seeds, garlic, and a little salt and pepper.    4. Cover and simmer for about 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender.    Notes:    1. The volume of the cut raw meat and the sliced onions should be about the  same.    2. I prefer the sweet Hungarian paprika to the domestic one.    3. I prefer making the goulash a day ahead. I think it tastes even better  when its reheated.    4. Serve with Austrian bread dumplings, noodles, or boiled potatoes.
