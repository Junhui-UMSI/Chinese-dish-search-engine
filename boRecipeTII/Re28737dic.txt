Bring to a  boil and simmer for 3 hours, from time to time skimming off the foam.    STEP TWO: To Make the Gumbo-- Make the roux of flour and vegetable oil  until dark and brown. Add the bell peppers, red and black pepper, celery,  and onions. Remove the ducks from the stock and reduce the broth to 2-1/2  quarts. Strain and pour over the roux. Simmer the gumbo for 20 minutes.    Remove all the meat from the bones, dice in 1/2-inch squares, and add to  the gumbo. Broil the sausage, slice, and also add to the soup. Add the  oysters and scallions at last and bring to a boil.    Serve over rice with Tabasco sauce as needed.
