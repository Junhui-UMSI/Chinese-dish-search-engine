I have tried every way there is to  prepare ribs on the grill. It is dangerous muck about with this recipe. I  once even tried to use spare ribs and my wife almost cried. These are  perfect.  There is a BBQ joint in heaven. It has one thing on the menu.  This is it.    One rack of  baby back pork ribs per moderately hungry person    marinate in cider vinegar for a few minutes    liberal amounts of garlic salt    liberal amounts of canned black pepper    The smoker should be at 200-225F. Use a pan of water in the smoker.  Mesquite, hickory, or oak chunks on natural charcoal. Briquettes are filled  with petroleum and coal and will give you laboratory rats in your bladder.  No amount of homebrew will flush them out either. I wont even discuss the  evils of propane. Should take 2 1/2 hours. For an good afforadble smoker,  look at the Brinkmanns Porfessiona    Thats it? Yep. Dont change a thing. Dont use fresh ground pepper or  cloves of garlic. If you need sauce( you wont ), it goes on the side.  And  yes, chipotles en adobo make for a great BBQ sauce.
