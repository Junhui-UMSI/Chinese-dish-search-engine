Taco Rolls
(small) green chilies, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, (8 oz) sour cream, Flour tortillas; (up to 8), (8 oz) cream cheese, 
After the cream cheese has softened, mix all the ingredients except te  tortilas in a med. sized bowl. Spread on the tortillas evenly. Then, roll  them up just like you would a buritto and refrigerate for a few hours,  preferably overnight. Slice into pieces with an approximate width of an  inch.    Note: i usually make these with the fat free sour cream and cream cheese so  that i can reduce he fat and make it fit in with my mothers diet. i think  they taste wonderful whether you use the regular, reduced fat, or no fat  cream cheese and sour cream. Also, the lady we got the recipe from used to  put a sm. can of black olives in the mix. since we do not like black  olives, we omitted it. ENJOY!!
