City Chicken
Pork stew meat, very lean, Stewing beef, very lean, Saltine crackers, Salt, Paprika, Poultry seasoning, Egg, milk, Oil, Low sodium chicken broth, 
I usually buy city chicken already skewered but, of course, you can buy the  meat loose and skewer it yourself. Heat oven to 350=80. Combine crumbs,  salt, paprika, and poultry seasoning in a bowl. Combine egg and milk in  another bowl. Dip meat in egg mixture, then in crumbs, Brown slowly on all  sides in hot oil. Pour chicken broth over all. Cover and bake for 30  minutes; uncover and bake 30 minutes more.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "John Padley" <jspadley@worldpath.net> on  Aug 21, 98
