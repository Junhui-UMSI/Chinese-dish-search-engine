Wash the chicken, pat it dry with papper towels, and season liberally with  salt and pepper.  In a mortar, crush the garlic into a paste with the cumin  and rub the garlic paste into the chicken.  Place the chicken in a  nonreactive bowl; pour the orange juice over it, cover, and refrigerate at  least 1 hour or overnight. Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserving  the marinade) and pat dry. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil over  medium heat until fragrant, then brown the chicken on all sides. Add the  reserved marinade, the sherry, onion, and stock, reduce the heat to low,  cover, and simmer until the chicken is fork tender, 35 to 45 minutess.  Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Strain the sauce through a  colander and return it with the flour to the pan. Cook the sauce over low  heat, stirring, until it has thickened, 5 to 6 minutes, correct the  seasonings, pour over the chicken, and garnish with the parsley.
