Recipe by: St. Louis Post-Dispatch 12/22/97 To make batter in a blender:  Combine eggs, salt, flour and milk in the blender jar; blend at high speed  for 2 to 3 seconds. Turn off the machine, scrape down the sides of the jar,  and blend again for 40 seconds.    To make the batter by hand: Beat the eggs and salt with a whisk or rotary  or electric beater until frothy. Slowly add the flour, beating constantly,  then pour in the milk in a thin stream and beat until the mixture is smooth  and creamy. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    To bake in a 10-by-15-by-2 1/2 inch roasting pan: Heat the fat over  moderate heat until it sputters. Briefly beat the batter again and pour it  into the pan. Bake in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes or until the  pudding has risen over the top of the pan and is crisp and brown. With a  sharp knife, divide the pudding into portions and serve immediately.    To bake in 12 muffin tins: Put 1 teaspoon or more of roast drippings in  each tin. Heat in oven until drippings sputter. Briefly beat batter again  and pour into individual muffin tins, filling 2/3 full. Bake in middle of  oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees. Bake 15 minutes longer or  until muffins are puffed and lightly browned. Serve immediately.    Yield: 6 to 8 servings; 12 muffins.    Recipes adapted from "Our House," Assistance League of Denver.
