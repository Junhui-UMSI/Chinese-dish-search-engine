I made yogurt cheese the other day and made two good flavors,    In either case, mix well and let it sit over night.    And in the rice cooker question, many have posted good ideas. I find that  if I use 1.5 times the suggested white rice water amount, then my brown  rice comes out fine. So if I put in 2 cups of brown rice, then I fill the  water up to the "3" mark. Be sure to wait the 15 minutes after the ding (or  whatever your rice cooker recommends). Posted to fatfree digest V97 #058 by  Katherine Albitz <kra@sdd.hp.com> on Apr 15, 1997
