Flour plus flour for, Salt, Dried mushrooms,; ground to, Dust, Dry yeast; (1/4 ounce), Sugar, Butter, Warm milk (100-115 degrees), 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a bowl combine 5 cups of flour, mushroom  dust, and set aside. Add yeast to 1/2 cup of the warm milk along with 2  tablespoons of sugar, stir well until the yeast is completely dissolved.  Allow the yeast to proof for 5 minutes. In another bowl place remaining  milk, butter, and salt. Stir in flour mixture, 1 cup at a time, using a  wooden spoon. After the 3rd cup, add yeast mixture. Continue stirring in  the remaining flour until the mixture is rather firm. Place the dough on a  floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, then place in an oiled bowl, and  coat the dough completely with oil. Allow to proof for 1 1/2 hours or until  it doubles in size.    Deflate the dough by punching it down 2 to 3 times, and knead for about 4-  5 minutes. Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape into round  loaves. Place on a well buttered sheet tray, about 8 inches apart. Using a  sharp knife, make 2 to 3 slits in the top of the dough. Cover with a light  towel and let rise again until doubled in size. Bake for 35- 40 minutes or  until a hollow sound is heard when it is tapped on the bottom.
