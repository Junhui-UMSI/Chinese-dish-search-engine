Raisin or "Funeral" Pie

Dessert among the Pennsylvania Dutch is almost always pie. This one is so  named because in the old days it was often served to weary travelers who  had come to the house for a funeral. It is good for the sad sick soul, and  very good without the grief. But we must remember that these people see  balance in all things, just as the "seven sweets and seven sours" (see  Pickled Eggs).      Now, after that involved description, let us get on to the pie.      In a 2-quart saucepan combine the raisins, 1-1/2 cups of the water, and 1  cup of the sugar. Bring to a boil. In another bowl combine the remaining  1/2 cup water, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar plus the flour, egg yolks, and  salt. Blend well and stir into the raisin mixture. Continue stirring until  thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, lemon juice, and  rind.      Allow to cool slightly.      In the meantime, prepare the meringue. Whip the egg whites until they  form stiff peaks. Whip in the sugar. Pour the raisin mixture into the baked  pie shell and cover with the meringue.      Bake at 350? for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
