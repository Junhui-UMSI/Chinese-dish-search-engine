Yam and Split Pea Soup with Fresh Ginger
Dried split peas, Celery, Braggs aminos, Water, fresh ginger, Carrots, Leeks, Yams, Salt, Cayenne pepper, 
Place all the ingredients except the cayenne pepper in a large pot. Add  water so that there are 2 inches of water over the vegetables. Cover, bring  to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 2 hours, or until all the  ingredients are mushy.  Stir often to prevent sticking. If the soup becomes  too thick while it is cooking, add some boiling water, or your can thin it  with a bit of water at the end of the cooking time for a lighter soup. Add  cayenne pepper, adjust the seasonings, and serve.    From "The High Road to Health" by Lindsay Wagner & Ariane Spade
