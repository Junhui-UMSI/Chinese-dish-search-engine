Watercress Basics and an Orange Chicory Walnut Salad
Classic French vinaigrette, Orange; cut into supremes, Walnut pieces, Chicory, Watercress leaves, 
"Preparation is a doddle" SPRIGS - you simply slice off the top half,  complete with a couple of inches of stalk (the rest can be saved to flavor  vegetable stocks or soups) LEAVES, NO STALKS - you simply slash them off  clean from the top.      Watercress is best used as quickly as possible, but to prolong its vigor,  STORE it in the fridge, with the leaves plunged head down into a bowl of  cold water and the stalks waggling upward. I find this the best way to keep  it bright and dandy.    Watercress is a king among garnishes and should always be used with  generosity. It brings an instant flash of perky color to just about any  plate of food, with the added bonus that it contributes a distinct, fresh  taste that complements not only roast game, but fish, eggs and cheese, as  well. In salads, it introduces a PEPPERY taste that is every bit as  appetizing as the ubiquitous arugula. One of my favorites is a combination  of watercress, orange, chicory and walnuts tossed with a little French  dressing.    Of course, watercress is much more than just a garnish or a salad  green.... Its also an ingredient for soups and sauces.
