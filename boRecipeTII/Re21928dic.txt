Applesauce
Lemon Peel, Water, Sugar to taste, Lemon juice, Gravenstein apples, 
COMBINE APPLES AND WATER IN heavy-bottomed pan. Place over low heat and  cook, stirring occasionally. When apples begin to get tender, add sugar to  taste but be sparing until apples mash easily--thats when you can tell  just how sweet you want the applesauce. Add lemon juice and cook until  applesauce is ready to be mashed with fork. Remove from heat and add lemon  peel. Mash with tines of fork, leaving some coarse texture. Serve warm.
