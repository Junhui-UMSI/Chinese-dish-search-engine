Plain Pancakes #1
Butter, milk, Sugar, All purpose flour, Baking Powder, Eggs, Salt, 
These are really quite good --- they remind me pancakes served at old-time  diners.  Very buttery and simple.  Recipe can be doubled easily.  Just  remember not to stir too much once the flour is in.  Chopped fruit can be  added once the bubbles form as the first side of the pancake cooks.  (Makes  around a dozen 4" pancakes or 6 larger ones.)     Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until they are thoroughly blended.  Put the  butter and the milk in a small saucepan and warm over low heat until the  butter has melted.  Set aside and allow to cool a little --- dont add this  mixture to the eggs while its hot or the eggs will cook prematurely.  Stir  the butter mixture into the eggs and mix well.  Put the flour, sugar,baking  powder, and salt into a bowl and stir with a fork until well mixed.     Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir only until dry  ingredients are well moistened.  Dont overmix.     Heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water dance on it, then  lightly film with grease. Drop 2 or 3 Tbsp. of batter for each pancake on  the griddle...Use larger amount for larger cake. Cook until bubbles break  on the surface. Turn the pancake over and cook another 30 seconds, or until  the bottom is lightly browned. Serve the pancakes hot.
