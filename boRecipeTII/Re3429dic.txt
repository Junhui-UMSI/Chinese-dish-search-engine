Pecan Catfish and Sweet Potato Chips
Seasoned bread crumbs, sweet potato, Brown mustard, Peanut oil, Honey, Catfish fillets, Orange, Pecans, 
Here is a fish recipe that uses both the sauteeing technique and the  pecans, to a completely different effect.    Cut catfish into 1/2x2" fingers. Brush with brown mustard and honey.  Dredge in a mixture of pecans ground with seasoned bread crumbs and  set aside. Saute potato in peanut oil until crisp and brown and drain  on paper towels. Add oil to pan amd saute fish until it flakes to the  touch. 4-5 minutes per side. Serve fish with the chips and orange  wedges.
