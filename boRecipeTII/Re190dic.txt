Ladyfingers
Eggs, Egg whites, Granulated sugar, Vanilla extract, All purpose flour, Tub-style safflower, Cornmeal, 
Ladyfingers  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites to soft peaks; gradually beat in 1/3 cup of the sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.   In  a small bowl, whisk egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored.   Whisk in vanilla.  Fold into egg whites (because the recipe makes so many ladyfingers, the amount of cholesterol-bearing egg yolk in each one will be small.)  In a flour sifter, combine remaining 1/3 c sugar with flour.  Sift into egg mixture and carefully fold.  Grease ladyfinger pans or small muffin tins with margarine.  Sprinkle with cornmeal.  Spoon batter into pans until each section or cup is about 2/3rds full.   Bake about 12 minutes or until nicely browned on the outside.   Cool on racks.  If desired, sprinkle with confectioners sugar.    Makes 3 dozen.
