From Will Greenwood, not-quite White House chef.    For the rub: Combine the chili, garlic and onion powders, the sugar,  salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper and paprika in a food processor  until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub  on all sides of the salmon. Let fillets marinate for 6 hours.    To cook the salmon: Prepare a very hot grill. If you are using wood  chips on the hot coals, first soak these in water so they will smoke  more. Add soaked chips 5 minutes before starting the salmon.    Rub the fillets with a thin film of olive oil. Grill them  approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness.    For the field greens and vinaigrette: Clean and refresh the greens in  cold water. Spin dry. Mix the vegetable juice, vinegar and tomato  together with the reserved barbecue rub and olive oil. Toss with the  greens.    To serve: Divide greens among plates. Top each plate with a salmon  fillet. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette in the bowl over the salmon.  Serve hot.
