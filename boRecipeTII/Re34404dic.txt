Bean Burgers By Anita Cecena
Egg whites, Minced green onions., Cooked drained pinto beans, Chopped fresh parsley, Seasoned rice vinegar, Minced garlic., Cracker meal or bread crumbs, Italian seasonings (oregano,, White wine/stock, 
Preheat oven 350 degrees. Saute onions/garlic in stock/white wine. Combine  with beans, cracker meal, egg whites, parsley, vinegar, seasonings. Mash  well with fork until blended, but not entirely smooth. (Here I depart from  recipe...I make up a bunch of hamburger sized patties, freeze some,  refridge some, and cook them as needed for about 20 minutes in a toaster  oven...I know they are done when the egg/bread crumbs are brown and the  patty is a bit dry.  I find this basic recipe can absorb many, many  changes.Ive used white beans, black beans, whatever, sauteed mushrooms,  hot sauce, catsup, etc. The main thing is to get a good  texture/cohesiveness in the final product, so it sticks together. Have  fun!)
