Three Sisters Ice Cream
FOR 6-QUART ICE CREAM, Milk to fill freezer can 2/3, Can Frozen orange juice, Vanilla, Bananas, , mashed, Salt, Eggs, Sugar, Can Pineapple, , crushed, Milnot, (2-3 cans), 
(Refreshing "Tootie-Fruity" flavor)    Beat eggs. Mix all ingredients except milk and put into freezer can. Add  milk to fill freezer 2/3 full.    Freezing instructions: Assemble freezer. Pour ice (fine ice is better)  until it is about 3-inches deep. Sprinkle 1/2 cup rock salt around the can.  Layer ice/salt until it is just above the lid of the can. If too much salt  is added the ice cream will freeze too fast around the edges of the can.  Crank until the mixture becomes stiff. Open the lid, being careful not to  get salt into the ice cream, and remove the paddle. Put Glad Wrap on top of  the can and put the lid back on. Put a cork into the hole in the lid of the  can. Pour out some of the water from the hole in the side of the ice cream  freezer. Take out some of the ice and add more salt and put the ice back  in, so the salt gets throughout the ice (makes it freeze harder). Cover the  ice cream freezer with several layers of newspapers and a heavy blanket.  Let set for about 30-45 minutes before serving.    Put left-over ice cream into an air-tight container and freeze in freezer.  This ice cream freezes well and is still smooth after being frozen.    NOTES : Do not drain pineapple or mix up frozen orange juice - just dump  them "as is" into the mixture.
