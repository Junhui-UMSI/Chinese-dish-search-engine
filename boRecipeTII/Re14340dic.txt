* This recipe uses a lot of whole grains, but it will turn out excellently  if you use all-purpose flour in place of any or all of the whole grains.  Also, any of the whole grains are interchangeable with any of the other  whole grains in the recipe.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 2 loaf pans.  Beat oil, brown sugar,  and molasses until well blended. Blend in egg and pumpkin. Stir flours,  brans, wheat germ, soda, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and salt into mixture  just until moistened.  Fold in nuts. Fill pans and bake about 1 hour, until  pick comes out clean. Cool on rack. Better if served the day after cooking.    This bread freezes well.
