In a mixing bowl, combine condensed milk, lime rind, lime juice, salt, and  egg yolks (see NOTE below). Stir until well mixed and thickened. Pour into  baked pie shell (See NOTE). Cover with a meringue made of 3 stiffly beaten  egg whites into which 2 T of sugar have been folded. Bake in 350 degree  oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove and allow to cool. Flavor is enhanced by  chilling in refrigerator. chilling in refrigerator.  NOTE:  I use a ready made graham cracker crust.  Brush with Egg Beaters, or  you can use egg white, and bake it at 375 degrees for 5 minutes. Let cool.    Also, I replace the eggs with Egg Beaters, using 1/2 cup instead of 3 egg  yolks.  For topping, I use low fat whipped cream instead of meringue.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #258 by Jack Elvis <jackelvis@moonlink.net>  on Sep 30, 1997
