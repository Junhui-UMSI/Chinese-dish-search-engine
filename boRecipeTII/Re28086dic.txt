Mix in bacon, green pepper, green onions, celery and  parsley. Fold in bread crumb mixture. Shuck clams and place in half-shells.  Top each with bread crumb and vegetable mixture.

Soy sauce is used in  place of salt and other flavor enhancers. As a variation, oysters may be  used in place of clams. Also, fresh Maryland backfin crabmeat may be added  to butter topping.
