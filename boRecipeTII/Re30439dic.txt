Banana Jam (Weird But Good)
Water, Lemons, Olive-sized pieces of fresh, Ripe bananas, mashed, Sugar, Some whole clovers, Ginger, 
Squeeze juice from lemons and slice the rind into paper thin strips  Boil the sugar and water for 10 minutes, then add the juice and rind,  the bananas, ginger and a few cloves (to taste).    Cook slowly for 1/2 to 3/4 of an hour. Stir carefully so it wont  scorch. Itll be pale (actually a weird pinkish color.) Take out  ginger. Put in jars and process 10 minutes in water bath covered by  1". About 7 8oz jars.    This is truly a strange "jam." But its delicious on toast, waffles,  or muffins, and little kids like it.    I discovered by accident that banana jam also makes a truly wonderful  filling for one of my favorite desserts, a little number called  Farfel Cake (which contains no farfel and is not a cake.) I will  provide it. It really is a great recipe--easy to make, delicious to  eat and even a little impressive to look at.  Great with hot coffee  or tea.
