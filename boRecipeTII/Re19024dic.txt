Vegetable Broth
fennel, Bay leaf, carrots, garlic, Onion, Mushroom stems, Fresh thyme, Black peppercorns, Leeks, Turnips, Parsley, Dry white wine, Dried thyme, 
Combine all ingredients except peppercorns and wine in a 4-quart pot.  Pour over just enough water to cover and heat on high heat until  liquid comes to a boil. Turn heat down, cover pot and keep broth at a  slow simmer.    When vegetables have simmered 30 minutes, add peppercorns and white  wine and simmer for 10 minutes more. Strain through a medium-mesh  strainer into a clean pot or heat-resistant plastic container. Let  broth cool, uncovered, for an hour before putting it in the  refrigerator.
