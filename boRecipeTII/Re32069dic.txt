1. Preheat broiler, heat a charcoal grill until coals form white ash, or  preheat a gas grill to medium.    2. To prepare sauce, in a small saucepan, combine ketchup, vinegar,  horseradish, brown sugar, garlic, and thyme. Mix well. Bring to a boil over  medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 5  minutes. Remove from heat; stir in pepper.    3. Brush tops of chicken pieces lightly with sauce. Place chicken,  sauce-side down, on a foil-lined broiler pan or grill rack. Brush other  sides lightly with sauce.    4. Broil or grill 3 inches from heat, basting with remaining sauce and  turning until no longer pink in center, about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Let  chicken stand for 5 minutes before serving.
