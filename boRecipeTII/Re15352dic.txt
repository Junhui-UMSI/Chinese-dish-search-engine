Heat olive oil in a wide skillet and add garlic. Cook briefly. Add  white beans and heat through. Add sage, broth and pepper. Lower heat  and simmer.    Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles. Cook until al  dente; they should be cooked through but just barely. Drain pasta  well. Place in a large serving bowl and toss with beans and about  half the cheese, salting to taste. Top with remaining chesse. Garnish  with fresh sage, if you have it. Serve with baked carrots and  Italian-style bread (or bread of choice).    In the summertime, you could add a cut-up garden tomato, or several  quartered cherry tomatoes.    To bake carrots: Peel and trim 4 or 5 large carrots. Cut them on the  diagonal about 1/2" thick. Toss with 1 tablespoon olive or vegetable  oil. Spread in a 9x13" baking pan (or on a shallow baking sheet).  Season liberally with salt and pepper and bake at 400F. for 30  minutes, or until browning and tender. These are also good if you  throw in a few chunks of red bell pepper.    White bean vegetable soup: Add a diced carrot, onion and rib of  celery to the olive oil when you add the garlic. Cook until soft,  then proceed with recipe. Add a can of water when you add the broth.  Cook 8 ounces of noodles separately as instructed in the recipe, then  add to soup, adding more water or broth if you think the mixture is  too thick. Serve in bowls with cheese on top.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/tn-94q3.zip
