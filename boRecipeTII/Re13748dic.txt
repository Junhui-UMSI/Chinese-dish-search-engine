Wild Rice Soup --Byerlys
Salt, Onion, Carrot, Slivered Almonds, Half and half, Cooked Wild Rice, Dry Sherry, Flour, Chicken broth, Ham, Snipped Parsley, Butter or margarine, 
Melt butter in saucepan.  Saute onion until tender.  Blend in flour;  gradually stir in broth. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to  a boil;  boil and stir 1 minute. Stir in rice, salt, ham, carrot, and  almonds; simmer about 5 minutes.  Blend in half and half and sherry; heat  to serving temperature.  Garnish with parsley. Makes 5 1/2 cups. I always  add the ham, carrots and almonds.  They add a lot!
