Pita Bread (Large Quantity)
Active dry yeast; ( 220 gm ), you also could use fresh, Sugar; ( 240 gm ), Malt syrup; 0ptional (90 gm), Shortening; optional (120, Bread flour; ( 10 kg ), Water ; (4 1/2 L), Commercial dough, Water; (1 L), Salt; ( 170 gm ), 
(about 124, 4 0z units )    Dissolve yeast in water and set aside to proof( foam ) Dissolve sugar,  salt, malt in water.Add the flour to it and stir well. add the dissolved  yeast and mix well to form a dough. Add the shortening and mix well and let  rise until light. Punch down and let rest 20 minutes before shaping. Scale  ( weigh out ) into units( pieces )of 4 0z balls and let rest 15 minutes.  Roll out to 1/8 inch thickness or slightly thicker circle. Place on sheet  pans or peels dusted with cornmeal. let proof ( rise ) 3/4 in volume.Do not  dock ( prick ). they will become puffy related to the fermentation when  they are baked as the moisture is released. Bake in an oven or hearth on  peels or baking sheets 460 degrees ( 237 to 240 C ) about 6 minutes. Units  will be pale but done. They will collapse partially when cool. However when  baked properly the pita will have an open pocket of dough.    Note: Typically in the Mid East a  10 to 11% protein flour is used. If you  use a stronger flour ( more gluten/protein ) your water amount will be  variable. Note2: make sure your water temp is about 80 degree fareheit to  maintain proper dough temperature Note 3: shortening is only added as a  lubricant to the dough but it does help condition the dough Note4: if you  plan to go commercial may I suggest you use dough conditioner to inhibit  mold and increase shelf life. I dont know how you plan to use the 1000  pitas!! But good luck and glad I could help somehow!!
