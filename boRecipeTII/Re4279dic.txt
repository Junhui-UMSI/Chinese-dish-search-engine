Perogy Filling- Roasted Garlic and Potato
Potatoes, Pepper, Milk, garlic, Cream cheese, Salt, Vegetable oil, 
Canadian Living, December 1996.    In large pot of boiling salted water, cook potatoes, covered, for about 20  minutes or until tender. Drain well and return to pot; mash with potato  masher until smooth.    Meanwhile, in small saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic  and reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10  minutes or until golden and softened.    Mash garlic and add to mashed potatoes. Blend in milk, cream cheese, salt  and pepper, stirring just until smooth. Let filling cool to room  temperature. Filling can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 24  hours. Makes about 4 cups (1L), enough for 7 1/2 dozen perogies.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #374, by Peg Baldassari  <75402.3465@compuserve.com> on 15 Jan 97.
