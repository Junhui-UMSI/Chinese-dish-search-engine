1. Place eggs in cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently  12 to 15 minutes.    2. Meanwhile mince or grind pork. Blend cornstarch and cold water to a  paste; then add to pork along with sherry and ginger juice, mixing well.  Divide mixture into 12 parts. Form each into a ball, then flatten into a  thick patty.    3. Cool eggs thoroughly under cold running water; then shell. Cut each egg  in half lengthwise. Then cut a small slice from the back of each half so  that it will lie flat when turned yolk side up.    4. Arrange eggs yolk-side up on a shallow heatproof dish; top each with a  meat patty. Steam for 10 minutes (see "How-to Section"). Drain eggs,  reserving the liquids.    5. Heat oil. Carefully lower in stuffed eggs, meat-side up. Deep-fry,  basting with hot oil, until golden. Drain on paper toweling.    6. Meanwhile in a saucepan blend steaming liquids, soy sauce, salt, sugar,  and remaining cornstarch. Bring to a boil, stirring to thicken. Then pour  sauce over eggs and serve at once. VARIATION: For the pork, substitute  beef.    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4. Downloaded  from G Internet, G Internet.
