Warm Potato Salad
Garlic, Vegetable oil, Tabasco (opt), Ground nutmeg, Salt, Pepper, Vinegar, Parsley, Potatoes, 
Quarter the potatoes and boil until tender.    Meanwhile, peel and mince garlic and place in a small jar. Wash and  dry the parsley, cut the stems off, then mince the parsley. Place in  the jar with the garlic. Add oil, vinegar, Tabasco if using, nutmeg,  salt and pepper. Screw the lid on the jar and shake vigorously to  dissolve the salt.    Drain potatoes and, when they are just cool enough to handle, slice  them thinly onto a serving platter or into a bowl. Drizzle with  dressing and serve hot, warm or cold.    Serves 6 and makes great leftovers. You may also add various fresh  herbs thyme, marjoram or dill, for example, if you have them in your  garden.    Serve the potatoes with roasted chicken and asparagus.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
