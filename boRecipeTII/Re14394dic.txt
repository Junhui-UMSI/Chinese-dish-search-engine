Combine 3 cups flour, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl; stir and set aside.    Combine milk, water, butter, and honey in a medium saucepan; place over low  heat, stirring constantly, until mixture reaches 120? to 130?. Stir milk  mixture into flour mixture, and beat at medium speed of an electric mixer 2  minutes or until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a stiff  dough.    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; let dough rest 10 minutes.  Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 3 minutes). Place in a well  greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place  (85F), free from drafts, for 50 minutes or until dough has doubled in  bulk.    Punch dough down, and divide in half; shape each portion into a loaf. Place  in 2 well-greased 9- x 5- x 3-inch loaf pans. Cover and let rise in a warm  place, free from drafts, 50 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 375?  for 35 to 45 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Brush loaves  with melted butter; remove from pans, and let cool on wire racks.    Yield: 2 leaves.    Whole Wheat Rolls: Punch dough down after first rising, and divide dough  into thirds. Working with one third, divide into 8 pieces; shape each into  a ball. Place 8 balls in a lightly greased 9-inch round cakepan. Repeat  procedure with remaining dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free  from drafts, 40 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 375F for 20 to  25 minutes or until golden brown. Brush rolls with melted butter.    Yield: 2 dozen.
