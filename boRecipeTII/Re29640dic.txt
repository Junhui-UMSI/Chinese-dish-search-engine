Salt and pepper steaks to taste. Raise heat to medium-high. Place  steaks in covered skillet, 5 to 8 mins. each side [depending on your  preference for rare to medium, hubby says well done is burnt, I dont eat  much meat].When steaks are done, put on a platter and keep warm in the  oven.    Wine sauce: reduce heat to medium-low, adding 2 to 3 Tbls. of butter in the  same skillet, add diced shallots and sliced mushrooms. Sautee for about 5  mins. or untill tender. Deglaze skillet with 1 cup wine. Let reduce. Wisk  in remaining butter untill sauce thickens slightly, pour over steaks.    Best served piping hot, so have all ingredients ready before starting to  cook the steaks. Also the use of prongs to handle meat are preferable.  Piercing the meat may release the juices.
