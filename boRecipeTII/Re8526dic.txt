Potatoe Soup with Cheese, and Bacon
Potatoes, Onion, Bacon, milk, salt and pepper, Butter, cheddar  cheese, Flour, celery, 
Grind bacon into small bits, I used a food processor for this.  Cook in skillet till done.  Pour off grease over diced potatoes in pot.  Place bacon on paper towel to absorb the rest of grease and cool.  Place bacon in a serving bowl for a topping.  Dice Onion and add to pot.  Slice *thinly* stalk of celery and add to pot.  Add enough water to cover the potatoes by an inch.  Bring to a rapid boil, salt and pepper to taste.  In a skillet, melt butter. Take off heat.  Stir flour into butter.  Once potatoes are soft, add milk.  Bring to boil again.  Heat flour and butter mixture to thicken.  Add this slowly to soup until to your desired thickness( This happens  REAL quick!)  Remove from heat.  Serve immediately. (This is to get my daughter away from me ;-)    Place in soup bowl, Top with goodly amout od shredded cheese.  Top this with bacon bits and some chives.
