Recipe by: Nicki  Fritz  <FRITZ@QHORSE.STX.COM> I tried (with a few minor  modifications) the Apple Pie muffins Marg posted, and they were wonderful!  They are the first muffins that actually have the consistency of regular,  non-lf muffins.  I did use the cake flour as Marg suggested, but I had  tried that in other muffin recipes, and still got that very rubbery  consistency that lf-sweet things tend to have. [nf]    Mix wet ingredients, and add dry.  Stir until everything is moistened  (these make a very wet batter). Spray a muffin pan with Pam, and fill the  muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake at 400 for 15-17 minutes, until a tootpick comes  out dry.    This was half of the original recipe, and made 9 average muffins. If I had  a bigger pan, it probably would have made 6 nice-sized muffins. Each has  less than 1 gram of fat per muffin.
