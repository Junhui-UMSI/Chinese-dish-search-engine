Chocolate Walnut Meringues
Unsifted powdered sugar, Cocoa powder (not a mix), Jumbo egg white, Finely ground walnuts, 
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 300F. Beat all the ingredients together at the highest  mixer speed for about 1 minute, or mix them in a food processor fitted with  the metal chopping blade for about 30 seconds. The mixture will be about as  thick as fondant. With a stockinette- covered rolling pin, well-dusted with  powdered sugar, roll the mixture on a board, also liberally dusted with 10X  sugar, until it is 1/4-inch thick. With a 1 1/2-inch cutter dipped in 10X  sugar, cut the meringue into small circles. Reroll the scraps and cut as  many meringues as possible. Space the meringues about 1 1/2 inches apart on  baking sheets. The baking sheets should be liberally dusted with flour.  Bake them uncovered for 15 minutes. Cool the meringues for about 5 minutes  on the baking sheets; then, with a spatula, carefully loosen them. Transfer  them to wire racks. When they are cool, store them in airtight containers.
