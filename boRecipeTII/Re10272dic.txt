SERVES 6      I rarely eat dessert, but I do live in one of the most important apple  producing regions in the world. Now and then I have to enjoy an apple  dessert and this one is easy and very tasty. It comes from our Washington  State Apple Commission.      Beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg  and salt. Gradually stir in the flour until a soft dough is formed. Cover  tightly and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Then roll dough on a lightly  floured surface to a 10-inch circle. Place in a 9-inch glass quiche pan or  round tart pan.     Heat a medium frying pan and add the 2 tablespoons butter. saute the  apples in the butter for about 5 minutes. Add the 1/4 cup sugar and the  cinnamon. Toss.     Arrange the apple slices in the pastry shell and bake at 375? for 15 to 20  minutes, or until the pastry is golden. Brush the apples with the marmalade  and return to the oven for about 2 minutes. Remove and cool a bit before  serving.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
