Avocado and Cucumber Soup (No Cooking Required)
Cloves of garlic, Water (or 1 C ice cubes), Cuccumbers. seed if the, White pepper, Plain non fat yoghurt, Nice and ripe avocados;, Chopped scallions, 
In a bowl, combine all but 1 C of the cuccumber, avocadoes, garlic,  parsley, yoghurt, water or ice cubes, pepper. In a blender puree this  mixture in batches until smooth, transfering it to a bowl or pitcher.. When  everything is blended, add in the reserved cup of cukes and the scallions.  Mix and chill at least 1 hour.    Variation: I dont recommend this, but I did see someone put vodka into his  bowl of soup once. He said that if we can mix vodka with tomato juice, why  not with avocado and cuccumbers.... Posted to fatfree digest V97 #179 by  Gloriamarie Amalfitano <gma@adnc.com> on Aug 14, 1997
