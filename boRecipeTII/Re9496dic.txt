Pumpkin Butter, As Made in the North Woods
See directions, 
Take out the seeds of 1 pumpkin, cut it in small pieces and boil it  soft; take 3 other pumpkins, cut them in pieces and boil them soft; put  them in a coarse bag and press out the juice; add the juice to the first  pumpkin and let it boil 10 hours or more to become the thickness of butter;  stir often.  If the pumpkins are frozen the juice will come out much nicer.       Remarks:  All I have to guide me as to the "North Woods" manner of  making is that on the back of the slip cut from some newspaper; there was  the date of the paper - Feb. 7, 1880 - also "Sleighing fair," and "Loggers  feel better," therefore, to know that "loggers felt better," they must have  that class of persons among them; and hence it was from some northern  paper, where loggers in the winter do congregate. It will make a good  butter if boiled carefully to avoid burning. I should say boil the juice at  least half away before putting in the nicely cut pieces of the 1 pumpkin,  boiling it soft in the juice of 3 other ones, after its reduction one half.  It makes a very good substitute for cows butter, and for apple butter,  too.  But I must say if I used frozen pumpkins to obtain the juice from, I  should not want the one frozen that was to be cut up to make the butter of.  I think it would not be as good if frozen. If any of these butters are too  sour add good brown sugar to make it sweet enough to suit the taste.                                              --Ann Arbor,     1884    Source:  Walnut Pickles and Watermelon Cake, A Century of Michigan Cooking,  Larry B.
