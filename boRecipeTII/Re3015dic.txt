Peanut Butter, and Other Nut Butters
Instructions:, 
To Make Peanut Butter and Other Nut Butters:    Process up to the recommended amount of nuts. (My note: nowhere could I  find the recommended amount of nuts, so I assume you would process about  4 cups of nuts at a time in an 11-cup processor.) Let the machine run  continuously. After 2 or 3 minutes, the ground nuts will form a ball that  will gradually smooth out. Scrape the sides of the bowl and continue  processing until drops of oil are visible. Taste for consistency. The  longer you process, the softer the butter will be. For chunk style, add a  handful of nuts just after the ball of nut butter begins to smooth out.    To make cashew butter, add a little bland vegetable oil.    Processor nut butters contain no preservatives. Store in the refrigerator  to keep them without separating.
