The  menu grew out of the ongoing love affair that Polly Mellinger and her  husband, Michael, began with New Mexico about 10 years ago. So strong is  their attachment that they bought a house in Taos five years ago and now  spend about a third of their time there.    The recipe she shares today was one of her Internet finds (source unknown).  In recommending it, she said: "Not only does the compote taste wonderful  and different, but the house smells incredibly good when its brewing." --  November 23, 1998, interview by Sarah Casey Newman, St. Louis Post  Dispatch.
