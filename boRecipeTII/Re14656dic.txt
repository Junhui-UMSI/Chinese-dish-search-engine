Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Stir in currants and add enough milk to make a soft dough. Roll out dough  on a floured surface to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out 2-inch circles with a  biscuit cutter or glass, and place on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes,  or until well-risen and lightly browned. Serve hot, sliced crosswise, with  butter and jam.
