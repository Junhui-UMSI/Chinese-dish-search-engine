Lemon Cake Pie
Sugar, Flour, Butter, Salt, Eggs, juice and peel of 1 lemon, Milk, Unbaked pie shell, 
Combine sugr, flour, butter or margerine, salt, and egg yolks in mixer  bowl. Beat until smooth. Beat in lemon juice and peel. Add milk, beating  slowly. In another mixer bowl, beat egg whites stiff, but not dry. Fold egg  whites into lemon mixture. Bake pie shell at 350 degrees for 5 minutes.  Pour in filling. Bake 40 minutes, or until filling is firm. When cut, there  will be a delicate cake on top of the pie mixture.    Personal notes: 1. The first thing I did was beat the egg whites and set  aside. 2. Then I did the pie shell and baked it for 5 minutes, then set it  aside. 3. Then I did everything else. But since I didnt have a fresh  lemon, I substituted 1/3 cup real-lemon juice. Kenny said it needed more  lemon, so Ill add 1/2 tsp lemon extract next time. i usually dont have  fresh lemons on hand. 4. I used the Pillsbury unfold pie crust. This is  better than my home-made pie crust which resembles something that is  produced by Goodyear or Michelin. 5. I was able to remove it from the oven  at about 30 minutes. I checked the center with a knife, and it came out  clean.    I served this with a generous helping of Cool Whip, but whipped cream, the  real stuff, would be better. And there are no more leftover pieces of pie.  I just polished off the very last one. This is a perk that comes with being  the last one to go to bed at night...you get to eat the good stuff left in  the fridge. Posted to EAT-L Digest 23 Mar 97 by "Sharon H.
