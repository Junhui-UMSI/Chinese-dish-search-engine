Filling: ========         Soak your golden raisins in plum wine overnight or longer.         Depending on the ingredients available to you, mix appropriate  quantities up so as to fill the dough. You can certainly use more or less  of each ingredient to suit your individual tastes. Youll need about four  cups total filling.    Assembly: =========         Spread the two sheets of phyllo dough out on your work surface, one on  top of the other.  Paint the top layer of dough with some of the melted  better and then spread a nice thin layer of toasted coconut over the entire  pastry.         Pour your filling along the long edge of the phyllo dough, and roll  the dough up as tightly as possible (remember to fold in the ends as you  roll so the ends are "sealed") and put on a non-stick baking sheet.         Paint the top of the roll with melted butter and bake at 350 F until  the dough is golden brown.         When done, take the strudel out of the oven and let it cool on a rack.  Just before serving, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the top. Slice  the roll on a diagonal for a more attractive presentation.         For elegant presentation, you might serve the strudel pieces on a  plate with slices of kiwi, orange, lemon, and pear as garnish.
