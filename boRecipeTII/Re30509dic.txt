Taco Seasonings

From: Susan_Harwell@ftdetrck-ccmail.army.mil    Date: Wed, 03 Jul 96 08:24:17 EST  I just made veggie tacos last night. I browned some chopped onion and  minced garlic in my sprayed pan for a few minutes. Tossed in my TVP. Mine  was reconstituted in veggie beef broth. I dont think you have to  reconstitute the Green Giant crumbles, do you? Anyway, I added a two to one  combination of cumin and chili powder. In my case I was using the  equivalent of two pounds of h*****ger(Giggle! I love the way we cant even  spell the word out without cringing!), so I used 2 T. cumin to 1 T. chili  powder.  I added about a      1/4    t. oregano and 1 1/2 cups of water to moisten it. I let it  simmer for about ten minutes. Turned out great! In fact I ate way too many  tacos and am suffering today. The dry measurements are subjective. Adjust  to your taste.  Be careful if you use the broth to reconstitute TVP because  some of them contain a lot of salt.    fatfree digest V96 #184    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
