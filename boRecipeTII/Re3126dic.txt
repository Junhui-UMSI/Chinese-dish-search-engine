Coarsely chop the peanuts in a food processor,a cup at a time.Put into a  large mixing bowl and set aside.Toast the bread cubes on a baking sheet  under a broiler until the cubes are a rich golden color,stirring them  occasionally to keep them from burning.Add to the chopped peanuts.Add the  salt,black pepper,and cayenne and mix well.. In a medium mixing  bowl,lightly beat the eggs,then beat in the oil and 1/2 cup broth.Add this  to the peanut and bread mixture and mix well.The stuffing should be fairly  moist; if not,gradually add more broth until the consistency is right.Fill  the body and the neck cavities of the turkey and skewer them shut.Do not  over stuff.Put leftover stuffing in a casserole and bake along with the  turkey for the last 45 minutes of roasting time..
