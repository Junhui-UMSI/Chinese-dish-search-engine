Warm Upside-Down Cheesecakes with Blueberry Sauce
Graham cracker crumbs, Plus 2 tablespoons sugar, Unsalted butter, Water, Fresh lemon juice to taste, Cornstarch dissolved in 1, Almond extract, Cream cheese, softened, Egg, Vanilla, Blueberries, picked over, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and set rack to middle position.    In a small saucepan melt the butter over moderately high heat, stir in the  crumbs, and divide the mixture among four paper lined 1/2 cup muffin tins,  patting the mixture to form a crust. Bake    the crusts for 5 minutes and let them cool on a rack for 5 minutes.    In a bowl with an electric mixture beat together the cream cheese, 1/4 cup  of the sugar, vanilla, almond extract and a pinch of salt until the mixture  is combined well, beat in the egg, beating until the batter is combined  well, and divide the batter among the tins. (The batter will fill the  tins.) Bake cakes for 20 minutes, or until they are set, and let them cool  on a rack for 10 minutes.    While cheesecakes are baking, in a small heavy saucepan combine blueberries  with the remaining sugar, and water, bring the mixture to a boil and simmer  it, stirring occasionally for 3 minutes. Stir in the cornstarch mixture add  it to the blueberries with the lemon juice, and simmer the mixture,  stirring for 2 minutes.    Discard the paper liners, invert the cheesecakes onto plates, and spoon the  sauce around them.
