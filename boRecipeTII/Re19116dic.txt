Tommy Toys combines French and Chinese  food in this restaurant which is  patterned after the reading room of the Dowager Empress of China. The  kitchen is Asian but the menu reflects both traditions. 1-Preheat a wok or  large skillet over highest heat until very hot.     Add the vegetable oil, tilt the wok to coat, then quickly add the eggs and  stir, scrambling the eggs. 2-Add the cooked rice, stir quickly. Add the  vegetables and salt to taste. Stir and toss to blend quickly. Add the  sesame oil and soy sauce, toss to combine flavors, for about 2 minutes.
