Take  off of the heat and cool in refrigerator.  Add Grand Marnier to cooled  syrup and reserve.  (Note: three-fourths of this syrup-Grand Marnier  mixture will be used in the mousse; the remainder will be used to  bunch the various layers of the Progres.)

Chocolate Cream:  ================         Melt the chocolate, then cool.  Add half of the chocolate to the  buttercream.  Mix well, then add remainder of the chocolate (must be  done in steps or cream will break).  Refrigerate.    Assembly:  =========         Remove the biscuit from the refrigerator and cut it to the shape  of the mold.  Put bottom biscuit into mold and brush with syrup.  Spread layer of creme noisette on top of syrup.  Refrigerate for 2  minutes.         Add a layer of mousse, then place top biscuit on mousse.  Brush  with syrup again, then spread with a layer of chocolate cream.  Freeze  for 5 - 30 minutes.         Pipe layer of chocolate cream on top.
