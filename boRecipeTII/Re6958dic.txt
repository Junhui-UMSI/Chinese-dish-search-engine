Poori (Deep-Fried, Puffy Bread)
All-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, Salt, Vegetable oil, Water, 
Put the 2 flours and salt in a bowl. Drizzle the 2 tablespoons oil over the  top. Rub the oil in with your fingers so the mixture resembles coarse  breadcrumbs. Slowly add the water to form a stiff ball of dough. Empty the  ball on to a clean work surface. Knead it for 10-12 minutes or until it is  smooth. Form a ball. Rub about 1/4 teaspoon oil on the ball and slip it  into a plastic bag. Set it aside for 30 minutes.    Knead the dough again, and divide it into 12 equal balls. Keep 11 of them  covered while you work with the twelfth. Flatten this ball and roll it out  into a 5-5 1/2" round. If you have the space, roll out all the porris and  keep them in a single layer, covered with plastic wrap.    Over a medium flame, set about 1" of oil to heat in a small, deep frying  pan (I used my wok). Let it get very, very hot. Meanwhile, line a platter  with paper towels. Lift up one poori and lay it carefully over the surface  of the hot oil. It might sink to the bottom but it should rise in seconds  and begin to sizzle. Using the back of a slotted spoon, push the poori  gently into the oil with tiny, swift strokes. Within seconds, the poori  will puff up. Turn it over and cook the second side for about 10 seconds.  Remove it with a slotted spoon and put it on the platter. Make all the  pooris this way. The first layer on the platter may be covered with a layer  of paper towls. More pooris can then be spread over the top. Serve the  pooris hot (immediately).
