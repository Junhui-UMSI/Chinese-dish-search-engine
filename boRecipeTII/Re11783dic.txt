Rave Review Roast
Roast, Nutmeg, Ground oregano, Black pepper, Basil, Garlic powder, 
1 Roast must be a cut that is normally cooked uncovered in the oven. Either  boneless rump, eye of round, boneless rib, standing rib, beef or pork.    2 Do not skimp on the seasonings. Season liberally and pat seasoning into  meat. The nutmeg is the secret ingredient here so use plenty. It gives the  meat a delicious flavor plus aids in the browning process.    PREPARATION: Place roast in pan, on rack, and season so that excess  seasoning stays in pan to flavor gravy. Season with nutmeg, garlic powder,  black pepper, ground oregano and basil. Place roast with the fat side up so  the fat will baste roast as it cooks. If there is no fat on the roast,  spray the roast with Pam cooking spray. Place seasoned roast in hottest  possible oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes reduce oven temperature to  350? and continue cooking for remainder of time. Do not open oven during  first half hour of cooking. Timing the roast: 35 minutes per pound for a  beef roast (3 pound roast = 1 hour 45 minutes). 45 minutes per pound for  pork at 325?. The first 20 minutes at 500? is included and is part of the  total cooking time.
