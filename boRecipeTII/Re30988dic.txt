Banana Nut Bread (Bread Machine)
Butter, Baking soda, banana, Dark brown sugar, GROUP A, GROUP D, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Salt, GROUP E, Eggs, GROUP C, walnuts, milk, Granulated sugar, GROUP B, 
1. Place ingredient Group A in Bakery Pan. Press SELECT for Quick Bread.  Press BAKING CONTROL for Light. Press Start. Mix for 1 minute and 15  seconds, scraping down sides of pan with spatula if necessary.    2. Add ingredient Group B. Mix for 1 minute and 15 seconds, scraping down  sides of pan if necessary.    3. Add ingredient groups C, then D and then E. Scrape down sides of pan if  necessary.    4. After mixing, lower lid and tent a piece of aluminium foil, shiny side  down, over glass dome. Loaf will be ready in 1-1/2 hours.    ** Note: In order to substitute the granulated sugar and the brown sugar, I  use the equivalency amount of Sweet n Low Regular and Sweet n Low Brown.  The texture does not change the finished product.    *** Note: In place of walnuts, I use slivered almonds. They are lower in  fat than walnuts.    I have also added dried cherries, blueberries, and craisens as well. This  changes the flavor dramatically (and deliciously).    Egg substitute can also be used without a problem.    The next direction - EAT AND ENJOY!!!!  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by pikboca@webtv.net (Phyllis Kinsler) on Jun  5, 1998
