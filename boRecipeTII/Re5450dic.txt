Pineapple Cream Cheese Ball
, Green pepper, Walnuts, Cream cheese, Onion, Crushed pineapple, 
1.  Leave cream cheese on counter to soften.    2.  Drain pineapple very thoroughly (squeeze if needed).    3.  Chop walnuts, onions and green pepper finely.    4.  When cream cheese is softened (you can speed this up by microwaving on  power 30 for 1 or 2 minutes), add all ingredients, mix well and form into  ball.    5.  Refrigerate until cream cheese is firm again.    Authors Notes: This spread goes well on crackers, bagels, celery (and  other veggies) or (my fave) low salt Triscuits.    For a party, you can dress this recipe up by cutting the top off a large  pineapple, forming the cream cheese ball into an oval, putting the  pineapple top onto the cream cheese oval (so that it looks like a  pineapple), and slicing or chunking the remainder of the pineapple as  nibbles or garnish around the cheese ball.    Difficulty    : very easy. Precision  : approximate measurements.
