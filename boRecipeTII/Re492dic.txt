Cream margarine (I hate the taste of butter in this cake) well, add sugar  and eggs and cream well. Mix flour and baking powder and sift into mass  little by little mixing very well. Grate peel from lemons and mix in too.    Grease a bundt-pan and pour the batter into it. As I normally do this dough  with 250 g flour etc. instead of 454 g I use a 9" pan. For this amount this  would mean a 12.5" pan. Preheat oven and bake for about 1 hour at 180-220  degree C (356-432 F) until the toothstick-test says it is done.  Glaze: Now juice the lemons, warm the juice slightly and dissolve  confectioners sugar into it. Add enough sugar to make a thin slurry and use  this to bind the crumbs of the cake with a brush. Add more sugar until you  have a thick slurry and pour or brush onto the cake. If the glaze is too  sour add water. If you have not enough fluid add either water or more  juice. I prefer to glaze only the top and upper third of my cake.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by caba@squirrel.han.de (Carmen Bartels) on Dec  1, 1997
