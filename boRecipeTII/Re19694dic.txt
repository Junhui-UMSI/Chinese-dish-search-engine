*packed in olive oil   **packed in vinegar and oil   ***sliced, slices cut in half   ****Sliced Italian cold cuts, rolled lengthwise   On platter, arrange lettuce, leaving a hole in the middle large enough to  hold the can of tuna. Drain oil from the can over the lettuce, then place  tuna in the middle of platter.   Divide platter into sections, placing 1/2 slice of cheese in each section.  On top of cheese, place 1 rolled slice of each type of meat.   Drain liquid from red pepper jar over all, then randomly place peppers,  olives, and tomatoes around the platter. Salt and pepper to taste, then  pour more olive oil over all.   Eat heartily, accompanied by much loud Italian conversation. In fact, I  typed this accompanied by much loud Italian conversation. My parents were  here, and both were shouting instructions over my shoulder. They disagreed  about the arrangement of the lettuce - my mother said that the hole in the  middle of the platter was necessary; my father insisted that it wasnt,  saying you can just dump the tuna on top of the lettuce. I finally had to  give up on this reply until they went home. So now, in the peace and quiet  of the aftermath, Ive finished it. Hope you had a wonderful holiday.
