Vegetable Beef Minestrone
Onion, Shredded carrots, Lean ground beef, (28 oz) Contadina Crushed, Zucchini or yellow squash;, (15.5 oz) Canellini Beans, 
This soup is hearty enough for a main dish, and very easy to make. My son  calls it "Moms famous Minestrone"!    In a soup pot, brown beef until cooked throughout. Add onion, squash and  carrots; cover and cook on low for 4-5 minutes. Add tomatoes, broth and  beans; simmer, uncovered for 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.
