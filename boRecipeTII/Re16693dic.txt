Alaska Sourest Sourdough Starter
Warm water, Sugar, Salt, Bread flour, Vinegar, Yeast, 
Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Add sugar vinegar,salt,all purpose  flour. Add remaining water until a creamy batter is formed.    Place in a glass bowl,cover and let sit until it starts to ferment, about 3  days. It will take on a powerful boozy smell. Stir again until creamy and  measure out what is called for in the recipe.    Replenish starter with equal amounts of flour and water. Store in the  fridge and bring to room temp before using.    Directions say to allow to ferment for one week between uses but I dont. I  do let it sit out overnight after I feed it.    This starter took about 1 1/2 months to become really sour.
