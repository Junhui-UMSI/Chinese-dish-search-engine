Not only are the flavors of this dessert deliciously rich, but the contrast  between the cold mousse and the warm cream is almost addictive.    Prcheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the bananas on a baking sheet, and bake in the oven until they tum  black and the skins split, about 10 minutes. Let cool a little and then  peel the bananas and pur?e in a food processor or blender. Pour the banana  pur?e into 2 inch ramekins and refrigerate for 2 hours.  To prepare the Mac Nut Cream, melt the butter in a saucepan, add the sugar  and macadamia nuts, and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until the mixture  turns a dark golden brown. Stir in the cream and when incorporated, remove  the pan from the heat and cool to room temperature. When ready to serve,  warm the Mac Nut Cream gently. For the garnish, whip the cream with the  sugar until soft peaks form.  To serve, place a chilled banana mousse on each serving plate and remove  the parchment paper. Top with the whipped cream and pour the warm Mac Nut  Cream around.  Yield: Serves 6    http://www.foodtv.com/socal/recreg.htm  Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 20, 1998
