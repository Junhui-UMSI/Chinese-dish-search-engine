No, this recipe is not for passionate Peruvians.  Its for folks who  love lima beans.  (If you happen to be a passionate Peruvian, I guess  thats just a bonus!) Ive been putting recipes into my computer from  an old, hand written notebook I used to keep back in the Pencil Age  and ran across this.    Combine and bake at 350F for 3 hours.
