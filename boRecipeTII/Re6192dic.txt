This makes a nice thick sauce that will cover 2 or 3 pizzas, depending on  the size and how saucy you like your pizza (you can freeze extra for next  time, if needed).  Because my family consists of young children and a  husband who has to watch the spices, I dont add any further seasonings and  just use this at room temp (or cold) as my sauce. If you want the herb  flavoring, add approx: 1/4 tsp. dried oregano, 1/4 tsp. dried basil, Onion  to taste.    Let the sauce, herbs, and onion simmer for at least 20 minutes and use as  you would canned sauce.    Note:  I bake my crust dough 7-8 minutes before I add sauce or toppings.  Then I spread on the sauce and add the toppings and bake for the rest of  the time listed in the recipe. This allows the crust to get brown before  the cheese burns. And you can use less cheese this way---you just dont  need as much for some reason. In other cooking, I add any cheese that is a  topping (casseroles, etc.) in the last 5 minutes no matter what the recipe  says. Otherwise, when someone tries to get a spoonful, they often tear off  the whole top of the dish because the cheese is cemented together.    EAT-L Digest 29 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
