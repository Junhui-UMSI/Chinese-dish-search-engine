Taco Squares
Onions, Sour cream, Cold water, Ground beef, Bisquick, Mayonnaise, Shredded sharp cheddar, Chopped green peppers, Sliced tomatoes; up to 2, 
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 13 x 9 x 2 baking dish. Cook beef until  brown, drain. Mix sour cream, mayonnaise, cheese and onion. Mix bisquick  and water, pat in pan pressing 1/2 inch up sides of baking dish. Layer  beef, tomatoes and pepper. Spoon cheese mixture on top. Bake about 30  minutes. I have substituted 1/2 cottage cheese, 1/2 light sour cream  instead of all sour cream has worked very well.
