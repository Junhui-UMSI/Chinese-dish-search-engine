The favorite around our house is Any Vegetable  Soup, especially when I do the cooking. Here it is:    PLACE all the ingredients in a soup pot. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer  until the vegatables are tender, about 20 minutes.  Serve hot.    We used 2 cups  of carrots, 2 cups of celery, 2 cups onions, 2 cups of  potatoes, 2 or 3 cups of cabbage, 1 can of corn (2 cups). We used the  liquid from the canned corn and the remainder water (about 9 cups of  liquid).  We used the oregeno one time and and the basil about five times.  I prefer the basil.. We also used 1 teas. onion powder and 1/2 teas. garlic  powder. We use a generous amount of black pepper to give the soup some  zing.
