Meanwhile, in food processor, puree beans and oil until smooth; add to  yeast mixture. Using wooden spoon, vigorously beat in 1 cup of the all  purpose flour, the whole wheat flour and salt for 1 minute or until sticky  dough forms. Gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make stiff  dough.    Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead for about 8 minutes or until  smooth, elastic and stiff, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour if necessary to  keep from sticking.    Form into ball and place in greased bowl, turning to grease all over. Cover  with plastic wrap; let rise in warm draft-free place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours  or until doubled in bulk.
