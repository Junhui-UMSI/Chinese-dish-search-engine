Short crust pastry, Bacon, Young partridges, Egg yolk, Boned thrushes and other, Larks, Small birds, Quail, 
1. Make a firm short crust using some eggs with the water to mix the flour  and a little salt; but no sugar. 2. Roll it out but not to thin, and with  it line a tin pie mould that opens and is kept closed with a metal skewer.  3. Put in the middle of the pie 3 young partridges (boned) and 4. round  them put 6 fine quail boned and stuffed. 5. Round these put 12 larks,  boned. 6. Cut a little bacon and dice and sprinkle them into the pie. 7.  Put in some sour grapes and a very little salt. 8. And fill up with boned  thrushes ans other small birds. 9. Put in neither spice, nor cheese nor  water. 10. Ornament the top crust; make a hole in the middle; brush it over  with yolk of an egg, and bake in a very moderate oven for several hours  according to size.  Meantime make some good clear nicely flavoured game  stock that will be a firm jelly when cold; strain it, and directly the pie  comes from the oven pour it, hot, into the pie by means of a funnel placed  in the hole in the middle of the lid.    NB - This pie may be eaten hot or cold.  For a ball supper it will of  course be eaten cold.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #268 by Matt <mdj@cableinet.co.uk> on Oct  04, 1997
