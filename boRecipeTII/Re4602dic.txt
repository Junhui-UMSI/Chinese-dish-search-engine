Here is my contribution to International day. This one is German and I love  them this time of the year. This came from the Time/Life Foods of the World  series in The Cooking of Germany vol.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat two large baking sheets lightly  with butter. Combine the flour, baking powder, cloves, allspice and  cinnamon in a bowl, and set aside. In a deep, heavy 5 to 6-quart saucepan,  bring the honey, corn syrup, and sugar to a boil over moderate heat,  stirring until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat to low and simmer,  uncovered, for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from heat, add the butter and  lard, and stir until melted. Beat in the flour mixture, a cup or so at a  time. When the batter is smooth, drop it by teaspoonfuls on to the baking  sheets, leaving an inch or so between the cookies. Bake in the middle of  the oven for about 15 minutes, or until the cookies are firm to the touch  and light brown. Transfer them to a cake rack to cool, and proceed with the  remaining batches, coating the baking sheets with a little butter each  time. Pfeffernuse can be stored for 6 to 8 weeks in tightly sealed jars or  tins. Makes about 30 cookies.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #253 by Skeeter <prissb@agate.net> on Sep  19, 1997
