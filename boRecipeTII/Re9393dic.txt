Recipe by: ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2150    In bowl of an electric mixer combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, yeast, coffee,  and caraway and fennel seeds. In a saucepan combine molasses, butter,  chocolate, vinegar, sugar, salt and 1 1/4 cups of water and heat, stirring,  until warm but not boiling. With motor on low, pour it into flour mixture,  and mix for 30 seconds. Increase speed to highh and mix 3 minutes more.    Using a spoon add rye flour and as much of remaining flour as possible.  Dough will be slightly sticky. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and  knead until smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball, place in a greased bowl,  cover and let double in size. Punch dough down, turn it out onto a floured  surface and divide it into two pieces. Shape into rounds, place them on a  baking sheet (leaving them enough room to double). Cover and let rise.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Whisk egg white and 1 tablespoon water.  Brush tops of rounds with egg white glaze and bake for 35 to 40 minutes,  until brown and hollow-sounding when bottoms are tapped.
