Penne with Golden Garlic
(28 oz) imported Italian, Garlic cloves; peeled and, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Salt, Freshly grated imported, Bouillon cube; optional, Imported dried penne, 
Place the olive oil and the garlic cloves in a medium saute pan. Cook over  medium-low heat until the garlic is soft and a light-golden brown. Stir  frequently to prevent sticking. Add the tomatoes and their juices, salt and  pepper, and the bouillon cube if desired. Cook until a sauce forms.    Meanwhile cook the pasta in abundant salted boiling water. Drain well and  place in a pasta serving bowl. Add the sauce and toss well. Serve with  grated Parmesan cheese on the side.    Twelve cloves of garlic are sauteed in olive oil until golden brown, then  cooked with tomatoes. The garlic melts into the tomato sauce, giving it a  sweet, nutty flavor and sublimely creamy texture. Italians have a passion  for bouillon cubes and use them often. If you like, you can crush half a  bouillon cube into the sauce as it cooks for extra depth of flavor.
