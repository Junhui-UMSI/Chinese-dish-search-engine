"Gold Room" Scones
Raisins, Sugar, Baking Powder, Flour, Salt, Honey, Butter, Eggs, Whole Milk, 
Preheat the oven to 425F. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt  in a large bowl. Mix well. Cut the butter into the flour mixture with a  pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the eggs,  milk and raisings. Stir quickly with a fork until the dough leaves the  sides of the bowl and forms a ball. Spoon onto an ungreased cookie sheet to  form the desired number of scones. Leave at least 1" between the scones.  Bake until golden (about 12-15 minutes). Remove to a wire rack, and brush  immediately with honey. Serve at once with butter, jam and whipped cream.
