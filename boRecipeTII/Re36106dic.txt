To make peanut sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan. Add onion  and garlic and fry gently until golden. Stir in chili powder, Curry Powder,  water, peanut butter and brown sugar. Bring to a boil; simmer gently until  thickened. Stir in soy sauce and lemon juice, then salt and pepper. Turn  mixture into a serving dish. Preheat broiler. Grease a broiler pan. Trim  and cut meat in 1/2" cubes. Thread (not too tightly) onto 8 bamboo skewers,  leaving a space at each end for holding. Cover ends with small pieces of  foil to prevent burning. Place skewers in greased broiler pan. Brush with  remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Cook under preheated broiler 10-15 minutes  until golden and cooked through. Turn and brush frequently with oil during  cooking. Garnish with lemon pieces and cilantro sprigs, if desired, and  serve hot with peanut sauce.
