Aunt Anns Celery Seed Dressing
Onion, Vinegar, Dry mustard, Salt, Celery seed, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Garlic, 
Mix all ingredients together. I use my blender then I dont have to chop  the onions. This will keep several weeks in a jar with a plastic lid. Do  not use a metal lid, since the vinegar will rust the lid.    You can adjust the sugar and salt to suit your own taste. We find that 1  1/4 c sugar is too much, and so is 2 t of salt.    The dressing is especially good on a fresh fruit or spinach salad.    This recipe comes from my Husbands Aunt, Ann Mitchell.
