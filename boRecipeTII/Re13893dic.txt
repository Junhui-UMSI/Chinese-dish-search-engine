Windsor Pudding - a Right Royal Treat
milk, Caster sugar, Long grain rice, Egg whites, Butter for greasing, Cooking apples, Lemon rind grated, 
The House of Windsor is the correct name for the family our present Queen  Elizabeth II belongs to. This dish was created especially for her and can  now be enjoyed by all of you.    An exceptionally light pudding which is difficult to turn out of its  cooking dish.  For this reason I would always cook and serve it in the same  dish. Placing a small circle of greaseproof/cooking parchment in the base  of the dish can assist in its extraction.    You will also need a saucepan big enough to contain the pudding basin or or  souffle dish, with lid in place.    Grease a 1 litre pudding basin or souffle dish.  Place the rice in a pan  with the milk and cook until tender and all milk is absorbed. Allow to cool  a little.    Peel, core, and roughly chop the apples.  Stew until soft shaking the pan  from time to time in order that the apple does not stick. In the meantime,  half fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil.    Place apple and grated rind of 1/2 lemon in a blender and puree. Stir in  cooked rice and sugar.    Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry, bowl until they form fairly stiff  peaks.  Stir the egg into the apple mix. Spoon it all into the prepared  basin or dish. Cover with greasproof/parchment paper or foil, and tie with  string. Stand the basin/dish in the pan of boiling water, after first  placing an old plate in the base. The basin/dish should stand on the plate,  and the water should come about half way up the basin/dish. Put on a  tightly fitting lid and steam gently for around 45 minutes. Serve hot! From  Rons Plaice in Blackpool:)    From: Recipes
