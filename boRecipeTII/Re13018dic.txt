(You should have about 6 cups.) Place  in a large bowl.    2. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl mix vinegar, garlic, salt, sugar,  allspice, and peppercorns. Using a whisk or fork, gradually beat in oil  until well combined.    3. Pour about half of the dressing over potatoes. Add onion and mix  lightly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (or as long as over  night, if you wish).    4. Lightly mix in fennel and remaining dressing. Refrigerate until cold.
