Pork Tenderloin Roast with Apple, Onion and Garlic Gravy
Pork tenderloin, apples, Granny Smith, Onions, Garlic, olive oil, Chicken broth, Wine vinegar, Honey, Salt and pepper, 
Brown the meat on all sides in a skillet. You may use either one 3 lb roast or two 1 and 1/2 lb roasts. Remove the meat and put into a roasting pan with a close fit. In the pan in which you browned the meat, saute the onions and garlic for 5 minutes. Add the apples and continue sauteing for about 2 to 4 more minutes.   Add the broth, vinegar and honey and stir until mixed. Add salt and pepper to taste. Pour the gravy over the pork, cover with foil and bake for 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours at 325 F until the pork is done. Remove the roast from the pan and let sit for 10 minutes before carving. Slightly mash the gravy, and serve.      NOTES : Very different, this roast is tender and flavorful, very moist with  a gravy to die for.  If you have any left over, its wonderful sliced for  sandwiches. Slather with leftover gravy.
