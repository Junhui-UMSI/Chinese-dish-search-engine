Then stir in eggs. Add sugar, flour,  salt and pecans, mixing well. Pour batter in a greased 8" square pan and  bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Brownies should still be soft. Remove from oven  and let cool slightly. Poke holes in brownies with fork, and pour amaretto  liqueur over top. Refrigerate overnight. Spread Chocolate Amaretto Frosting  over brownies and then drizzle White Almond Icing in a criss-cross pattern  on top.    Chocolate Amaretto Frosting: Combine butter, sugar, salt, amaretto liqueur,  cocoa powder and coffee and beat until smooth.    White Almond Icing: Combine sugar, salt and almond extract. Add  half-and-half a little at a time, mixing until smooth.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
