The Greens Pizza Dough
Sugar, olive oil, Unbleached white flour, Salt, Whole wheat flour, Active dry yeast, Hot milk, Rye flour, Hot water, 
This is a great recipe for pizza dough from The Greens cookbook by Deborah  Madison. Combine water and milk and add sugar and yeast. Stir until yeast  is dissolved and then mix in the olive oil, salt, rye flour, and whole  wheat flour. Stir in flour to make soft dough, but only enough to keep  dough from sticking. Dough should be slightly moist. Knead on a floured  surface for 5 minutes and allow to rise in a covered oiled bowl for 30 - 45  minutes. Its a good idea to flip the dough over in the oiled bowl once or  twice when you firs put it in so the surfce is coated with oil. Roll dough  up into a ball and roll out. Stretch it to shape and roll out more to 1/8  in. thick. Add toppings and preheat oven to 500 Degrees. Bake for 8 - 10  Minutes or until dough is nicely browned. - This is supposed to make a 10  in. pizza...I usually double the recipe and make a bigger pizza.
