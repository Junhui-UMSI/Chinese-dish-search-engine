Pizza Crust 2
Butter, Dry skim milk, Sugar, Bread flour, Salt, Dry yeast, Water, 
1.  Put ingredients in bread case.  Select dough mode.    2.  When buzzer sounds, remove dough from bread case and place in a greased  bowl.  Cover it with wrap and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes.    3.  Cut into 2 or 3 portions in a round shape.  Cover with a clean cloth  and rest the dough for about 15 minutes.    4.  Flatten dough into a circle, spread it onto pie plate and prick with  fork.    5.  Glaze with pizza sauce and sprinkle with onion, green pepper, mushroom,  salami and cheese.    6.  Bake in 400 degree/205 C. oven for 15 to 20 minutes until crust is  golden brown.    We used a 12-inch pizza pan and had enough dough left to make 4 dinner  rolls a few days later. They were good too!    >From: CrissyMA@aol.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : ChefMate Bakery Oven CookBook
