African and Middle Eastern Spice Info
***  Tips *****, 
Around the Arabian Gulf, highly spiced food is still common: recipes from  the region call for complex spice blends, often with chilies. Enthusiasm  for rich spicing passes to North Africa, to Ethiopia and the countries of  the Magreb (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), where food is spiced with  pepper, cubebs, cumin, caraway, cinnamon and cassia, ginger and saffron.  Chilies and mild peppers are common too, but not all the food is  ferociously hot; many Moroccan dishes are quite delicate and subtle in  their flavoring. Further south, in both East and West Africa, chilies are  the dominant flavoring. Elsewhere in the Middle East, subtle spicing  prevails in the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey.
