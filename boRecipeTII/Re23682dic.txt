(This recipe was taken from the book, "Classics & Creations: A World of  Vegetarian Cooking," published by Science of Spirituality in 1985)    "This kugel is enhanced by the deep flavor of marinated artichokes along  with tofu, scallions and sharp Cheddar cheese.    Drain artichokes, saving marinade. Place marinade in a large bowl with  water and crackers (saltines, or matzas).    Let crackers (saltines or matzas) sand for 10 to 15 minutes until liquid is  absorbed. Stir occasionally to keep crackers (saltines or matzas) coated.  Saute scallions in 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Add scallions to  crackers along with tofu, cheese, black pepper to taste and remaining 1  tablespoon of vegetable oil. Mix thoroughly, crushing any crackers that are  not soft. Coarsely chop artichokes and stir into crackers (saltines or  matzas). Turn into an oiled 8 x 8-inch baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F.  for 40 minutes until lightly browned. Yield: 8 servings    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Sandy English <yehudit@earthlink.net> on  Apr 09, 1998
