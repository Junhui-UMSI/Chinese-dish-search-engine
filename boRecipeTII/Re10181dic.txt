Quick n Dirty Hot Nuts
Ground New Mexico red chile, Ground cumin, Black Pepper, #12 brown paper bag, Planters cocktail peanuts;, Habanero; Jalapeno, or, Ground white pepper, 
(no heating or melting of butter required!)    Toss all the ingredients in paper bag and shake thoroughly for about a  minute; then pour the peanuts back into their original containers. Discard  the nasty greasy paper bag. Great with cold beer and warm friends!    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #138 by "Gregg Puckett" <gpuckett@exo.com>  on Sep 28, 1997
