Whole Wheat Communion Bread
Butter, Flour; whole-grain wheat, Dry yeast, Dry milk, Honey, White flour, Warm water, 
This recipe is scaled for large bread machines. I recommend using the dough  cycle and baking the bread in an oven.    Put the ingredients into the bread machine and mix on the dough cycle. The  bread should be a little soft and sticky after the first knead, but whole  wheat flour will take up extra water as it rises.    At the end of the dough cycle, remove the bread dough and put it on a  lightly floured surface. Shape into about 4 small loaves, about 6 inches in  diameter on greased cookie sheets or oiled planks. Let rise until doubled  (this bread has a small amount of yeast in it and may rise slowly). Cut a  cross in the top of the loaves and allow to rise an additional 10-15  minutes. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes and reduce the heat to      325    for another 15 minutes.    Each loaf will serve 30-50 communicants. The bread freezes well sealed in  plastic bags.
