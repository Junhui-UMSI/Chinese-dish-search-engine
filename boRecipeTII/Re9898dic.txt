Punch Delicious
pineapple juice, Ginger ale, frozen lemonade, 
Chill all ingredients before mixing. If punch is not to be served  immediately, reserve ginger ale and add just before serving. Punch to be  served from a punch bowl is better if kept cold with a frozen ring mold  made from lemonade or the punch mixture. (Punch chilled with an ice mold of  water dilutes the punch as the ice melts).
