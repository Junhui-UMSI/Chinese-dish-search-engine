Marinade: Combine marinade ingredients.    Makes enough for 2 pounds of beef.    To use: Toss paper-thin slices (1 inch by 3 to 4 inches) of beef sirloin  with the marinade in a nonmetallic bowl. Refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or  overnight. Drain meat, reserving 3/4 cup of the marinade. Thread meat on  bamboo skewers.    Sauce: Remove and discard seeds from pasilla chile. Coarsely chop chile and  cover with boiling water. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Drain, and put in a  food processor with achiote paste and olive oil. Puree. Add the 3/4 cup  marinade and blend until smooth.    To use: Brush on skewers of meat. Broil or grill until meat is done, about  5 minutes, basting with marinade several times. Brush again before serving.    Adapted from Time-Lifes "Cooking of Latin America."    From an article by Heidi Haughy  Cusik, The San Francisco Chronicle,  7/1/92.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg
