"Garbage"
Dill pickles, diced, 1/2", Oranges, unpeeled, diced,, Apples, unpeeled, diced,, Saladitos (salted dried, Lemons, unpeeled, diced,, 
Place all ingredients in a bowl or jar. Proportions of ingredients are  approximately equal amounts; more or less will not hurt. Let sit for a day,  stirring occasionally until the juices are mixed and plums are rehydrated  and soft. Makes a sweet, salty,sour, goopy mess that is usually served in a  baggy for kids to eat with their fingers.    NOTES : This  looks disgusting, but kids seem to like it.BTW "saladitos"  are sold in Hispanic markets.
