Rinse chicken, pat dry.    2. coat a large ovenproof skillet with olive oil cooking spray, and preheat  over medium-high heat.  Crush 2 of the garlic cloves, and place in the  skillet.  Place the chicken int he sillet, and arrange the remaining garlic  cloves around the chicken.    3.  Cook chicken for about 2 minutes on each side, or until the chicken and  garlic cloves are nicely browned.  Remove the chicken from the skillet, and  set aside.  Remove the sillet from heat.    4.  Lay the onions and tomatoes over the garlic cloves in the skillet.  Arrange the chicken in a single layer over the tomatoes, onions, and  garlic. Pour the wine and broth over the chicken, and sprinkle with the  oregano and pepper.    5.  cover the bake at 350 F for 30 minutes, or unhtil chicken is tender.    6.  Serve hot.  (I serve this over couscous and with some bread to spread  the yummy garlic cloves on.)    EAT-L Digest 30 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
