Ginger, crushed tomatoes, Frozen corn, Potato, Cayenne, white beans, Pepper, Onion, Garlic, Salt, Peanut butter, Oil, Chili powder, 
In a large heavy pan, saute onions in oil over medium high until  translucent, stirring frequently. Add garlic and stir for 3-4 minutes. Add  everything else and mix well. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer  covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The potato pieces should be  tender. If stew gets too thick, add water.
