Apples in Red Wine
Sugar, Red wine, You NEED an apple that, cinnamon, during cooking !!, will hold its shape, Apples, 
Ten hours in advance, cook the wine, cinnamon and sugar over a brisk heat  for 10 minutes, using a broad, shallow saucepan.    Peel the apples and, using a melon-baller of about 2.5 cm (1 in) diameter,  cut them into little balls.    Throw the apple-balls into the hot wine. They should not overlap: this is  why you need a broad, shallow pan. Simmer them for 5 to 7 minutes, covered  with aluminium foil to keep them submerged.    When the apples are cooked but still firm, remove the pan from the stove.  Let the apple-balls macerate in the red wine for about 10 hours to take on  a good red colour.    Serving: well chilled, with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream, or in a selection  of cold fruit desserts.    From: Fredy Girardet, Cuisine spontanee, M-Papermac, 1985, ISBN  0-333-40957-4
