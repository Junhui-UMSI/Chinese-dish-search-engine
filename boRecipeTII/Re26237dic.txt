Tomatillo Salsa (Salsa De Tomate Verde)
Tomatillos, Garlic, serrano chili peppers, fresh, Water, Fresh cilantro, Onion, Salt, 
In a saucepan over high heat, combine the water and 1 teaspoon of the salt  and bring to a boil. Add the garlic, chilies and tomatillos and cook,  uncovered, until soft, 8-10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the  liquid. When cool enough to handle, stem the chilies and tomatillos.    In a blender or in a food processor fitted with the metal blade, combine  the garlic, chiles, tomatillos, reserved liquid, cilantro and remaining  1-1/2 teaspoons salt. Process to form a smooth puree, then transfer to a  bowl. Stir in the chopped onion.    Let the salsa cool to room temperature, then serve. The salsa can be stored  tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.    Found on most tables in Mexican homes and restaurants, this versatile  condiment enhances any savory dish. It is made with tomatillos, which are  known in Mexico as tomates verdes; and although they arent, in fact,  related to tomatoes, their size, shape and texture are similar. Youll find  them fresh, covered in their brown papery husks, in ethnic markets,  well-stocked food stores, or in fruit and vegetable shops; they are also  sold canned.
