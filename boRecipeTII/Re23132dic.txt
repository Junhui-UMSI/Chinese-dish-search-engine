In the morning, drain the  beans, rinse them under cold running water, and place them in a saucepan  with fresh water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the  heat and simmer several hours until the beans are soft and the skins begin  to split.  Add water when necessary to keep the beans from drying, and stir  occasionally to prevent them from burning and sticking. Remove from the  heat, drain, and allow to cool.    In a bowl, toss together the greens, beans and rice.  Cover and chill in  the refrigerator at least 30 minutes.  In a blender, combine the oil,  vinegar, chives, garlic, pepper, and salt.  Blend at high speed until the  chives and garlic are finely pureed.    Pour the dressing over the salad, toss, and garnish with chive blossoms.    Lois Ellen Frank, "Native American Cooking".
