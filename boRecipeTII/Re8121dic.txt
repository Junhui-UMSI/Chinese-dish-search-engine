While I dont have a "strict" recipe for potato, cheese & broccoli soup, I  do have this wonderful recipe for potato & cheese soup I found in MOTHER  EARTH NEWS (Feb/Mar 94). As I am a broccoli afficiando, myself, I have  always just added a cup or so of broccoli at then end, when reheating the  pureed soup. That way, the broccoli stays a bit crisp. YUMMY! A wonderful  meal for a cold winters night  :)    This cheese soup is lower in fat than standard versions. If you want to use  low fat cheese to reduce the amount of fat even further, make sure it has a  strong, aged flavor. I recommend using a low fat yellow smoked cheddar.    In soup pot, saute garlic & onion in butter until lightly browned. Then add  vegetables, chicken broth and water (or veg broth) to pot. Cover & simmer  for 30-40 mins until veggies are tender. Stir in milk and spices. Pour  mixture into blender & puree. Return to pot, add cheese and broccoli and  simmer until cheese melts and broccoli. Serve topped with chopped chives or  parsley.
