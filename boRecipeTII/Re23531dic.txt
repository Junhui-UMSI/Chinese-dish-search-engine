Use a 3-quart casserole with lid.  An earthenware casserole is preferable,  especially if you wish to add a touch of Spain to a dinner party. However,  I know that good earthenware is hard to find today.  I have 2 casseroles  that Ive had for 15 years. Heat oil in casserole. Saute onion and pepper  until transparent.  Add garlic, parsley, tomato, bay leaf, nutmeg, cumin  and thyme.  Mix well, cover, and cook over low heat until mushy (about 15  minutes).  The saffron should be toasting on the lid in the little brown  paper. Add the shrimp to the saute and cook until it turns pink. Dissolve  the saffron in the 1 cup hot water. Combine with wine, lemon juice, salt  and hot sauce. Pour into casserole, stir to mix, and cook covered 10  minutes more. Now add the rice and the 2 1/2 cups of water. Distribute  ingredients well in casserole.  Bring to a quick boil, STIR ONCE, and place  in preheated 325 degree F. oven for only 20 minutes - NI UN MINUTO MAS!  Remove from oven, uncover, and garnish with peas, pimientos, and parsley.  Pour beer over all.  Cover again and allow to stand 15 minutes longer,  before serving.
