Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 0:30 1. Warm a  serving dish in low oven or microwave. Spread flour in a plate and lightly  dip both sides of scallops in it, shaking off excess. Meanwhile, in a  large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the  butter with the oil until very hot and fragrant. Add scallops (you may have  to work in several batches to keep them uncrowded) and brown lightly on  both sides (about 1 minute per side). Remove immediately to warmed serving  dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and tent with foil to keep warm.    2. Pour oil out of skillet. With pan off heat add lemon juice, scraping up  browned bits. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter plus capers and 1  tablespoon of parsley. Return veal to sauce and warm briefly over medium  heat, turning veal in sauce to coat. Return veal and sauce to serving  platter, garnish with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and lemon slices (if  desired). Serve immediately.
