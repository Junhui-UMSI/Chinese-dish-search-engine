Thanks to Tina Tsovras, we have an authentic Greek recipe for stefado, or  stifatho. She and I worked together to modify it in time for Greek Orthodox  Easter, and now Im posting it for all of you (in time for whatever you  want it for!).    Dump everything into a Dutch oven or crockpot. Cook on a very low flame  until sauce is thickened, and TVP and onions are tender (about 2-2 1/2  hours in a Dutch oven or 4 hours to overnight in crockpot). Remove bay leaf  and cinnamon stick before serving. For authentic Greek meal, serve with a  green salad, nonfat feta cheese (if you can find it--does it exist?), a  crisp round of bread, and red Retsina wine. Or serve over rice or wide  "goulash" noodles, with a green veggie or salad on the side.    Note 1: The amount of liquid depends on how "soupy" you want the end result  to be. 1-1/2 cups of TVP will absorb a major part of 3 cups of liquid, so  if you want more than a small amount of thick gravy, add extra liquid at  the beginning. This recipe, as given, makes a gravy that is thick and rich  but not particularly copious.    Note 2: To peel easily, place in boiling water for 3 minutes, then remove  and cool under cold water. Cut off the root end and squeeze out like  toothpaste. It took me about 10 minutes to peel 18 oz. of onions (3 6-oz.  bags).    This version would serve 3-4 as a main dish if there are also side dishes  to distract the eaters. For a group, Id double: 3 c. TVP, total 6 cups  liquid + the quantity of gravy you want in the finished dish, 12-15 oz. of  tomato sauce or puree. But I would leave the seasonings as you had them.  Three bay leaves is plenty, for example.  Posted to fatfree digest by "Ruth C. Hoffman" <ruthhoff@ix.netcom.com> on  Apr 20, 1998
