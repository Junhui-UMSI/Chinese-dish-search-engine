Wheat-Egg Bread

I just thought Id share a recipe with you.  Its just something I came up  with while tweaking the DAK egg bread recipe (I think this compulsion to  tweak recipes may be inherited!) Ive been using it for sandwich bread this  week.    Sarah Schwartz sgs@bubba.att.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
