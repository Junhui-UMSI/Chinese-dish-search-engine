Apple Up and Down Cake
Vegetable oil, Egg, Lightly packed brown sugar, Nutmeg, Flour, Apple, cored and grated, Baking Powder, Cinnamon, Apples, peeled, cored sliced, Granulated sugar, Butter or margarine, Egg white, Vanilla, Dried currants or raisins, Salt, 2% milk, 
My suggestion:  line a 9 x 9 inch cake pan or large deep dish pie plate  with wax paper.  Melt the butter in a small glass cup in the microwave,  stir in brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spread as evenly as possible over  the wax paper.  Original recipe used 10 inch skillet with ovenproof handle.  Arrange apple slices (or chunks) in butter sauce.    Combine flour, baking powder and salt on a piece of wax paper or in a  mixing bowl.  In second bowl, beat together sugar, egg, egg white, oil,  milk and vanilla. Combine with dry ingredients until just blended. Fold in  currants (or raisins) and grated apple.  Leave the skin on the apple for  extra fiber if you are using a food processor for the grating.    Pour into pan over apple layer.  Bake at 350 F for 25 to 30 minutes or  until cake tester inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Set aside to  let cool.    Carefully invert pan and remove cake to serving plate. Makes 12 servings.
