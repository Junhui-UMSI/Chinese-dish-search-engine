source:The Home Book of Italian cooking    Boil potatoes until tender, drain and mash fine or put though a ricer. Or  allow to cool and grate. On a bread board combine the potatoes, ground meat  or fowl, cheese, nutmeg, flour, egg yolks, and seasonings. Knead until  smooth, and if mixture does not hold together, add 1 more egg yolk. If  dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. Roll dough out on lightly  floured board to 1/2 inch thickness, and cut into 1 inch pieces. Boil in 8  quarts salted water 10 minutes. Drain and serve with desired sauce. Tomato  Sauce or Mushroom sauce is good.    NOTE: These gnocchi may be poached in boiling chicken or meat broth and  served as an accompaniment to soup, if desired.
