Baked Butternut Squash with Apples and Maple Syrup
Fresh Lemon Juice, nutmeg, maple syrup, pure, Dried currants, Butternut squash, butter, green apple, 
Maple syrup was used by the Ojibwa tribe for roasting wild game. Here it  goes into a terrific side dish that includes squash, another Native  American staple.    Preheat oven to 350F. Cook squash in large pot of boiling salted water  until almost tender, about 3 minutes. Drain well. Combine squash, apples  and currants in 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish. Season generously with  nutmeg, salt and pepper. Combine maple syrup, butter and lemon juice in  heavy small saucepan. Whisk over low heat until butter melts. Pour syrup  over squash mixture and toss to coat evenly.    Bake until squash and apples are very tender, stirring occasionally, about  1 hour. Cool 5 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover with foil; chill.  Rewarm covered in 350F. oven about 30 minutes.)         12    Servings    Bon App?tit November 1995    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Mar 05, 1998
