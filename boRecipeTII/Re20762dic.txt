Peel and core apples. Combine margarine,salt,sugar,lemon rind, and  cinnamon. Roll pastry 1/8 inch thick and cut into squares large enough to  cover apples. Place apples on pastry squares and fill each cavity of apple  with sugar mixture. Bring corners of pastry together at top, moisten edges  and pinch together to hold apple in place. Place in greased baking pan and  bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until apples are tender. Serve with  pudding sauce or cream. Serves 6.    Baking powder biscuit dough may be used instead of pastry.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Russellyn Crombie <DJJRS@AOL.COM> on Sep 5, 1997
