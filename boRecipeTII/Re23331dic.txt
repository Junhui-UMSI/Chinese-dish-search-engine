Tuna Tartare-Stuffed Cucumbers
English cucumbers, Toasted pine nuts, Fresh tuna, Prepared wasabi, Juice of 3 limes, Ground black pepper, green onions, Toasted or black sesame, 
Slice the cucumbers into 1 inch rounds.  Using a small spoon, gently scoop  out the seeds, leaving a "bottom" in each piece of cucumber to hold the  filling.  Turn the cucumber cups upside down on paper towels to drain for  about 20 minutes.  Pat the inside of the cucumbers dry with clean, dry  paper towels.    Combine the tuna, lime juice, green onions, and wasabi in a small bowl; mix  well and season with black pepper. Just before filling the cucumbers, add  the pine nuts and sesame seeds to the fish mixture; mix well.    Carefully spoon some filling into each cucumber piece, making a dome of  filling on the top of each piece. Serve chilled.
