Melt the butter  and cream (also yoghurt if you want) in a saucepan until simmering.  Then  pour the cream mixture into the processor whilst working. When the mixture  is welll and truly mixed (making sure to get the cream that has splattered  onto the underside of the lid) separate in to four bowls. Allow to cool  completely and then place in a fridge overnight.    In the morning using a cold spoon form the chocolate mixture into little  truffle shaped balls. This is best done if your hands have been rinsed in  cold water for a while. You now have about 20-30 chocolate truffles.    First if you want rum truffles mix a good quantity of rum (or a few drops  of rum flavouring) into the cream mixture as you melt the butter.    Once you have spooned out the truffles you can roll them in cocoa, chopped  nuts or whatever you want.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
