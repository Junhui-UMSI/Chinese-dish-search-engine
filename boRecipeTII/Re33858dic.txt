Sweet and Sour Salmon (Aka Pickled Salmon)
Bay Leaves, Sugar, raisins, Salmon steak, Vinegar, Onion, salt, 
Place all ingredients in a saucepot. Cover with water. Bring to a boil.  Cover, and cook for 1/2 hour on a small flame. Chill, and enjoy. PS - This  also freezes well, but as with all fish dishes, not for too long! It can  (and should) be made at least one day in advance, and will last for about 5  days in the fridge.
