Whole Wheat Bread From Sponge
White bread flour, Whole-wheat flour, Vegetable oil, Oats, Water, Malted milk, Yeast, Powdered milk, 
Preset machine to WW regular about 15 min before sponge is mixed. Sponge:  Warm water, yeast (sprinkled on top, mixed in) with 4oz bread flour with  about 1/4 cup ww flour.  Pour into machines basket. Put in flour next  followed by rest of ingredents. Rise time for sponge is about 15-20 min.    ?I thought the texture of the white bread was a tad too course. So I tried  making a sponge with the water, about 4oz of flour, 1 Tbs malt and yeast.  Let rise 15min, pour in and add rest of ingredients.  Worked like a charm.  Very light and fluffy with even, small holes.    In moving to a more whole wheat bread, Ive tried to use the same  technique, but with the whole wheat setting.  This has a 30 min rest before  mixing the ingredients and lets the bread rise/rest three times.  I let the  sponge rise 15 min by choosing the WW setting ahead of time.?    >From: mark.stephens@gsfc.nasa.gov (mark stephens)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
