by Susan Fowler Volland, Food Stylist and Food Editor    Whole, crispy fried Walla Walla Sweet Onions cut to resemble flowers are a  popular treat at fairs and festivals throughout Washington State. The  "petals" of the onion are simply torn off and dipped in zesty barbecue  sauce. Try this simple, reduced-fat version which can easily be made in the  oven. The lovely presentation and combination of flavors make a memorable  plate, especially when paired with good company and a tall, cool lemonade.    Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Lightly grease a large baking or roasting  pan. Peel the Walla Walla Sweet Onions, cut the bottom level, but leave the  core intact. To make the flower design, begin as if you are going to cut  the onion in half, from top to bottom, but stop cutting 1/2 inch from the  core. Cut the onion this way 5 times to form ten sections or "petals."  Carefully loosen the petals slightly by rapping the onion lightly on the  work surface, and loosening them with your fingers. Remember that the  flower will bloom more as it cooks.    Place the flour, salt, pepper, oregano, paprika and mustard in a small  paper bag. Spray the onions with cooking spray to lightly coat each petal.  Put one of the onions in the bag and gently shake to coat. Remove the onion  and pat off the excess flour mixture. Place in a prepared pan and repeat  with the other onion. Spray the coated onions lightly again with cooking  spray to aid in browning.    Bake the onions in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until tender.  Serve the onion flowers hot, with your favorite barbecue sauce as a dip.
