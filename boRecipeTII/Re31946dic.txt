Taco Bells Cinnamon Twists (Angel Wings)
Almond extract, Flour, Salt, Sugar, Eggs yolks, Sour cream, 
Combine all, adding each item as listed, and enough more flour so that  dough is no longer sticky, but still very soft. Roll small portions of  dough at a time to paper-thin. Use lightly floured working surface. Cut  into strips 2"x5" and arrange in single layer on oiled cookie sheets. Bring  enough oil to 400~ in deep heavy saucepan, at least 3" deep. As you drop  the dough into oil, make a 1" slit down center of each and draw the  opposite ends of the strip through the slit. Theyll fall to the bottom but  will surface in a few seconds as they brown, about 2 minutes. Lift out with  tongs and drop into large grocery sack containing about 1 LB of 10-X  powdered sugar.
