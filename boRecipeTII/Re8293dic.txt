Note: No raita recipe provided (but see any Indian cookbook) - HB    Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a bowl and rinse with cold  running water until water runs clear, to remove excess starch.    Heat 1/4 cup of the clarified butter in a saucepan over mediumhigh heat.  Saute onions until brown.    At same time, heat remaining 1/4 cup clarified butter in a large skillet  over moderate heat. Fry potatoes until golden and add sauteed onions. Add  garlic and ginger, and cook just long enough to release their aromas.  Remove from heat and add cumin, turmeric, coriander, and pepper flakes.  Return pan to moderate heat and cook 12 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir  in tomatoes, water, and salt. Simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are soft,  about 15 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and cook until peas are heated  through. Adjust seasonings and serve immediately with basmati rice and  assorted chutneys and raita.
