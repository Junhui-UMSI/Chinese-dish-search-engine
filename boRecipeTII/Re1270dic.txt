In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in one cup of warm water to proof.  In a large mixing bowl, sift white flour and rye flour together until well  combined.    Place remaining warm water, molasses, shortening, salt, and cocoa powder in  separate bowl and mix well. Add yeast mixture and 4 cups of the mixed  flours. Mix until a sponge-like dough forms. Add remaining flour and mix  until all flour is veru well incorporated into the dough.    Turn out the dough onto a well-floured surface and hand knead until the  dough is smooth and silky, about 10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl  and turn, then cover with a clean towel and leave to rise until doubled in  bulk, usually at least an hour.    Punch dough down and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Divide dough into  loaves and place in greased loaf pans, cover, and let rise while oven heats  to 350-F degrees.    Bake loaves in the center of oven until done, about 35 minutes. Remove from  pans and rub tops of loaves with butter (optional).
