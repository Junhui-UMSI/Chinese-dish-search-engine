Aspic Jelly:  ============         Put the water, bones, beef, vegetables and spices in a pot and simmer  for 2 hours.  Skim the fat off the surface and strain the liquid through a  chinois.  Add the port and cognac.         Check the consistency of the aspic by pouring 1/2 ounce on a plate and  refrigerating for 10 minutes.  If the aspic is not hard enough, add 2-3  tablespoons of unflavored gelatin.
