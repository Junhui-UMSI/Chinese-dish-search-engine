Fresh Chives, Tarragon Wine Vinegar, Mangoes, Chicken Stock, Cornmeal, Shallots, Snapper Fillets, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Orange Juice Concentrate, Salt, Tequila, 
1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Dip each fish fillet in the cornmeal and dust  off excess.    2. In an oven-proof saute pan large enough to hold the fillets without  crowding, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Add the snapper and saute for  1 minute. Turn fillet over; then transfer the pan to the oven, and bake the  fish for 4 to 5 minutes. the fish should then be opaque, not translucent.    3. While the fish is baking, in a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive  oil. Sweat the shallots and when translucent, add the vinegar. Let reduce  until almost dry. Add the tequila and let reduce by half. Stir in the  stock, orange juice concentrate and mangoes. Let simmer for 5 minutes.    4. Pour into blender and process until very smooth. Add the chives and  adjust the seasoning.    5. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of sauce onto each dinner plate and set the  cooked fish in the center. For a beautiful presentation, decorate with  diced mango, or with purple basil and chives.
