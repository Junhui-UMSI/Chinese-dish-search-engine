Turkey Soup From Loren Martin
Whole Bay Leaves, Wild rice, Celery, salt and pepper, Over from 20 pound bird, Chopped fresh parsley, Meaty turkey carcass, left, Chopped carrots, Peppercorns, Whole dried Tarragon, Water or broth, Large onion, quartered, Garlic, Sweet basil, dried, 
Take the meat off the turkey carcass as soon as dinner is over and toss the  carcass into a large pot.  Add all of the spices and water (or broth). I  usually also add a cup or two of white wine. Bring to a boil and then  reduce heat to simmer for an additional 6-8 hours. Cool the soup and  strain. If you wish, skim any fat from the broth at this point. Return the  broth to the pot, add large pieces of cooked turkey and any coarsely  chopped fresh vegetables you wish to the mixture; add wild rice, barley, or  whatever legume you wish, and simmer (covered) until the rice is done and  the vegetables are crisp-tender. Enjoy......this also freezes well.
