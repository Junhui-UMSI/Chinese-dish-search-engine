Pre-heat oven to 300-F degrees. Spray a low-fat, non-stick cooking oil onto  an 8 1/2 x 11-inch baking dish. Mash graham crackers into crumbs in a food  processor or blender and prepare 2 cups of crumbs. Transfer to a small bowl  and add cocoa and salt, mix well and set aside.    In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, egg white and both sugars. Beat with  a mixer at high speed until thickened, about 2-minutes. Blend in coffee and  vanilla. Gently fold in dates, chocolate chips and reserved cracker crumb  mixture. Pour batter into prepared baking dish, shake gently to spread  evenly.    Bake brownies for 25 to 30-minutes, or until the top springs back when  gently touched. Let cool completely in the pan or on a wire rack before  cutting to serve. Store in an airtight container for up to 3-days or freeze  for up to 3-months.
