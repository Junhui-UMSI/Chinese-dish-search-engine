Preheat oven to 400F. Cut the squash in half, remove the seeds and pulp,  brush the surface with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place the  halves, cut side down, on a baking sheet, and bake until the skin is  puckered and the squash is soft, about an hour. Remove it from the oven,  let it cool enough to handle easily, then scoop out the flesh. Pass the  flesh through a food mill or chinoise to smooth out the texture. There  should be about 1-1/2 cups. [Freeze any extra.]    While the squash is baking, prepare the tart dough. Partially bake it and  set aside.    Trim the leeks, quarter them lengthwise, slice them into 1/4-inch squares  [slices work too] and wash them well. Melt the butter in a skillet, add the  leeks, and cook over medium-high heat until they are tender, 7 to 10  minutes. Add a little water after the first 3 or 4 minutes to help the  cooking and keep them from burning. Season with salt.    Beat the eggs in a bowl with the creme fraiche or cream, milk, and squash.  Stir in the leeks, grated cheese, and herbs. Season to taste with salt,  pepper, and a few scrapings of nutmeg.    Set the oven heat at 375F. Pour the batter into the tart shell and bake in  the center of the oven until it is firm and flecked with spots of brown  from the melted cheese, about 45 to 50 minutes.    Remove the tart from the oven, let it ret for 5 to 10 minutes, and serve it  on a platter.    Makes one 9- or 10-inch tart. [10-inch quiche dish]    Notes: Can prepare squash ahead. After that, actual kitchen work is not too  much. Would be nice for company.    Recipe By     : The Greens Cookbook    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
