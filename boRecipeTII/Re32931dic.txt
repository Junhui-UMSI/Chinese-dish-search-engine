Sweet Spiced Nuts
Nuts, Orange juice, Egg white, Ground cloves, Cinnamon, Sugar, Nutmeg, Orange Peel, 
The following is a great nibblie recipe; the nuts come out incredibly light  and crispy. Its from The Uncommon Gourmet, with some slight modifications  by me.    preheat oven to 300; grease a cookie sheet. put the nuts in a large bowl.  combine everything else really well; pour over nuts and toss well. spread  nuts out in a single layer on the cookie sheet; bake 30 min, stirring every  10 min. Put the nuts on a plate to cool; they keep for 2 weeks in an  airtight container.    Posted to Kitmailbox Digest  by Dreame4608 on .
