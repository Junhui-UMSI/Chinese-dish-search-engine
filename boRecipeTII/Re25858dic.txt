Soak the dried cod in cold water for about 24 hours, or until completely  moistened.  Change the water several times; drain thoroughly.    Put the cod into a saucepan with cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil,  reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes or until fish is tender. Drain; skin  and bone the fish.  Flake with a fork into large pieces.    Saute the onions in half the butter until they are tender and golden. Add  the barlic.  Boil the unpeeled potatoes in salted water.  Once tender,  remove from the heat, refresh in running cold water; then remove skins.  Drain and slice into 1/4" pieces.    Preheat oven to 350 F.  Grease a 1-1/2 quart casserole with the remaining  butter.  Arrange a layer of half the potatoes, then half the cod, then half  the onions.  Sprinkle with a little pepper, and repeat layering. Sprinkle  bread crumbs over the top layer.  Bake for 15 minutes, or until heated  through and lightly browned.  Before serving, garnish with olives and eggs,  and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with wine vinegar and oil in cruets and  pepper on the side.                                           -- The Nero Wolfe Cookbook                                            per Sam Waring    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
