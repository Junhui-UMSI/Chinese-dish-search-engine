For crust:  Preheat oven to 325=F8F.  Lightly butter 9-inch diameter  springform pan with 2 3/4-inch-high sides.  Finely grind graham crackers,  pecans and sugar in processor.  Add butter and blend, using on/off turns.  Press crumbs onto bottom and 2 inches up sides of prepared pan. Refrigerate       20    minutes.    For filling:  Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar in large  bowl until smooth.  Whisk eggs, Baileys and vanilla in medium bowl until  just blended.  Beat egg mixture into cream cheese mixture. Finely chop  white chocolate in processor using on/off turns. Add to cream cheese  mixture.    Transfer filling to crust-lined pan.  Bake until edges of filling are  puffed and dry looking and center is just set, about 50 minutes. Cool on  rack.    For topping:  Mix sour cream and powdered sugar in small bowl. Spread  topping onto cooled cake.  Refrigerate until well chilled, about 6 hours.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.)    Sprinkle grated chocolate over cake.  Place pecans around edge and serve.    Note: Ive fixed the cake with and without the topping, and I prefer it  without the topping. As a suggestion, prepare the topping, but serve it on  the side.
