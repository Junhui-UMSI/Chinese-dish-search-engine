Udon Noodles with Asparagus and Cashews (t)
Cornstarch, Fresh pea pods, Whole wheat udon noodles, Garlic, Dry sherry, Peanut oil, Asparagus, Cashews, Tamari soy sauce, 
PRE-STEAMING: The original recipe used raw vegetables in the stir fry and  added water to the wok until the vegetables were bright green. Instead of  sweat-frying the vegetables, steam them for 3 minutes with a piece of  fresh ginger the size of a small table grape. Shock the vegetables in ice  water, drain and towel dry    Bring a pot of water to the boil. Cook the noodles; they will take about 5  to 6 minutes.    Meanwhile, heat oil in wok over high heat. Fry the garlic until the oil is  aromatic (1 minute or less). Reduce heat. Add the cashews and stir briefly.  Add the steamed vegetables and stir fry to heat through. Clear a space in  the center of the wok. Pour in the cornstarch mixture. (see tip) The  alcohol will burn about as quickly as it takes to drain the noodles; shake  off some of the water but not all; add wet noodles to the wok; gently stir  to form sauce. Serve at once.    TIP: Add a little pasta water to the wok to prevent the sauce from burning  while draining the noodles. It helps to have a assistant.    SPRINGTIME: These hearty noodles were delicious with the light sauce,  cashews, sweet pea pods and young asparagus. A winner.
