Herb and Vegetable Soup
olive oil, Onion, Garlic, Sherry, Carrots, Potatoes, celery, Shallots, Red bell peppers, fresh basil, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, fresh oregano, Chopped parsley, ziti, Hot pepper sauce, Salt and black pepper, Herb sprigs, Chicken stock or vegetable, 
In a very large stockpot, heat olive oil until very hot. Add onion and  garlic and saute until you can smell the aroma. Add sherry and boil over  high heat until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add carrots, potatoes,  celery, and stock and cook over medium heat until the potatoes are barely  cooked, 10 to 15 minutes. Add shallots, peppers, basil, thyme, rosemary,  oregano, and parsley, and simmer just until the potatoes are fork-tender.    Add the pasta, then season with cayenne sauce, salt, and pepper. Heat just  until the pasta is warmed through. Serve soup hot, topped with a fresh herb  sprig and freshly ground black pepper.    "This soup is packed full of flavor and low in fat. When I make a double  batch of this soup, I place the pasta in the individual serving bowls and  pour the hot soup over it, so that the pasta doesnt get overcooked when I  reheat the soup later."    >MC formatted by Brenda Adams and MC_Buster >Nutrition links pat Hanneman  (335cals, 5g fat, 14%cff) >to elf-ideas SOUPS 11/19/98    ADDRESS CHANGE 1998: old http://www.pacificharbor.com/caprial/ new  http://www.caprial.com/    Recipe by: Cooking with Caprial! http://www.caprial.com/    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by kitpath@earthlink.net on Nov 19, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
