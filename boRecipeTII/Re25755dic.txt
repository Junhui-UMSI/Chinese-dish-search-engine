In a small bowl, combine the sour cream; egg yolks and lemon juice.  Blend the sour cream mixture into the flour mixture. Knead together to form  a smooth dough. Place the dough on plastic wrap and pat it into a 6 x  8-inch rectangle. Wrap and refrigerate 2 hours, or overnight.    filling: Whip the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually whip in the  sugar to form a meringue. Whip until the meringue holds soft peaks. Fold in  the remaining ingredients. Dust a rolling pin and the counter with flour.  Roll the chilled dough out into a thin (1/8-inch maximum) rectangle on the  floured counter. Trim the edges so the rectangle measures 24 x 15-inches.  Cut the dough into 3-inch squares and dust with confectioners sugar. Place  a rounded teaspoon of the filling in the center of each dough square. With  a tiny bit of water, dampen two opposite corner. Fold the two opposite  corners over each other and press the center together lightly.
