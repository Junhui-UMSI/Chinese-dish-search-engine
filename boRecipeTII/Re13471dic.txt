FOR THE SAUCE, Garlic, Dried Oregano, Red potatoes, Whole allspice, Masa, Water, Cloves, Tomatoes, Fresh cilantro stems, FOR THE VEGETABLES, Cumin seed, Guajillo chiles, Nopales, Vegetable oil, corn, fresh, Carrots, 
SAUCE: Heat a griddle or heavy skillet to very hot and cook the chiles for  10 seconds to soften. Rinse the chiles and place in a saucepan with 2 cups  of water. Bring to a boil and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Reserving  the liquid, place the chiles in a blender with the allspice, cloves, cumin,  oregano, and garlic. Blend with the top slightly off and protected by a  kitchen towel or the heat will blow the top off during blending. Add the  chile cooking water and blend again. Add the tomatoes and blend again.    Heat the oil in a saucepan. Press a third of the sauce through a strainer  into the hot oil and cook, stirring. Press another third, then the  remainder, adding a little hot water if necessary to get the sauce through.  Reduce the heat and simmer the smoothed sauce for 10 minutes.    VEGETABLES: Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add the potatoes and carrots  and cook for 10 minutes. Add the nopales, corn, and cilantro and boil for  an additional 5 minutes. In a bowl, mix the 3 cups of water with the masa,  a little at a time until its all incorporated. Slowly pour the thinned  masa into the boiling vegetable-chile water and stir well. Add 3 more cups  of water. Cook for 10 minutes to thicken. Combine the sauce and vegetables.  Serve in wide, shallow bowls accompanied by warm tortillas.
