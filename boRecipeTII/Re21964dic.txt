I have a book called "Cooking Behind the Fence: Recipes and Recollections  from the Oak Ridge 43 Club." (c1992) It features recipes from the 40s  when Oak Ridge, TN was fenced and people had to have a security clearance  to get in. I picked one recipe for you. If you have any particular kind of  recipe you would be interested in let me know. The person who supplied this  recipe remembers that there was only one grocery store in the area back in  1943 and she remembers waiting in line for 2 hours to buy soap powder.
