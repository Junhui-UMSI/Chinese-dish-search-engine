Texas prison chili got its good reputation from Sheriff Smoot Schmids  truly fine recipe for the Dallas County Jail. Recently, however, a Texas  prison chili contest was won by Huntsville Penitentiary with a godawful  recipe that called for twice as much cumin as chili powder and "2 handfuls"  of monosodium glutamate. In Texas, this is called crime deterrence.    Dallas County Chili    Fry suet in a heavy kettle. Add meat, finely diced garlic and seasonings;  cover. Cook slowly for four hours, stirring occasionally. Add the water and  continue cooking until the chili has thickened slightly, about one hour.  Serve plain or mixed with equal portion of cooked pink or red beans.
