Add the won ton strips in batches and  fry, turning, until crisp and golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper  towels; drain well.    In a large bowl, combine the mixed greens, chicken, bean sprouts, yellow  pepper and cucumber.    In a medium bowl, whisk together the lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar,  chiles, nutmeg, lemon grass, ginger, mint and basil. Add the dressing to  the salad and toss well.
