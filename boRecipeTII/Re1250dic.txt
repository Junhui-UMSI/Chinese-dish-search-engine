Curried Celery Soup (High Fiber)
Curry powder, Potatoes, Vegetable stock, Bouquet garnish, fresh mixed herbs, Salt, Celery (seeds and leaves), olive oil, Onion, Leek, Celery, 
Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add onion, leek, and celery, cover and cook  gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Add the curry powder and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Add the potatoes, broth and bouquet garni, cover and bring to a boil.  Simmer for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.    Remove and discard the bouquet garni.    You may want to set the soup aside to cool slightly before pureeing in a  food processor or blender. If you are using an immersion blender, the soup  does not need to cool. Puree until smooth.    Add the mixed herbs, season to taste and process briefly. Return to the  saucepan and reheat gently until piping hot. Ladle into soup bowls and  garnish each with a sprinkling of celery seeds and some celery leaves.    VARIATION: use celeriac and sweet potatoes in place of celery and standard  potatoes.

TIP: The smaller the chop, the  faster the vegetables cook. This soup doesnt improve that much with  prolonged simmering. )    Recipe by: HIGH FIBER COOKBOOK - Anne Sheasby*    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by kitpath@earthlink.net on Nov 20, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
