Chef: Eugenia Theodosopoulos    Restaurant: LAubergine    For filling, in one or two large frying pans over medium-high heat, add  extra virgin olive oil and onions. Stir to coat onions with olive oil. Cook  on medium-high heat for about 10 minutes and then reduce to medium-low and  cook for about 20 minutes. Add garlic, sugar, salt, pepper and vinegar.  Cook for 10 more minutes and then add tomato puree. Stir well and cook for  20 more minutes until very wilted and soft. Taste for seasonings; should be  sweet and sour. Set aside to cool.    NOTE: Filling may be prepared 1 to 2 days ahead.    For dough, mix water and yeast in electric mixer bowl. Let rest for 10  minutes. Add flour and olive oil. Mix on medium speed with dough hook for  about 2 minutes. Add salt and mix for 2 more minutes. Remove from pan, mix  for about 1 minute until satiny. Oil plastic or glass bowl, turn dough  around to coat. Cover with towel and let raise at room temperature until  doubled in volume. In 16-inch x 12-inch pan (or 2 round pans), spread out  dough to cover bottom of pan to even thickness. Spread onion mixture over.  Bake in preheated 425-degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until crust is  browned. Allow to rest for 15 minutes before cutting.    Best served at room temperature. Cut into squares (can remove outer crusts  if like) and decorate with capers, anchovies or olives.    Makes about 40 squares for hors doeuvres.
