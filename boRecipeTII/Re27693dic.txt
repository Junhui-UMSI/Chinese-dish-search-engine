The Greatest Glazed Nuts
White Karo syrup, Water, Pecans or almonds or cashews, Vegetable oil, 
Mix all together in pan and bake at 350 degrees for about 30 to 40 minutes.  Stir and mix the nuts and liquid every 10 minutes or so to keep nuts  covered. When the whole mixture of liquids is gone and there are little  bubbles all over the nuts, remove from oven. Spread onto another tray.  Shake heavy rock salt over at once so it will stick to nuts before they get  crisp. Dont use table salt. Time may vary amount to temperature.
