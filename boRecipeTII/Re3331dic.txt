Peel, halve, and core the pears. Rub each half with lemon juice. In a  heavy, nonreactive saucepan, bring the Zinfandel, vanilla bean,  peppercorns, cinnamon stick, and sugar to a boil.

Garnish with the  mint sprigs. Serve immediately.    Recipe by: MAILING LIST 1995    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 442 by ctlindab@mail1.nai.net on  Jan 3, 1998
