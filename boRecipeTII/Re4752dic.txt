Preheat an oven to 350 degrees.    Reduce the orange juice to 1 1/2 cups in a small heavy saucepan with the  sugar, vanilla bean, bay leaves and salt. Let cool.    Unwrap and unroll the thawed phyllo dough. Remove 3 sheets and cut in half  to make 6. Reroll the remainder and wrap tightly. Return to the  refrigerator for another use. Brush each half sheet of phyllo with the  melted butter on both sides and sprinkle with sugar. With both hands  crumple the sheet to about the size of a squash ball.

In each of 6 bowls, place 1 phyllo crumple, 6 clementine sections in a ring  next to it and pour 1/4 cup of the flavored orange syrup over the fruit.  Place a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on each ring of fruit. Garnish  with a mint sprig and serve.
