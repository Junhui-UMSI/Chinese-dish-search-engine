Sushi Rice #2
Short grain rice, Water, Rice vinegar, -(up to), Sugar, Salt, 
Here is my recipe for sushi rice - from the archives.  There are several  other recipes there with detailed instructions for making the rice (and all  other aspects of sushi).  Its very easy and you dont need lots of special  ingredients - the rice just needs to be a short grain variety.    The only  "exotic" ingredient is nori - the thin seaweed wrapper that contains the  sushi. These are available in many well-stocked American groceries (at  least in California) and, of course, in Asian groceries.      Cook rice till done (bring to boil, then simmer, covered for 20 minutes).  While rice is cooking, combine in a small saucepan: 3 tablespoons rice  vinegar, 1-2 tablespoons sugar (depending on how sweet you like the rice),  and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat till sugar is completely dissolved.      When the rice is done and still hot, put it in a large bowl.  Slowly  drizzle the vinegar mixture over the rice while gently stirring it. Once  youve poured in the vinegar (and have a free hand), fan the rice with some  newspaper while stirring to help it cool more quickly. Keep stirring and  fanning till the rice is at room temperature. It should be perfect  sushi-stickiness.      To make sushi, place a seaweed wrapper on a bamboo mat or some foil.  Wet  your hands thoroughly, and pat rice onto the seaweed.  The rice should be  about 1/2" thick.  Cover the wrapper completely except for a little space  at the ends. Add your fillings, and roll, pressing tightly so that it  maintains a cylindrical shape. Cut in 1" rounds and ENJOY!
