Heat the oil in a nonreactive large saucepan over medium heat. Add the  garlic, stir, remove the pan from the heat, and allow the hot oil to turn  the garlic pale gold, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, capers,  olives, red pepper flakes, basil, oregano, and black pepper, return to  medium-low heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste the sauce and add salt  and pepper if needed. Reduce the heat to very low. Cook the spaghetti in  plenty of well-salted, boiling water until al dente; drain. Toss the  spaghetti with the sauce, sprinkle on the fresh parsley, and serve.
