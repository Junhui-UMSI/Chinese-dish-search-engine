Xxxx-Hot Carribbean Habanero Hot Sauce
-(up to), Lime juice, Cinnamon, Habanero peppers, Garlic, Onions, Mustard, Papayas, Vinegar, Salt, Sugar, smoked Jalapenos , 
~Hydrate the dried jalapenos.  Retain approx. 1/4 cup of the liquid.    ~Chop all solids.  Throw into blender with liquid ingredients.  "Liquify" for a good, long time ... goal here is to do away with all  chunks of anything. Note: I left seeds & "flesh" of peppers intact.  For a more mild sauce, you may want to extract these    ~Once mixture is very smooth, cook over very low heat for 30-60  minutes. Stir often.  During this time, taste (as much as you are  able to), and add addl amounts of desired ingredients until you  acheive the taste you desire. Goal is to come up with a sauce that is  sweet at first taste, then leaves a healthy amount of pain as the  taste fades away.    ~Remove from heat, cool 30-60 minutes.    ~Strain mixture to extract liquid, leave behind seeds, pulp, etc.  This will take a while - be patient.    ~Store extracted liquid in an air-tight container, or in a sealed  bottle. Time will increase heat & taste.    Note:  Like many cooks, I created this with no precise measurements  ... it was a total experiment & actually turned out very well (though  very painful). Please feel free to alter/experiment.
