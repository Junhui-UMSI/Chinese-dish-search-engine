Cover. Let rise in warm place until double, about 20 minutes.  Scald milk, stir in margarine, sugar and salt. Cool to lukewarm. Beat eggs  with lemon extract until fluffy. Stir in milk mixture. Add 2 cups flour,  beat until smooth. Stir in yeast mixture. Stir in enough flour, about 1 1/2  cups, to make a soft dough. Turn onto lightly floured surface. Knead until  smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Add more flour, if necessary, to  prevent sticking. Place in oiled bowl, turning to oil top of bread. Cover,  let rise in warm place until double, about 2 hours. Punch down, let rise  again until double, about 1 hour. Divide and shape into 2 loaves. Place in  greased loaf or round pans. Let rise until almost double, about 1 hour.  Brush beaten egg on top. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Cool out of  pans on racks.
