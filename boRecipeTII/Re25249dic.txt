Tonys Poppers
Jalapeno chiles, Cheddar cheese, 
Tony Mordeszewski (amordesz@ingr.com) and his wife, Diana, made some great  Jalapeno poppers at the First Annual North Alabama HotLuck in August by  using the following recipe:    Slice some Cheddar brick cheese into logs that will fit into a cored out  Jalapeno. Place them on a plate in the freezer for later.    Take a fresh Jalapeno and slice it almost in half the long way so the  halves are still attached at the stem end. Hold the halves open like an  alligators mouth and with a potato peeler core out the seeds and membrane.  Be careful not to let the halves split apart.    Mix up the batter.   I use graham flour and water.  Mix to the consistency  thin or thick depending on how much breading you like on the pepper. You  can add any spices you like to the batter. We use none.    Preheat the deep fryer to 400 degrees. The hotter the oil the browner the  skin.    Pull the cheese from the freezer and insert a frozen piece into the pepper.  Run a toothpick on an angle through the 2 halves on the open ends to keep  the whole thing together. Drop the pepper in the batter and get it coated  good, especially at the seams.    Drop the pepper in the oil and leave it in there until the cheese starts  dancing out of the pepper, or until you think it is just about to.    Drain on paper towels and use cocktail sauce for dipping, being careful to  remove toothpick before dipping.    Chase with a good shot of Tequila.
