Pumpkin and Mussel Soup
Garlic, Pumpkin - (2 lbs); seeds, Heavy cream, White wine, Finely-chopped fresh chives, Vegetable oil, Black Pepper, Salt, olive oil, Finely-chopped onion, Vegetable or chicken stock, Mussels; scrubbed, debearded, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    First cook your pumpkin. In a bowl gently toss together the pumpkin cubes  and a little vegetable oil. Place pumpkin on a baking sheet and roast for       15    minutes or until tender.    Meanwhile, heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a large stock pot, add the  onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the white  wine and mussels, cover and steam for 4 minutes or so until the mussels  just begin to open. Using a slotted spoon, remove only the mussels and  allow them to cool. Then add the stock to the soup pot along with the  roasted pumpkin. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 15  minutes.    Meanwhile, remove the mussels from their shells and reserve all the juices.  Using a hand held blender, or transfer mixture to a blender and then return  to the stock pot, puree the soup base. Now add the cream, chives, mussels,  and their juices to the puree. Season to taste with salt and pepper and  ladle into soup bowls.
