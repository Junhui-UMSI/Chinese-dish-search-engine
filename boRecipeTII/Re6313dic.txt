The egg plant used should, ideally, be the Thai cariant known as makheua  pro - this is greenish white, and has fruits that resemble green golfballs.  If you cannot find it, then use a western (purple) eggplant/aubergine, cut  into small dice. Note that the cooking time will vary, and you should not  cook the aubergine longer than necesary (they should still be firm and have  a slight resistance to the bite).    METHOD:    briefly sautee the garlic in a little hot oil in a wok until it starts to  turn golden brown, then add the curry paste and stir fry until aromatic.  Reduce the heat to medium low, and add the squid, mixing and stirring  briefly, then add the remaining ingredients (except the basil), and stir  briskly until the squid is just cooked through (it cooks quickly - do not  overcook or it will go rubbery).    Transfer to a serving plate, garnish and serve with steamed rice.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #060    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
