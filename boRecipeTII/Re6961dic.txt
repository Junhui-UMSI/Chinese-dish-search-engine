Poormans Shake N Bake
Curry, Chili powder, Flour, Season pepper, Sweet basil, Bran flake cereal, Taco seasoning, Parsley flakes, Cayenne pepper, Garlic powder, Onion powder, Oregano, 
Mix all together and use for coating any and all types of meat. I use a  large size ZipLoc and just keep it in the freezer. You can add more of the  cayenne and chili powder if you so desire. I usually just throw in what I  have at the time I make it so it is never the same twice. It is a great all  round coating.
