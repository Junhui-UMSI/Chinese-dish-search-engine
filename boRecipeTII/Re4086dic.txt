Pepperoni and Cheese Loaf
Dried Oregano, Mozzarella cheese, shredded, Sliced pepperoni, Frozen bread dough, Grated Parmesan cheese, Egg, 
Thaw dough and allow to rise according to package directions.    Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Roll/press dough into a  large rectangle (approximately 15" by 12"). Combine egg and Parmesan  cheese, stirring well; spread egg mixture over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch  margin at edges. Layer pepperoni and mozzarella cheese over egg mixture,  and sprinkle with oregano.    Roll up dough jellyroll fashion. Seal edges, and fold under ends. Transfer  loaf, seam side down, to an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375? for 30  minutes. Cut into slices to serve.    Cindys Notes: I usually use a little less pepperoni -- maybe 6 ounces. I  always used to have a "blow out" in the loaf as it baked -- the cheese  would break through the dough and run out onto the baking sheet. Ive  started making slits through the top of the loaf. This seems to reduce how  often it blows out.    NOTES : DarlingCL@aol.com    Recipe by: 1982 Southern Living Annual Recipes    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #464 by DarlingCL@aol.com on Feb 1, 1997.
