Thought Id pass this recipe along since we just made it and I can vouch  how good it is first hand (and full stomached). This is a modification to a  recipe Cindi has made for years. (We added bell peppers and onions and used  smoked brisket).  I used several bags of sliced brisket from the freezer to  clean it out a little in preparation for the next one Ill be doing soon.    In a large sauce pan or dutch oven,  saute bell pepper, onion,  and green  chiles with garlic powder in about 3 tablespoons of oil.  When onions and  bell peppers are tender, add brisket, salsa, and gravy.  Cook over low heat  for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Sample often.    Spoon meat mixture and  cheese onto flour tortilla and wrap.  Theres lots  of variations possible on this but the important ingredient for the special  flavor is the Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.  These burritos can be frozen  and  are great when re-heated.    Contributor:  Cindi & Rodney (Vicksburg, MS)    Posted to bbq-digest by "Cindi" <rlcz@netdoor.com> on Sep 20, 1998
