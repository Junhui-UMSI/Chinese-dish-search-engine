White Trash
golden graham cereal, Roasted mixed nuts & pecans, Chocolate morsels, Watkins vanilla, Powdered sugar, Margarine, Peanut butter, golden raisins, 
Mix dry ingredients.  In a sauce pan, slowly melt margerine, chocolate  morsels, and peanut butter, stirring constantly. DO NOT BOIL. Add vanilla  and cool. Pour sauce (about 1/3 at the time) over cereal mix and mix until  well coated.  Pour into a large grocery bag and shake with the powdered  sugar (about 1/2 box at the time). Store in tightly covered container. This  makes enough for a crowd and is nice for gifts. It is a sweet version of  the popular Nuts and Bolts.   This was given to us Christmas 1991 by Mary Alice King of Dixie Union,  Georgia.
