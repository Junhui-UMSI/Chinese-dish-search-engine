1. Dip the milanesas in the whipped eggs and in the bread crumbs with salt  and pepper. Shake of the excess bread. Fry the milanesas until they are  slightly golden.    2. Soak up the excess grease with a napkin or paper towel. (The milanesas  may be served with mashed potatoes or with boiled cabbage. To make the  plate a little heartier, the milanesa may be served with cheese or with  ham. )  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 218 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Nov 07, 1997
