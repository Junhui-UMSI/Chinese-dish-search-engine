To make dough: In a large bowl combine flour, salt, lard, and butter. Mix  lightly with your fingers until the dough forms pea-sized pieces. Stir in  iced water and lightly knead until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap  and refrigerate for 1-2 hours or overnight.    To make filling: Heat olive oil in a frying pan and add diced onion, salt  and pepper. Cook over moderate heat until onions are soft and begin to turn  lightly golden. Add chard stems and cook a minute or two then add the chard  leaves and cook until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.  Mix cooled cooked chard with grated cheeses and taste, adjust seasoning.:    To assemble empanadas: On a lightly floured board, roll the dough out to  1/8 inch thickness and cut 6 circles about 5 inches each or 12 smaller  circles. Place filling onto half of circle of dough leaving a border and  wet the edges of the dough with the egg wash, then fold the dough over to  enclose the filling. Seal the edges by pressing the top to the bottom with  the tines of a fork. Chill at least 30 minutes before baking.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place empanadas on a baking sheet and brush  tops with egg wash and sprinkle with freshly cracked pepper. With a sharp  knife, cut small slits in the top of each empanada to allow steam to  escape. Bake 30 minutes or until dough is golden. Transfer to a cooling  rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.
