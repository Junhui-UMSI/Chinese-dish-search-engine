Acorn Squash Seeds
Margarine, Salt to taste, Acorn squash, 
NOTE:  Acorn squash seeds taste similar to pumpkin seeds except that the  hulls on the squash seed are smaller.  Therefore they are less dry tasting  than pumpkin seeds and dont get caught in your throat as easily.    Cut uncooked squash in half and scoop out seeds.  Clean pulp and strings  off the seeds in a collander under running water.  Set the seeds on a towel  to dry.  Preheat oven to 350 deg.  The seeds in a small bowl. Either melt  margarine and pour onto seeds or put solid margarine into bowl and mix with  you hands (my preferred method).  Spread seeds evenly on a cookie sheet.  Place in oven and cook 10 min. or until just starts to turn brown.                       Recipe by:  James M.
