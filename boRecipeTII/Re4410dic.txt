Pesach Noodles
Salt, A little chopped parsley, Potato flour, Water, Eggs, 
The following are two recipes for Pesach Noodles from a small cookbook  printed by the Young Israel of Kfar Ganim in Petach Tikva, Israel. I have  made the first one and it is good.    Beat eggs with water, then add rest of ingredients. Heat frying pan with  very little oil. Fry a small amount of batter at a time, on both sides like  an omelette. Pile a number of omelettes on top of each other. Roll up and  cut into thin strips. Add to soup before serving.
