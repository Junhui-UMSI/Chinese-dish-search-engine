Recipe By : Copyright ? 1995 by Heidi Rabel    If you are using fermented beans, prepare them ahead. Rinse them several  times, then soak them in water for 3 hours (or overnight). Rinse again.  Puree with 1 cup stock.    In a large saucepan on medium heat, cook onion in oil until translucent  (about 6 - 8 minutes). Add garlic, cumin seed, and chopped pepper, and cook  5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining stock, 1/2 cup cilantro,  cocoa powder, cumin, chili powder, beans, tomatoes, and black bean sauce or  pureed fermented bean mixture. Simmer about 5 minutes. Add lime zest.  Simmer for 15 minutes more, then add lime juice and correct seasoning. The  longer it simmers the thicker it will become. Add the remaining 1/2 cup  cilantro about 3 minutes before serving.    NOTES : Soak black beans in water for 3 hours and then rinse. Fermented  black beans (packaged in small plastic bags), are available in Asian  markets. Their musky flavor cannot be duplicated, but they are salt-cured,  so soaking is essential. The Chinese black bean sauce found in most grocery  stores is made with these beans. However, it often contains lots of garlic,  so decrease the garlic by 1 tsp. To serve, ladle into warmed bowls and  garnish with Salsa and sour cream, yogurt, or cilantro Creme Fraiche.  Yield: 6 servings.
