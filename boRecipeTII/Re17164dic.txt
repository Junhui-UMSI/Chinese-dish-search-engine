Yesterday I got my latest order from the Dixie Diners Club  (800-347-3494); they carry a tremendous selection of FF vegetarian stuff  and their prices are reasonable. They also toss in a booklet of recipes  with each order, and lo and behold! This was in the latest issue. I havent  tried these as Im not into sausage and biscuits. Enjoy!    Biscuits: Preheat oven to 400F. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt,  baking soda and Wonderslim until o biscuit dough-like consistency (add a  little more Wonderslim, if needed). Add buttermilk, mixing together to  complete the dough. Drop by large heaping spoonfuls, 2 inches apart on  cookie sheet lightly coated with non-stick cooking spray. Bake for 8-10  minutes. Makes 18 biscuits. Per biscuit: 89 cal, <1g fat, <1g fiber    For the sausage gravy: Using a blender, puree the flour with the  Wonderslim. Add the broth and water to the blender and puree until smooth.  Empty blender mixture into microwave safe bowl or stove top pan. Add the  dry Beef(NOT!), seasoning salt and Liquid Smoke. Cook in microwave for 1  minute, stir and continue microwaving for 2 minutes or until hot. If you  dont have a microwave, stir on your stove top until hot. Serve over  biscuits or toast. Makes 4 1-cup servings.    Per serving: 69 calories, <1 gram fat, 4.5 grams fiber    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #70    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
