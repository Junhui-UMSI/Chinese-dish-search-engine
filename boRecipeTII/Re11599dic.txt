I havent tried these yet but they look (and sound) really good. I got it  from the Better Homes and Gardens "Baking" issue that is out just now. It  says: "Delicate hearts and flowers are perfectly delightful on a tea or  reception table" so I assume they would work for your sisters wedding.    Stir together flour, butter, and sour cream in a large mixing bowl till  thoroughly combined. Divided dough in half. Cover and chill for 3 hours.    Roll on portion of dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness  (leave the other portion of the dough in the fridge) Using a 2-inch  heart-shape cookie cutter and a 2-inch scalloped cookie cutter, cut dough.  Place HALF the cutouts on an ungreased cookie sheet. Using a 1-inch  heart-shape cutter and a 1-inch scalloped hors doeuvre cutter, cut out  centres from remaining cutouts. Lightly brush water over one side of the  cutouts with holes. Place brushed side down on top of cookies without  holes. Placethe stacks one inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.    Combine granulated sugar and water. Brush cookie tops with mixture. Spoon  1/4 teaspoon of the spreadable fruit into the cutout centre of each cookie.    Bake in a 350 oven for about 12 minutes or till bottoms are lightly  browned. Remove from cookie sheet and cool on a wire rack. Repeat rolling,  cutting, and baking with remaining portion of dough.    Just before serving, spoon a little additional spreadable fruit into each  cutout. If desired, sift powdered sugar on top of cookies.    Makes about 42 Posted to EAT-L Digest 09 Apr 97 by Lilia Prescod  <lprescod@ITRC.UWATERLOO.CA> on Apr 10, 1997
