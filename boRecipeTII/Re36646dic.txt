Strawberry Chiffon Pie
fresh strawberries, Gelatin, Cold water, Sugar, Eggs, 
Beat the egg yolks slightly, then add 1/4 cup of the sugar. Put the mixture  into the top of a double boiler and cook it, stirring constantly until it  thickens. Soak the gelatin in the cold water and add it to the mixture.  Remove it from the heat. Stir in the crushed strawberries, mixing well,  then chill the mixture until it begins to thicken.    Beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Add the rest of the sugar,  beating the mixture until it is stiff. Fold this into the strawberry  mixture, then pour it into a baked pie shell. Chill and serve the pie with  whipped cream.    Variations: Try substituting 3/4 cup of raspberry juice instead of the  strawberries.
