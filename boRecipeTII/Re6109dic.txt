In food processor, combine flours, yeast, salt, sugar, and garlic powder;  pulse to mix.  With the processor in the on position, gradually pour the  warm water through the feed tube. Depending on climate, a little more or a  little less water will be needed. The object is to form a ball of dough  circulating in the processor. Once the ball forms, process for one minute  to knead. Turn dough out onto a very floured surface. Cover with floured  plastic wrap and let rest ten minutes. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F..  Prepare toppings of choice during the rest period; also open a can of fat  free pizza sauce. Peel plastic wrap from dough and use a rolling pin to  roll out the crust to desired shape, on a very floured surface. Transfer  crust to a pizza pan sprinkled with cornmeal. Bake for two minutes before  adding sauce or toppings so the crust can begin to firm up. Remove the  crust from the oven, top as desired, then bake the pizza for about 10  minutes.
