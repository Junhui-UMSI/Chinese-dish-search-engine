Yogurt Cheese #2
Plain yogurt (nonfat; whole,, Any spices you desire;, Little sugar (optional), 
From: marco52@wharton.upenn.edu    Date: 19 Dec 93 10:10:29 EST    The recipe comes from the Frugal Gormet, and is the easiest way possible to  come up with cheese.  Using a pint of plain yogurt (nonfat, whole, it  doesnt much afftect the taste) Mix in any spices you desire, basil,  garlic, pepper, some add a little sugar to counteract the bitterness of the  yogurt. Using a double layer of cheese cloth, pour the yogurt into the  cloth, and tie above the sink to drain. Leave it there for up to 60 hours,  depending on the consistency you want. You wont get anything much more  dense than cream cheese, but it is tasty. I prefer a sort of herb  flavoring, if anyone comes up with another interesting flavoring, please  let me know. One of the things the Frugal Gormet reccommends is a chocolate  sort of thing from cocoa powder and sugar.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /EGGS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
