Nardo" <snardo@ONRAMP.NET>    NOTES : here is a vegetarian chili recipe which is really delicious. Dont  let the moderately long list of ingredients throw you. As is    indicated, all the work consists of chopping and measuring.   It is    cooked in essentially two steps . It could not be simpler! [Note, I do    not know the origin of this recipe.  I believe it is from a commercial    cookbook.  My apologies to the author.]  [The ingredients for this    recipe are organized into two piles since everything but the oil is    added in two batches.]
