Poor Man Cake
Water, Raisins, Nuts, Lard; (I always use butter), Allspice, Flour, Baking soda, Sugar, Salt, 
By the way, there is a similar recipe in the Fannie Farmer Cookbook.    Grandma Mary Tonielli    Mix the raisins, sugar and water. Cook for 10 minutes. Add the lard and let  cool. Then add remaining ingredients. Bake at 300 degrees for 45 minutes.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Maggie Workman <workman@CORIOLIS.EAS.PURDUE.EDU>  on Mar 5, 1998
