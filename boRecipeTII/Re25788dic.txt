OK, yall, weve heard the hype, now comes the *real* thing...;> Get you  some: Baby back ribs (yes, the pork kind), brush them lightly with some Lea  and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce on both sides, so that you can tell that  theres some on em.  Broil them (in the oven) on both sides so that they  are nice and brown (dont COOK em, just give em some color), and place  them in a covered roaster pan in a 250F oven for about 2 hours.    Drain the liquid from the pan and save it for something else.  You can use  some of the meat juice in the Ranch Sauce (recipe follows), or you can  throw it away. Paint the ribs with Ranch Sauce on both sides and put back  in the roaster in the over for about another hour or so. Before serving,  grill them over moderate coals to brown and finish, basting them again with  Ranch Sauce, about 10 - 15 minutes.    Ranch Sauce:  this recipe is from Frito - Lay, circa 1957.  Hard to beat:  Mix all ingredients in a non-reactive saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer  for at least 20 minutes, stirring often so that it doesnt stick.    This, my friends, is fit to eat!
