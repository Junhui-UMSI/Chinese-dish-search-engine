Quick Pancake Syrup
Mapleine, Sugar, Boiling water, 
It really is simple. In my opinion, corn syrup tastes bad. There is  no need to put corn syrup in your syrup. This syrup refrigerates fine  without crystallizing if you get all of the sugar dissolved in the  first place. I like it with 1 cup light brown sugar, and one cup  white sugar, but you can put in different amounts of light or dark  brown sugar depending on how much molasses flavor you like (I like  only a little tiny bit). Heat just until sugar is dissolved.    Frankly, this syrup goes together so quickly, that it just isnt worth  buying Log Cabin anymore. To me, it tastes much better. If you like  imitation maple flavor, put in the Mapleine. If not, leave it out. And  there is something about hot syrup on pancakes or waffles that makes  them just a little bit better on a cold morning. (So reheat leftovers  before serving.)    But I still buy maple syrup from time to time.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
