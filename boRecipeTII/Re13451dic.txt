Sugar, Flour, Turmeric, Salt, Warm water, Dried yeast, 
As you travel around East Africa you will see countless Africans selling  food along the roadsides, in the markets, or through bus and train windows.  They sell fruit, boiled eggs, grilled maize, boiled maize, yogurt, milk,  soda pop, fried dough balls, samosas, yellow buns, and real seasonal  delicacies like roasted mice and termites.  The following are a few East  African snack foods you can try.    Dissolve yeast and sugar to 1/2 cup of warm water.  Let stand for 1/2 hour  until a good froth has formed.  Sift together flour, turmeric and salt and  stir into yeast mixture.  Add water (approximately 1 1/2 cups) and mix  until it forms a stiff batter.  Cover and let rise overnight or until well  risen.    Add more flour and knead until the dough can be handled easily.  Knead on a  well floured surface until smooth.  Break off small pieces of dough and  roll into balls.  Place on a well greased baking sheet.  Bake at 350 degree  for 20 minutes.
