* boneless short rib, blade or rump roast    In large dutch oven or oven-proof casserole with lid, heat half the butter  and oil over medium heat. Cook onions until beginning to brown, about 10  minutes. Reduce heat to low. Cook 7 to 10 minutes or until very tender and  golden. Remove onions; set aside. Wipe casserole.    Lightly coat meat in flour, shaking off excess. Heat remaining butter and  oil in casserole over medium high heat. Add meat in batches (pieces should  not touch) and brown well on both sides. Add to onions.    Pour off any fat. Add beer and bring to boil, stirring to scrape up brown  bits from bottom. Simmer beer over medium heat until reduced by one-third,  about three minutes.

Heat olive oil in heavy skillet.  Add mushrooms. Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes, turning at intervals,  until nicely browned. Add to stew. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  Garnish with parsley.    Makes 4 to 6 servings.    Recipe by: Toronto Stars Best of the Year article, December 29, 1993    Posted to recipelu-digest by GramWag@aol.com on Feb 7, 1998
