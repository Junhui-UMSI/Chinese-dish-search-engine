Tiramisu
Heavy cream, Sugar, Sour cream, Sugar, Strong coffee, Dark rum, Ricotta cheese, 
Beat heavy cream with sugar until stiff. Set aside. Using same beater, beat  together ricotta, sugar and sour cream. Gently fold cream and cheese mixes  together; add rum.  Line an 8 x l3 inch baking dish with lady fingers that  have been soaked with the coffee. Pour cream mix over the cake and let sit  at least 4 hours or overnight. When set, top with unsweetened cocoa. This  is from the Sacred Heart Church of Georgetown CT.    The authentic tiramisu (pick me up) calls for marscapone cheese, which is  relatively hard to get and expensive. I have found the following substitute  works well.  Be sure you use firm or stale lady fingers so it doesnt get  mushy. From: Fred Towner Date: 08-03-93
