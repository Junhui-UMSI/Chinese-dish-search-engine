Barbecue Meatloaf
Onion, Egg, Water, Brown sugar, My Seasoning (follows), Vinegar, Butter, Bread crumbs, Green Pepper; chopped, Prepared mustard, Tomato sauce, Lean Ground Meat, (8 oz) Tomato Sauce, SAUCE, INGREDIENTS, 
My favorite meatloaf recipe.    Combine the beef, bread crumbs, onion, 8 oz tomato sauce, egg, My  Seasoning, and green pepper.  Mix well and place in a loaf pan.    Combine all sauce ingredients.  Cook in a saucepan until butter melts. Pour  sauce over meat loaf and bake at 350F^. for 1 hour. While baking, the sauce  needs to be spooned over the meat occasionally.    Note: Make sure you use a pan large enough for the meat and sauce, or the  sauce will tend to boil over while it is cooking.    My Seasoning: Mix 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part black  pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.       Deidre Anne Penrod, Prodigy Food & Wine Board
