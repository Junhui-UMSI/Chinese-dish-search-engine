Avocado Cake
Sugar, Walnuts; (I used pecans), Pureed avocado; (the riper,, Buttermilk; (I subbed some, Light rum, Heavy cream, Baking soda, Butter, Cinnamon, Salt, Allspice, Nutmeg; freshly ground, Chopped dates; (I subbed, Golden raisins, Confectioners sugar, Salt, Eggs; well beaten, All purpose flour, 
from "Maurices Tropical Fruit Cook Book" by Maurice de Verteuil (some  modifications in directions made)    Cream sugar and butter together. Add eggs; mix well. Add avocado puree; mix  well. Lastly, add buttermilk. Combine spices, salt, soda and flour.  Gradually, add dry ingredients to wet beating well; it should be on the  stiff side. Add dates, raisins and walnuts. Turn into a greased 9x9 inch  baking dish and bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.    Combine cream, rum, salt and sugar and beat until stiff. (Of course, you  must have your bowl and beaters chilled to accomplish this!). Chill. Serve  a "dollop" of this cream on each piece of avocado cake.    NOTE: This recipe can be doubled and baked in a 9x13 inch pan. The cooking  time remains the same. I have never made the cream topping. I prefer to  make a simple glaze with confectioners sugar, lime juice and milk, although  keeping the cake "plain" is just fine. This is a lovely, moist, mildly  spicy, old fashioned cake. People will guess that it is a carrot or  zucchini cake if they dont know what the "secret" ingredient is. The  batter is a lovely shade of green, but the cake bakes up a brown color.
