Tomatoe Pie
Best, Cooked bacon crumbled or, (scant) chopped chives -- or, Grated cheddar cheese -- or, (op, 9" unbaked pie crust, Nonfat mayo, Bac-Os OR -- canadian bacon, Salt & pepper -- to taste, Ripe tomatoes, home grown, Onions/shallots, Fresh basil chopped, Mayonnaise or low fat -- or, Low fat cheese), 
Preheat oven to 400. Drop tomatoes in boiling water for about 10 seconds to  loosen skin and peel. after slicing, allow to drain if the tomatoes are  very juicy.  Fill pie crust with tomatoe slices, mounding towards center.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper, chives, and basil, and bacon if you use it. In  a small bowl, mix mayonnaise with the cheese and spread it over the  tomatoes.  Bake for about 35 minutes. To prevent overbrowning cover with  foil the last 10 minutes.  Good with fish or meat, and its a wonderful  lunch with a nice green salad. You can add just about anything to it. I  sometimes add sliced hard boiled eggs.
