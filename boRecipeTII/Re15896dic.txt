Acorn Squash Soup
Curry powder, garlic, Cayenne pepper, Carrots, Onion, Chicken Stock, Lime wedges, Salt and pepper, olive oil, table, Acorn squash, 
Cut squash in half and remove the seeds.  Put a pat of butter or margarine  in the cavity of each half and roast in the oven at 375  for 40 minutes or  till soft.  Let cool.  In the meantime, saute the carrots and onions in a  little olive oil until caramelized.  Add chicken stock and deglaze the pan.  Add about 1/2 can of water to the stock.  Remove squash from the shell and  put in saucepan with the stock.  Mash down the vegetables as much as you  can.  Add seasonings to taste, then pur?e in blender or food processor.  Return to pot; add cream; and adjust seasonings.  Serve with wedges of lime  to be squeezed on top.    Note: I did not put the butter or margarine in the cavity of the squash  halves -- didnt miss it -- soup was still very rich.  I also simmered the  soup for a little while to soften the vegetables a little more after adding  the squash.
