Tortillas with Spicy Cream Sauce
Boiling water, Parmesan cheese, Cottage Cheese, Onions, Mushroom Soup; (10 oz, Sour cream, (10) Flour Tortillas, 1/4 1/2 ts Jalapeno Sauce, Chicken bouillon cubes, Poppy Seeds, Worcestershire Sauce, Garlic powder, 
This was a Hungarian dish that I Mexicanized. Its really great. Something  different. Actually what happened was I didnt have any egg noodles so I  cut up some flour tortillas and tossed them in. It came out great, and no  one could tell what I had put in it. Makes a great side dish.    Take each Tortilla and cut into 1/4 strips then cut in half. Dissolve  bouillon in water. Add the next 6 ingredients; mix well. Stir in the  cottage cheese, sour cream and the cut up tortillas. Pour into a 2 1/2  quart baking dish. Sprinkle with the Cheese, a bit of Paprika for some  color, cover and bake at 350 for 45 minutes.    Note you can use egg noodles instead of the Tortillas. But its more fun to  make it with the Tortillas and have your guests try to figure out the  secret ingredient.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by "Acagordie" <gordon@mpsnet.com.mx> on Feb  9, 1998
