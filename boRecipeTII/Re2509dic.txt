At 17, the Bake-Off Contests youngest Grand Prize winner created this  recipe for a home economics assignment. This pie is easier to make now  using refrigerated pie crust.    Allow crust pouches to stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.    Meanwhile, in medium bowl combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, pumpkin pie  spice, corn syrup, vanilla and peach slices; mix well. Set aside.    In small saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons of the reserved peach liquid, 1/3  cup sugar, lemon juice and eggs; mix well. Cook over medium heat until  mixture thickens and boils, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute. Remove from  heat. In small bowl, beat sour cream and cream cheese until smooth.  Gradually beat in hot egg mixture until well blended. Set aside.    Heat oven to 425 F. Prepare pie crust according to package directions for  one-crust filled pie using 9-inch pie pan. Spoon filling into crust-lined  pan. Dot with margarine. Spoon topping mixture evenly over filling. Unfold  second pie crust. Using floured 3-inch round cutter, cut out 8 circles from  crust. Brush tops of circles with remaining 1 tablespoon reserved peach  liquid. Arrange pie crust circles over topping.    Bake at 425 F. for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 F; bake an  additional 35 to 40 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cover edge of  pie crust with strips of foil after 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent  excessive browning. Cool. Store in refrigerator. 8 servings.
