Almond Tasty
Unsalted almonds, chopped, Vodka, Chocolate extract, Vanilla bean (1 inch), Lemon wedge, scraped peel, Orange peel, scraped, 
Lightly pound almonds with hammer (in bag or cover with paper towel) and  combine with other ingredients in bottle. Be sure to thoroughly scrape  orange and lemon peels. Let steep for two weeks, turning bottle  occasionally. The chocolate extract tends to settle on the bottom and the  finished liqueur may need to be mixed before serving. Strain and filter.  Experiment with different variations of this recipe, perhaps alternating  hazelnuts or adding some spices. Yield: 1 pint Container: Wide mouth quart  jar
