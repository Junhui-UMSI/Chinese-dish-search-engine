Do not skin, peel, or otherwise denude the vegetables or potatoes. Wash  them briskley and then cut them up. The good stuff is in the skin, always,  as the skin is what was intended to serve, protect and defend the pulp and  seeds. Fill large crock pot half full of clean cold water. Add ingredients.  Let cook on low heat for 12-16 hours. Season as desired during last 1 hour  of cooking, adding bay, etc., as suits your individual collection of buds.  This recipe may be done with any game animal, except that squirrel tends to  be far too stringy for my taste. If you like hearty and thick, this stew is  for you.  It would also go well with beef, obviously.    I do recommend a bay leaf added to the top for the last hour.
