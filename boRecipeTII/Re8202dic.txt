Potato Gnocchi with Quick Tomato Sauce
Butter, fresh peppers, Black Pepper, Parmesan, Flour, basil, fresh, Egg yolk, Garlic, Salt, Onions, olive oil, Boiling potatoes, 
Make gnocchi: Cut potatoes into chunks and pass through a food mill or  potato ricer onto a lightly-floured surface. Make a well in center of  potatoes and add yolk to well. Sprinkle one-third of the flour over  potatoes and combine potatoes, yolk and flour, mixing with your hands. Add  another third of flour, kneading, then remaining flour, until a smooth,  slightly sticky dough is formed. Divide dough in 4 pieces and roll each  into a 15-inch-long rope, about 3/4-inch in diameter. Using a floured  knife, cut each rope into 30 pieces. Dip tines of a dinner fork in flour  and gently roll dough several times back and forth to form decorative  ridges on one side. Make tomato sauce: In a saucepan sweat onion and garlic  in oil over medium heat until onions are golden and tender, 10 minutes. Add  tomatoes and juice; bring to a boil and cook 3 minutes. Add basil and  season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring a large pot of salted water to  a boil and drop in gnocchi. Cook until they rise to surface, about 2  minutes, and continue cooking 30 seconds more. Drain in a colander. In a  large skillet, melt butter, add gnocchi, pour tomato sauce over, and toss  to combine. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve immediately. This recipe  yields 4 servings.
