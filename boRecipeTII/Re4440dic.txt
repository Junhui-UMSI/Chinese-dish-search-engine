I  usually divide the sauce into 4 parts and freeze 3 of them. I use small 1/2  cup air tight containers and the pesto sauce seems to keep quite well.  In  a blender or food processor place the olive oil and garlic, blend well on  high speed. Reduce speed, and add butter and parmesan cheese, blend till  smooth. Add the basil in small quantities, till all is added, and chopped  into small pieces (About the size of a pen head or smaller). If you are  going to freeze some of the sauce, divide and freeze it now. Boil the  spaghetti till done (dont forget to divide the spaghetti if you divided the  sauce). Drain cooked spaghetti and mix with pesto sauce, serve with garlic  bread.    EAT-L Digest 10 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
