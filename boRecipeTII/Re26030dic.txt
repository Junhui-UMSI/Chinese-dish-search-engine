Tofu Dominoes
Flour, Tofu; sliced into, Black pepper to taste, Sesame seeds, Green onion; chopped, Mild cheese (muenster;, Cooking oil, Soy sauce, 
Let the dominoes marinate in the soy sauce for at least 10 minutes, then  turn and let the other side marinate. Heat half the oil in a skillet, and  mix the flour with the sesame seeds and pepper. Dredge the dominoes well in  the flour mixture and place a layer in the skillet. When brown, flip and  brown the other sides. Serve with the cheese grated over the hot tofu, and  sprinkle with onion.    Or forget the cheese and onions and serve it with a really good barbeque  sauce. My kids hate tofu, but theyll eat this!    SYLVIA@ITRC.ON.CA    (SYLVIA GENDERS LEREVEREND)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
