Here two special shortbread recipes.  For the first one,  its a nice story about the origin of these curiously-named shortbread  biscuits: - some say the name was derived from the french "petites  gatelles", meaning    little cakes - others that its origin lies in the shape of the biscuit  which is a replica    of the Elizabethan full gored skirt - third possibility: it was the clever  invention of a cook after years of    broken tips to triangular shaped biscuits :-)    Sift the flour into a bowl and stir in the sugar. Gently heat the butter  and milk together and as soon as the butter has melted stir the liquid into  the flour to make a soft but not sticky dough.    Turn it onto a floured surface and kneat it lightly. Divide the dough in  half then roll the halves out directly onto a baking tray into 9-inch  rounds using a large plate as a guide. Flute the edges.    Cut out a 2-inch circle from the centre but leave it in place. Divide the  outer ring into eight, keeping the inner circle whole. Sprinkle with  granulated sugar and bake at 180 oC (350 oF) for about 30 minutes or until  golden brown and crisp.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
