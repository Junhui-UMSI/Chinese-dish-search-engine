Basic Venison Stock
Thyme, Bones, cut or chopped small, Ribs celery, diced small, Carrots, diced small, Dry red wine (or 1 cup apple, Water, Tomato paste, Bay Leaves, Onions, chopped into 1/2, Meat cut into 1/2 inch cubes, Juniper berries (optional), 
yields about 1 gallon    Method:  Roast bones and meat on a rack in a roasting pan at 400 degrees  until well browned - about 40 minutes.  Put celery, carrot and onion on top  of meat and brown also, another 15 minutes.  When browned, discard fat in  the pan and put bones, meat, vegetables in a pot large enough to hold  everything.  Put roasting pan on a stovetop burner over medium heat, pour  wine into pan and deglaze, scraping any browned residue off pan and add to  stock pot.  Add water, covering the solids, and remaining ingredients.  Bring to a gentle boil then cover and reduce heat to a very slow simmer for  at least six hours, skimming occasionally.  Uncover and simmer for four  more hours or until reduced to a gallon of liquid. Strain, discarding  solids and cool, uncovered.  Cover when fully chilled (and not before or it  may sour).    To make larger batches, just multiply everything except thyme, juniper and  bay.  For each doubling of all the other ingredients, multiply them by 1  1/2 or theyll be too strong.    Thats the basic stock from which well make these two sauces. The first  one is rich; a good sauce to put on venison no matter how youve cooked it.  The second is the fullest taste of venison youre ever likely to find, with  a very deeply concentrated flavor.  This first sauce, Venison Espagnole, is  whats called "a thickened reduction" and the second, Venison Demi-Glace,  begins with the first and more of the stock, then goes to a yet further  reduction.  In each case, flavor is more intensified and developed than in  the stages before.
