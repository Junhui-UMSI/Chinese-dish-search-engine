Preheat oven to 425. Slice 1/4" off top of head of garlic. Wrap garlic in  foil.  In small baking dish, roast garlic until it turns buttery soft, 30  to 40 mins.  Let stand 10 mins. to cool. Meanwhile, in serving bowl, mix  chickpeas with basil and vinegar. Set aside. When garlic is cool enough to  handle, squeeze out each clove into bean mixture. Stir well to coat beans.  Toss with diced tomatoes.  Season with cumin, salt, and pepper. Serve at  room temperature. (Excessive salt?)
