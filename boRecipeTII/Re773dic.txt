Hannukah Fritters (Sfenj)
(2 lbs) sieved flour, Salt, (1 oz) baker`s yeast, 
Here is a recipe for Hannukah from the book "Moroccan Jewish Cookery" by  Viviane and Nina Moryoussef:    Dissolve yeast in a glass of lukewarm water. Mix all the ingredients with a  glass of lukewarm water & knead thoroughly to give a light, soft, elastic  dough. Add a little more water if necessary. Cover with a clean cloth &  leave to rise for 3 or 4 hours. Take a little ball of dough in oiled hands.  Make a hole in the center & pull it out to form a little crown. Drop the  rings one by one into hot oil. Serve these fritters hot & well risen,  dusted with sugar or honey.    They are best when eaten immediately...don`t worry about storing the  leftovers because there won`t be any!!!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "leah perez" <perezleah@hotmail.com> on Nov  01, 1998,
