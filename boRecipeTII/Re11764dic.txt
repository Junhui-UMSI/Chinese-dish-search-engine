Ratatouille with Sausage
Basil, Eggplants, Thyme, Onions, Garlic, parsely, Green peppers, Olive oil, Tomatoes, Zucchini, Flour, parsely, Oregano, salt and pepper, Italian sausage, 
Dredge eggplant and zucchini in flour. Heat oil in heavy large pan and  briefly saute eggplant and zucchini in batches over medium heat for about  five minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Saute onion, garlic and  green pepper in same oil if needed. Save pan to saute sausages.    Preheat oven to 350F. Layer sauteed vegetables, tomatoes, parsely and  seasonings in 6 quarts casserole. Stir gently to mix. Bake, covered 35  minutes.    Meanwhile saute sausages in the reserved pan until browned. Remove from  pan, drain on paper towels and cool. Slice 1/4 inch thick and return to  pan. Saute slices 2 to 3 minutes more on each side. Add more oil to pan if  needed.    After the vegetables have baked 35 minutes add sausages. pushing most of  the slices down into the vegetable mixture, but reserving some for the  casserole top. Return to the oven and bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes.  Garnish with fresh parsely to serve.    Note: This lusty casserole perfumed with the herbs of Provence becomes a  complete main dish when sausages are added. Lots of crusty French and  italian bread, a leafy grean salad and a jug of red wine, followed by fruit  and cheese complere a menu that could be expanded to serve a multitude.  This is WONDERFUL on cold snowy days and feeds a crowd...coming from  Buffalo Bills country (originally) I can tell you that it makes a great  Super Bowl supper. *Flavor greatly improves by making casserole 24 hours  ahead and refrigerating. Bring to room temperature before reheating.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #776 by Dianne Weinsaft <dee@ncsi.net> on Sep  8, 1997
