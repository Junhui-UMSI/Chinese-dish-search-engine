Stir sugar, salt and butter into hot milk; cool to lukewarm. (A drop  sprinkled on wrist will not feel hot.) Sprinkle yeast over warm water in  large bowl; stir to dissolve. Stir in lukewarm milk mixture. Add 2 eggs and  2 1/2 cups flour; beat at high speed with electric mixer. With a wooden  spoon gradually beat in remaining 2 cups flour. Knead with hand until dough  is stiff enough to leave side of bowl. Place dough in lightly greased large  bowl.  Turn the dough over to bring up greased side. Cover with a towel;  let rise in warm place (85 F), free from drafts, until double in bulk,  about 1 hour. Make filling in medium bowl.    Beat eggs slightly; add nuts, brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, cinnamon and  vanilla.  Stir filling to blend well. Shape dough; punch down dough. On  lightly floured surface turn out dough; cover with bowl and allow to rest  for 10 minutes.   Roll out to a rectangle 30 inches long by 20 inches wide.  Spread with filling, to 1 inch from the edge. Starting from wide side, roll  up tightly, as for jelly roll.  With palms of hands, roll back and forth so  that roll is even all over. On large greased cookie sheet, form roll into a  large coil, seam side down. Let rise in warm place (85 F), covered with  towel, free from drafts, until double in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven  to 350 F and brush the roll with the melted butter. Bake 35 to 40 minutes  until golden. Cool on wire rack. Slice crosswise 1/4 inch thick. Makes a 4  pound loaf.
