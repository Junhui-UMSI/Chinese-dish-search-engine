"Mysterious" Wine Drop Cookies
Sour milk, Flour, Baking soda, Molasses, Shortening, Egg, Powdered ginger, Brown sugar, Cinnamon, Ground cloves, Raisins, optional, 
This comes from a great cookbook that was given to me for Christmas many  years ago "Christmas Memories Cookbook" by Mystic Seaport Members. Many of  the recipes in it are fabulous and have become Christmas traditions, as  well as recipes used all year long. The theme of the book is a Victorian  Christmas, but few of the recipes are actually identified as Victorian.  Heres one I could find. If I find more, Ill post them.    A 100-year old recipe. The mystery is ours. Who drank the wine?    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees    2. Cream well the shortening, sugar and egg    3. In medium bowl, combine dry ingredients. In another bowl combine milk  and molasses    4. Add flour and milk mixture. Add raisins    5. Drop by spoonsful onto lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 15  minutes    6. While still warm from the oven, dust with confectioners sugar    One thing the book says is that there were no before dinner drinks or  appetizers. They apparently were not seen in the US until WW1. There may be  more suggestions that would help you in the book. If you have any  questions, e-mail me privately.
