Cornish game hens, Light soy sauce, Black pepper, Stephen Ceideburg, Salt, Sugar, Vietnamese fish sauce, Dry sherry, Shallots, Garlic, Five spice powder, 
This aromatic barbecued game hen can be easily served West- ern style with  rice, cole slaw or a green salad. [But it would be better with Thai  cucumber salad or Vietnamese carrot salad. Mmmm... S.C.]    Halve the hens through the breast. Flatten with the palm of your hand.    In a mortar or food processor, pound or mince garlic, shallots and sugar.  Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly. Pour mixture over hens;  marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight in refrigerator.    Set hens, skin-side down, on grill and barbecue over medium coals for 15  minutes. Turn and barbecue 15 minutes longer or until they are thoroughly  cooked. Serve with Nuoc Cham dipping sauce.
