Leek and Potato Soup
NW, Butter or margarine, Leeks, Chicken Stock, Baking potatoes, Salt and white pepper, Fresh chives, 
You can make this classic French soup in many different ways. Leave the  vegetables whole and cook them in water alone for the most rustic version,  enriched only with a little butter at serving time. For an even richer,  more elegant variation, puree the soup in a food mill, food processor or  blender, then stir in about one cup (8 fl oz/250ml) light (single) cream  and gently rewarm.   Chill that cream soup and you have a classic vichyssoise  The hot puree is also good with some shredded Swiss or Cheddr cheese  stirred in tat the last minute.    In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the leeks and  saute just until they begin to soften, 3- 5 minutes. Add the stock and  potatoes, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until  the potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes.    Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Ladle into warmed bowls and  garnish with the chives.
