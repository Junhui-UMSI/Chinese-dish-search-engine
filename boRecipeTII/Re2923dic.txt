Peanut Butter Milk Chocolate Mousse Cake Pt 2
See part 1, 
Remove the pan and peel off the parchment. Using a 3 1/2-inch diameter ring  mold, cut out 12 rounds from the cake.    2.Brush the insides of twelve 3 1/2-inch ring molds with melted butter and  place on a pan lined with parchment. Set 1 round of cake in the bottom of  each ring. Top each with chocolate mousse to fill completely. Using a small  metal spatula, scrape the top of each mold to make the mousse level with  the top of the mold. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze at least 2 hours or  overnight.    Make the peanut butter icing:    1.In a medium saucepan, combine the peanut butter, butter, cream, corn  syrup and vanilla. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the  butter melts and the mixture comes to a boil.    2.Remove from the heat and sift the confectioners sugar over the mixture.  Using a wire whisk, blend in the sugar until smooth. Allow the icing to  cool for 15 minutes before icing the cakes.    Unmold and finish the cakes:    1.Using a small, sharp knife, gently cut around the edges of each mold to  remove the cakes. Place the cakes on a wire rack set over a sheet pan.  Spoon icing over the top, and using a small metal spatula, smooth the icing  around the sides. Gently press the chopped peanuts around the sides of the  cakes, covering them evenly from top to bottom. Drizzle melted chocolate in  a decorative pattern over the tops. Refrigerate the cakes until ready to  serve.  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #189 by docden <docden@mnl.v-link.net> on  Aug 15, 1997
