Pears Poached in White Wine
Dry white wine, Firm Bartlett or Anjou pears, Stick cinnamon; 3-inches, Lemon juice, (2-inch) strips lemon peel, Water, Sugar, 
In 9-inch saucepan place wine, water, sugar, lemon peel & cinnamon stick.  Bring to boil over moderate heat & simmer, stirring occasionally, until  sugar dissolves. Meanwhile, peel pears and, leaving stem end intact, scoop  out core from the blossom end with a knife. Sprinkle pears with lemon juice  to keep them from turning brown. When pears are peeled & coated with lemon  juice, add remaining lemon juice to sugar syrup & place pears in syrup,  stem end up. Simmer pears uncovered 1 hour or until tender, turning them  from side to side 5 or 6 times, but always leaving the stems up. When pears  are tender, spoon them into a serving dish, strain the syrup over them &  chill in refrigerator for several hours before serving. Makes 6 servings.    MRS B.S.
