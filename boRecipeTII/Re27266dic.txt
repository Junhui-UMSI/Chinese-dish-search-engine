Crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch  springform pan. Stir in butter and espresso powder in  small bowl until combined. Stir in crumbs until crumbs  are evenly moistened. Pat evenly over bottom of  prepared pan. Bake 10 minutes. Cool on wire rack. Keep  oven on. Tightly cover outside bottom and sides or  springform pan with heavy-duty foil. Filling:  Meanwhile, beat cream cheese and mascarpone in large  mixer bowl at medium-high speed until light and  fluffy, 2 minutes. Gradually beat in sugar, scraping  down sides of bowl with rubber spatula, until  completely smooth, 3 minutes. Reduce speed to medium  and beat in vanilla and salt. Add eggs, one at a time,  beating just until blended after each addition. Pour 4  cups filling over crust in prepared pan and place in  large roasting pan. Dissolve espresso in hot water.  Fold into remaining filling with brandy and grated  chocolate. Spoon mixture evenly over filling in pan;  smooth top with spatula. Place pan on oven rack. Pour  enough hot water into roasting pan to come 1" up side  of springform pan. Bake 1-1/4 hours or until center is  just set. Remove cheesecake from water bath. Cool  completely on wire rack. Remove foil. Cover and  refrigerate overnight. Just before serving, run knife  around edge of pan; remove sides. Sprinkle lightly  with cocoa. Makes 12 servings.
