Potatoes with Ginger and Garlic
Ginger root, Vegetable oil, Salt, Cayenne pepper, Water, garlic, Turmeric, Fennel seed, Potatoes, 
Boil the potatoes in their jackets.  Drain and allow to completely cool.  (Can be done the night before.)  Peel and cut into 1-inch cubes.    Put the ginger, garlic, turmeric, water, salt, and cayenne into a blender  or food processor.  Blend until it becomes a paste.    Heat the oil in a large non-stick or cast-iron pan over a medium flame.  When it is hot, add the fennel seeds.  Let them fry for a few seconds. Now  put in the spice paste.  (Careful -- it will spatter and spit.) Stir and  fry for 2 minutes.  Add the potato cubes.  Fry, stirring continuously, over  medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes or until potatoes have a golden-brown  crust.
