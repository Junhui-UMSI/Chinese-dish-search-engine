White Christmas
Mixed dried fruit, Vanilla, Powdered milk, Rice Krispies, Copha, 
In this mornings Syracuse Post-Standard there were several recipes that I  would like to share with you. They seemed to be different from what I have  seen here.    Mix together thoroughly powdered milk, Rice Krispies, confectioners sugar  and dried fruit. Add melted copha and vanilla. Pour into pan and  refrigerate to set. Cut into squares when firm.    * copha is solidified coconut oil. May also use margarine.    Author: Cathy Cope    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Sue Albro <SALBRO@OCMVM.CNYRIC.ORG> on Dec 18,  1997
