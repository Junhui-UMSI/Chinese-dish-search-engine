Chicken with Peppers and Pasta
Onion, Paprika, Chicken, Olive oil, Water, Pasta, Bell pepper, 
I hope we are still on peppers, my beloved vegetable. Here is an easy and  tasty recipe that can be made ahead of time, just adding the pasta before  the meal.    Saute onion in the olive oil. Add peppers and cook for 5-10 more minutes.  Add chicken, sprinkle paprika on top, add water and simmer till chicken is  tender. If it goes dry add some more water. You should have gravy for the  pasta.    Before serving boil pasta according to directions. Take out the chicken to  a serving plate, put pasta into the gravy and toss well till covered. You  can heat it for a short while if you like. Serve hot.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "shoshana kessel" <shoshana_k@hotmail.com>  on Nov 21, 1998,
