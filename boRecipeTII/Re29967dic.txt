Teriyaki Tofu on Buckwheat Noodles with Watercress
Extra-firm, Scallions, Sesame seeds, Tamari, Sake, fresh ginger, Buckwheat noodles, Watercress, Cayenne pepper, Asian sesame oil, 
Drain the tofu well. If you have time, to remove the excess liquid: Place  the tofu on a plate, top with another plate, weight with a heavy can or  skillet, and let drain about 20 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes.    In a small bowl, whisk together the sake, tamari, sugar, sesame oil,  ginger, and cayenne. Set this teriyaki sauce aside.    In a large pasta pot, bring 4 quarts of lightly salted water to a rapid  boil. Add the buckwheat noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until  tender but still firm, about 7 minutes. Drain the noodles.    Working quickly, add the reserved teriyaki sauce to the pot. Bring the  sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Immediately add the scallions,  watercress, and tofu. With tongs or a wooden spoon, stir gently until the  watercress is wilted and the tofu is warmed through, about 3 minutes.    Return the buckwheat noodles to the pot and stir gently with tongs to mix.  If you are serving the noodles at room temperature, they may be served now.  But if you are serving them hot, stir until the noodles are warm, about 2  minutes. Serve in bowls, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. This  recipe yields 3 to 4 servings.    Comments: Buckwheat noodles, called sorba, can be found in health food  stores, in Asian markets, and in some supermarkets. This dish is good  either hot or at room temperature. Sake is a Japanese rice wine. It is  lovely served warm in small cups with this dish.
