Heat the oil in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Fry the onions, ginger  and garlic until the onions are translucent. Add the tomato and stir-fry,  breaking it up with the spoon. Pour in 300 ml / 1/2 UK pint water, and stir  in the other ingredients.  Bring to the boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer  for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Pour into a blender or  food processor and liquidize.    (Note:  this is only one formula of thousands possible. Theres no more a  single recipe for Balti sauce than theres a single recipe for chili. Some  cooks like more garlic, some more chili powder;  some use fresh chilies as  well:  some add yogurt, coconut, cream...you name it.)    (Adapted from 100 BEST BALTI CURRIES, Lowe & Davidson)
