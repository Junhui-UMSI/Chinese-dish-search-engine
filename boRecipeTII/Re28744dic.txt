Texas-Style Chile Con Queso
Velveeta cheese, Rotel tomatoes, And green chiles, 
Cube Velveeta and place in a saucepan.  Pour in tomatoes, and stir  well. Heat (or nuke) until smooth, stirring occasionally.    Serve warm with tortilla chips or Fritos for dipping.    Any leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for close to forever, and  may be re-heated as needed as a topping for nachos, spicy  cheeseburgers, cauliflower, whatever.
