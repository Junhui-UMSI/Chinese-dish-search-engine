Add onions; cook, uncovered, over  low heat for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (The long cooking time  makes the onions mellow and sweet.) Stir in pepper, paprika and bay leaf;  saute over low heat 10 minutes more, stirring frequently. Pour in 6 cans  broth and wine. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve flour in  remaining 1 can broth. Stir into boiling soup. Reduce heat and simmer  slowly for 2 hours. Adjust color to a rich brown with caramel coloring,  season with salt. Refrigerate overnight. To serve, heat soup in microwave  or on stove top. If desired, pour into ovenproof crocks or bowls. Top with  a slice of breat and a sprinkling of grated cheese. Heat under the broiler  until cheese melts and bubbles, about 5 minutes. Leftover soup can be  frozen. Yield: 4 quarts.
