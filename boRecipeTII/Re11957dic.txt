Prune puree replaces most but not all of the fat as some is required for  taste and texture. Fruit juice concentrate is available at health food  stores.    Spray two baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment  paper. Preheat oven to 350.    In a food processor combine the pitted prunes and hot water. Process until  smooth. In a large bowl, whisk together prune puree, butter and oil until  smooth. Gradually whisk in fruit juice concentrate and vanilla.    In another bowl, stir together flour, rolled oats, baking soda and salt.  Add the flour mixture to the prune mixture and blend. Drop by rounded  spoonfuls onto the baking sheets and bake for 12 to 15 min.
