Combine all sauce ingredients and mix in blender or food processor with  metal blade. Pour into a 4-qt oven proof stewing pot and let simmer over  medium heat while you prepare the cabbage balls.    Core the cabbage. Pull off as many leaves as possible till they become too  small to hold filling. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil, place the leaves in  the water, cover, turn to simmer, and let cook for 10 minutes till soft, or  microwave with 1/4 cup water o Combine ground beef, grated potato, chopped  onion, eggs, ketchup, matzo meal (or bread crumbs) and 1/2 cup water. Mix  well. Season with salt and pepper.    Fill the cabbage leaves by placing about 1 tablespoon of the ground meat  mixture in the middle of each leaf. Fold over the sides and roll the  cabbage ball away from you.    Place seam side down in the simmering sauce. Continue till all the cabbage  leaves have been used. (If you have some ground beef balls left over, just  add them to the sauce.) Cut up remaining small pieces of cabbage and  distribute them evenly over the top of the balls. Add the bay leaf. Check  for seasonings. (You may wish to add more lemon juice, cranberry sauce or  brown sugar, according to your taste.) Simmer, covered on top of the stove  for 20 minutes.    OVEN: 350 Bake uncovered for 20 minutes more to brown the top.    NOTES : Excellent. Lots of extra ground meat made lots of meatballs and  cooked in same pot, freezes well..used ground turkey...can reduce lemon  juice...
