* Paul Prudhommes Hot and Sweet Pizza and Pasta Magic is very good with  this.    Note 1: For Panasonic/National machines, use 3 1/2 teaspoons of yeast for  the 1 1/2 pound loaf.    Note 2: If your machine has a mix cycle, add the pepperoni at the "add"  beep. Otherwise, pepperoni should be added after the initial mix.    Source: Gread Bread Machine Recipes by Norman A.
