I used my crock dill brine and decreased the salt from the original recipe  which called for 2 ts. due to the high salt content of my brine. I forgot  the egg that is called for! I used 3 ts. Active Dry Yeast instead of the 3  pkg. called for in the conventional recipe. I warmed the brine and the  water.
