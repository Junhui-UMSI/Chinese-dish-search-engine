From: ted1@rsvl.unisys.com (Edward Stafford)    Date: 20 Aug 1994 12:53:52 -0400  Beat the egg into the flour and salt until creamy then beat in the milk.  Place in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Heat oven to 400F (200C).  Place a 9  In. thin sided pie dish in the oven with a little fat in it (best is fat  from the roast beef you are cooking otherwise use lard or oil). Leave the  dish to get smoking hot. Remove the batter from the fridge and beat it.  Quickly open the oven, pour the batter into the dish and close the oven.  N.B. It is important that the pan be hot and that the oven be closed  quickly in order for the pudding to rise. Cook for 20 minutes.    A variation of this is the famouse Toad In The Hole.  Follow the recipe  above but partially cook some sausages in the dish before adding the  batter.    Bye the way it is essential to eat Yorkshire oudding with a good gravy.
