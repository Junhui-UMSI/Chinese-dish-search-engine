This is the marinade and the basting sauce ( while on the  grill).    SLIGHTLY CUT LINES INTO THE STEAK and then again CROSSWIDTH; DO the same  for the other side. Mix the ingredients above and pour over steak in a flat  baking dish. Refrigerate over night; at least turn steak over once while  marinating.    Get the coals the way you want them, pop on the steak, baste with its  marinade; cook it to your liking!  If you want, you can still use that  sauce poured on your steak for a gravy.    I created this marinade and always had praise when company came over for a  BBQ and had this recipe .
