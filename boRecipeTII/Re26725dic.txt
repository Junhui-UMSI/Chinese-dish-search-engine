Bajan Seasoning
Vinegar, Salt, Fresh thyme, Garlic, Green onion, Bonney peppers, Black pepper, Fresh parsley, Fresh marjoram, Worcestershire Sauce, Ground cloves, Onions, 
Found this recipe in the Dec. 96 issue of Chile Pepper magazine. Sounds  much like the Lotties Seasoning which Romain is trying to duplicate.    In a food processor, combine the onions, green onions, garlic and peppers  and process to a coarse paste.    Remove the leaves from the stems of the thyme, parsley, and marjoram.    Place the leaves and the vinegar in a blender and liquefy.    Combine the onion paste, vinegar mixture and the remaining ingredients in a  bowl and mix well.    Cover and refrigerate for a whole week before using. The seasoning will  keep in the refrigerator for at least six months.    Yield: two to three cups.
