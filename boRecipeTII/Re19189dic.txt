Vegetable Pakoris
Onion rings, Eggplant, potato, Salt, cauliflower, Ground cumin, Cumin seeds, Baking soda, Ground coriander, Fresh vegetables of your Choice:, Whole ajwain seeds, Ground turmeric, Mushrooms, The batter:, Chickpea flour, Potato, Cayenne pepper, 
Sift the chickpea flour, salt and baking soda together into a bowl.  Add  all the other spices for the batter. Very slowly and gradually pour in  1-1/4 cups water, beating with a fork or a wooden spoon as you do so.  You  should have a smooth batter. Heat the oil in a wok or other utiensil for  deep frying over a medium flame. Tpr. 350-375. Put the potato slices into  the batter.  Lift out a handful with your fingers and let any extra batter  drip back into the bowl.  Now put these slices into the hot oil, as many as  the wok will hold in a single layer. Fry slowly, about 7 minutes on each  side. When the outside is golden grown and crisp, remove fritters with a  slotted spoon and leave to drain on a mesh rack or on paper towels.  Separate the onion rings, and proceed as before. Do all the vegetables this  way, dipping them in the batter, draining, frying and draining them.  Ideally as each batch is fried, it should be eaten. I suspect these could  be twice fried as we do so many chinese things like eggrolls.
