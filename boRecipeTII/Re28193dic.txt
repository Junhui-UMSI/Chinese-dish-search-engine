This recipe for an egg casserole was contributed by Irene Ulanov, of  Northbrook, Illinois. 1. Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add  potatoes, mushrooms and yellow onion. Saute until potatoes are  crisp-tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside. 2. Heat oven  to 350 degrees. Mix egg yolks, half-and-half, cayenne and salt in small  bowl. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. 3. Spread potato mixture  evenly over bottom of a buttered 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Pour egg yolk  mixture over potatoes. Spread green pepper, green onions and 3/4 cup of the  cheese over egg yolk mixture. Spoon beaten egg whites evenly over all.  Sprinkle with remaining cheese. 4. Bake until puffed and top is golden,  about 20 minutes. Serve immediately garnished with parsley.
