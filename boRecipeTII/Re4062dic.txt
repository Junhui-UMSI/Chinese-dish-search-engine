Peppermint Patties
Green food colouring, sweetened condensed milk, Peppermint extract, Chocolate flavored candy, 
In large mixer bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, extract and food  coloring if desired. Add 6 cups sugar; beat on low speed until smooth and  well blended. Turn mixture onto surface sprinkled with confectioners  sugar. Knead lightly to form smooth ball. Shape into 1-inch balls. Place 2  inches apart on wax paper-lined baking sheets. Flatten each ball into a  1-1/2 inch patty. Let dry 1 hour or longer; turn over and let dry at least  1 hour. With fork, dip each patty into warm candy coating (draw fork  lightly across rim of pan to remove excess coating). Invert onto wax  paper-lined baking sheets; let stand until firm.
