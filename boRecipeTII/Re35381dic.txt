Beef Chili, Texas Style - James Mcnair
Yellow onion; finely chopped, Cooked pinto beans, Ground cumin, Unbleached flour, Safflower oil, Salt and pepper, Round roast; trimmed, Garlic; minced, Tomato sauce, Cayenne, Ground chili powder;, 
Quickly rinse the beef under running cold water and pat dry with paper  towels. Chop the beef with a sharp knife or food processor, or cut it into  1/2-inch cubes. Reserve.    Heat the oil in a dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium heat. Add the  onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the beef and garlic and  cook until the meat is just past the pink stage. Add the chili powder,  cumin, flour, and salt, black pepper, and cayenne to taste; mix well. Stir  in the tomato sauce, reduce the heat, and simmer, uncovered, until the  flavors are well-blended, about 1 hour. Stir in the cooked beans, if using,  the last 20 minutes of cooking. Add a little water to the pot anytime  during the cooking if the mixture begins to dry out.    Serves 12.    NOTES : "This easy yet tasty version comes from my sister Martha, who wraps  it in warm tortillas with an array of toppings (grated jack cheese, chopped  red onion, chopped tomato, chopped cilantro, shredded lettuce, salsa). It  is also good served in bowls with the garnishes passed."  Recipe by: Beef - James McNair    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1009 by KSBAUM <KSBAUM@aol.com> on Jan 14,  1998
