This came from the recipe request board at Mimis Cyberkitchen.    Preheat oven to 400F. Wash the pig inside and out. Flatten the pig and  season the inside with the seasonings. Now roll back up and tie with heavy  string, securely.Place in a large roasting pan on top of a rack. Rub the  skin of the pig with the oil and place in the oven for 90 minutes. Lower  the heat to 350F. Baste the pig with the juice at the bottom of the pan and  then add the wine and vinegar to the pan. Return to the oven and cook for  another 10 to 15 minutes per pound. Baste 2-3 times during the baking.  Dont squeeze the pig because the skin is crunchy and it will break.    To serve, place whole pig on a large platter and garnish with sliced apples  and parsley. Serves many people.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 28 Nov 96    From:    Leslie Duncan <duncan@VIANET.ON.CA>    Date:    Fri, 29 Nov 1996 13:35:40 -0500
