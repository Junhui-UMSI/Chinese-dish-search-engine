Strawberry Fruit Flan
Red transparent glaze, Unsalted margarine, Fresh strawberries (or more), Unsalted margarine, Eggs, Evaporated milk, Sugar, Sugar, Flour, Baking Powder, Vanilla, 
In small bowl, mix margarine, sugar and eggs until creamy. Add evaporated  milk and vanilla.    In another bowl, sift flour and baking powder together. Stir into margarine  mixture in small amounts.    Grease a 12 inch fruit flan tin with a fluted rim. Sprinkle with flour.  Pour in mixture and spread evenly with a knife.    Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let  cool for 10 minutes after removing from oven.    Drain strawberries; reserve juice. Turn cake upside down and fill with  strawberries. (If strawberries are very large, you may want to slice them  in half. Sprinkle with sugar and allow to sit for 1 hour.) Add the  strawberry juice to the glaze mix. Prepare glaze, following instructions on  back of package. (NOTE: If you have accumulated approximately 1/2 cup of  juice from the strawberries, and the glaze mix requires 1 cup of water, use  the 1/2 cup of juice plus 1/2 cup of water to make 1 cup of liquid.) Pour  glaze over strawberries.    Posted by: Bill McGimpsey
