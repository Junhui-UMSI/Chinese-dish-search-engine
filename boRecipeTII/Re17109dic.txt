Vinegar Spiced Nuts
Vanilla, Cinnamon, Vinegar, Mixed nuts or peanuts or, Water, Granulated sugar, 
Boil all together until it spins a thread. Stir in nuts until it sugars.  Pour out on waxed paper and separate nuts with a fork. A real special treat  for that special company!  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 236 by "Diane Geary"  <diane@keyway.net> on Nov 10, 1997
