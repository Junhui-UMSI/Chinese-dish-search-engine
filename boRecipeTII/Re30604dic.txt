I found it in a book called The Complete Asian Cookbook, by Charmaine  Solomon.    Chop bean curd into small pieces or mash roughly with a fork. Stir into  eggs, season with the salt and pepper and add spring onions. Heat a large  flat frying pan, grease the base lightly with oil and fry the egg mixture  in small round omelettes no larger than saucer size. Make several and keep  warm until all the mixture is cooked. Pour them over the sauce (which can  be made well ahead) and serve immediately.    Sauce: In a small saucepan heat the oil and fry onion and garlic on a low  heat, stirring frequently, until the oino is soft, about 5 minutes. Add  tomato and fry, stirring, for 3 or 4 minutes, or until  the tomato is  cooked to a pulp. Add soy sauce, water and sugar, bring to the boil. If  made ahead, reheat before using.
