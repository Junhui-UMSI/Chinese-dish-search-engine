Recipie for Leftover Ham
Aro light corn syrup, Ry mustard, Bread crumbs, Orchestershire Sauce, milk, Green onions, Ground ham, Ground fresh pork, Slightly beaten egg, Red currant jelly, 
Mix meat, crumbs, milk, onion, egg and a dash of pepper. Shape into a loaf.  Cook in a shallow baking dish.(I use the Deep Dish Baker) Bake 350 degrees  oven for 1 1/2 hours. During last 30 minutes, spoon on Tangy Mustard Glaze  as Follows: Combine last four ingredients and baste ham loaf with glaze.  Serve remaining sauce on the side. This is great for buffet lunches as the  ham loaf can be made in advance and heated before serving. I always serve  the cheesy sour cream potatoes with this dish.
