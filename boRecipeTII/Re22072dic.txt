Turkey Fried Rice (Tallahassee Democrat)
Black pepper, Ground turkey, Frozen mixed Vegetables,, Soy sauce, Ground ginger, Eggs, Onion, Cayenne pepper, brown rice, cooked, 
"My family adores this Americanized stir-fry. It won our newspaper contest  for recipes using ground Turkey several years ago, and weve enjoyed it  ever since. I did make two changes: I use more vegetables than the original  and I dont use any fat to brown the turkey. Best with left over rice.  Otherwise cook some instant rice while you prepare the first part of the  recipe." -- Lorrie Guttman, Food Editor, Tallahassee Democrat, Tallahassee,  FL (1993)    Brown ground turkey in a skillet over medium heat. Add eggs; scrambles with  turkey. Add onion; cook until onion is brown. Add mixed vegetables, soy  sauce, pepper, ginger and cayenne; mix well. When vegetables are cooked,  add cooked rice. Cook, stirring, until liquid has evaporated and mixture is  heated through. Serve at once.    Pats Notes:  This may work well with left over cooked turkey, very  coarsely chopped and fried in a little oil to help set the egg.
