Pickling spice, Juice from pickled beets, White vinegar, Garlic, Bay Leaf, Bruise, Hard-boiled eggs, 
* Use about 2 tablespoons of the juice from pickled beets if desired; gives  a pink color and adds a pleasant taste.    Simmer vinegar and spices uncovered for 10 minutes; cool slightly, add  garlic and bay leaf. Pack eggs into a screw top jar, add vinegar mixture;  cover and cool to room temperature. Refrigerate 7-10 days before serving,  longer for stronger flavor.    Recipe By     : Jo Merrill    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
