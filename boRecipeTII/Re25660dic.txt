Awesome Cheesecake
Lemon juice, Cream cheese, (500 ml) sour cream, Sugar, Vanilla (or almond), Eggs, 
Cream the cream cheese, then add the ingredients in the order given- one at  a time. Pour into a spring form pan on top of a graham wafer crust. Bake at  325 degree oven for one hour, then turn off the oven, do not open the door  for one hour.  If you have a self-cleaning oven, you will need to open the  door just a little, and prop it open for the hour (I find a folded grocery  bag is the right size).  Remove from oven, and put the cake into the fridge  (after it cools) for about 8 hours.    Top with fruit- cherry pie filling, fresh or frozen strawberries, etc.,  then with a dollop of whipped cream.
