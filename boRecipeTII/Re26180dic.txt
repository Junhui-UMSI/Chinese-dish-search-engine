Coconut milk, Salt, Water, dried galangal, Boneless chicken breast, Dried crushed red chilis, Sugar, lemon grass, 
Place the chicken, lemon grass and galangal in a soup pot. Add the water  and cook over medium for about 30 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients  and simmer for 20 minutes. You may need to adjust the salt, sugar and water  as I find the taste varies with the brand of coconut milk used. Serve with  extra chilis and white rice.
