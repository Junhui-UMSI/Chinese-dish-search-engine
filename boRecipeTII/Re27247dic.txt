I do hope im using the  right words for a recipe.    For the cream: Beat egg whites until they reach the "soft peak" stage.  While stirring slowly add sugar, vanillin and yolks.  Add mascarpone and  keep stirring until you get a soft cream without clots.    In a bowl stir coffee, liqueur and sugar. Dip one buiscuit at the time and  layer them on a cooking dish or pan. Divide the cream into two and pour one  half on the fisrt biscuit layer. Prepare a second layer of biscuits on top,  in the same way. Add cocoa to the second half of cream and stir it into a  uniform brown cream. Pour the cream on top. Sift a thin layer of cocoa on  top of the "tirami su" and chill for a couple of hours before serving.    If you happen find out you need some more biscuits or liquid mix dont  worry, just add more ingredients. ciao, maria teresa    [another tip: put in a layer of dry buiscuits and use a spoon to spread  coffee over each buiscuit before pouring in the cream mix - prevents  buiscuits from getting soggy - grant ]    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
