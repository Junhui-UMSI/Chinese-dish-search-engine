Yeast Test Recipe
Extract, Cascades hops (finish), Clusters hops (boil), M&F light unhopped malt, Crystal malt, Gypsum, M&F light unhopped spray, Ale yeast, 
This is a 7-gallon recipe. Steep crystal malt while bringing water to  a  boil. Remove crystal malt and add extract. Boil. This is a 7-gallon recipe  that was divided into 7  1-gallon  fermenters for the purpose of testing  different yeasts. Fermentation  was  carried out at 75-85 degrees. Best  results were obtained with Edme  ale  yeast which was well-rounded and  slightly sweet. Some  diacetyl,  but  nice balance. Whitbread ale yeast was  lighter and crisper, but had a  poorer head and some esters. CWE ale yeast  was very dry but had a good head and no esters---fermentation was  frighteningly fast.
