Heres my all-time favorite - from the San Antonio Herb Society Cookbook:    (Fran Rich, adapted from Betty Crockers Southwest Cooking)    This is absolutely delicious, and it always gets raves when I serve it to  guests.    With hands, spread mustard over pork tenderloin. Heat oil and garlic in  10-inch skillet until hot. Cook pork in oil over medium heat until brown.  Stir in remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling; reduce heat, cover and  simmer until pork is done, about 30 minutes. Remove bay leaf.    Serves 4 - 6.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 01 Feb 97 by Fran <frich@TENET.EDU> on Feb 2, 1997.
