Water, Celery; finely chopped, Flour, Monterey jack cheese; shredd, White wine, Half and half, Dill seeds, wine bouillon, Seasoned salt, Dried thyme leaves, 6-8 oz. trout fillets, Marjoram leaves, wine sauce, Butter, Rosemary, Onion, Dry white wine, Pepper, 
Mix the water and wine in a large pan or wok and add the seasonings.  (Adjust the amounts of water and wine to taste.)  Arrange trout fillets on  a rack and steam for 10-11 minutes or until they flake easily with a fork.  Remove fillets to a platter.  Discard the remaining steaming liquid.  Carefully lift any bones remaining from the meat leaving each fillet in a  solid piece.    In a small sauce pan, saute celery and onion in the butter over a medium  heat untiltender, about 5 minutes.  Add the flour, pepper, marjoram and  thyme, stirring until it is smooth.  Gradually blend in the half-and-half.  Continue over a medium heat, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens  and begins to bubble, about 5 minutes.  Mix in the cheese until it is all  melted and remove from the heat.  Merge the wine with the sauce slowly,  mixing thoroughly.    Serves 4.    Recipes sent to me from Bill, wight@odc.net
