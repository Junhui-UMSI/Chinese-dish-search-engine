White Chocolate Ganache
OPTIONAL FLAVORING, White chocolate, Grand marnier, Heavy cream, 
In a saucepan add any optional flavoring to the heavy cream. Heat the cream  until hot but not boiling. Remove the zest or lavender. Remove from the  heat. Stir the chocolate into the cream until smooth. Let cool until almost  spreadable, but still pourable. This can be kept warm over a double boiler  or remelted in the microwave.    Yield: Enough for a 6-inch, 9-inch, 12-inch cake. If covering the cake for  100 people, use 12 cups of chocolate (about 5 pounds) and 3 cups of cream.
