Peanut Butter and Jelly Bars
butter, Baking Powder, Sugar, Flour, Egg, Grape jelly, 
This is sort of fun one--popular one with the kids, you can be sure. I got  this of the "Reeses Peanut Butter Bits" package many a year ago.    Heat oven to 375 .    Grease 9" square baking pan. Stir together flour, sugar, and baking powder;  with pastry blender or fork, cut in buttter until mixture resembles coarse  crumbs. Add egg; blend well.    Reserve half of mixture; press remaining mixture onto bottom of prepared  pan. Spread jelly evenly over crust. Sprinkle 1 cup peanut butter chips  over jelly. Stir remaining chips into remaining crumb mixture; sprinkle  over top.    Take spatula and insert into dough. Lift and drag spatula across dough and  then end up on the bottom. Marble entire dough in this fashion. Bake 25 to  30 minutes or until lightly brown. Cool completely in pan on wire rack. Cut  into bars.
