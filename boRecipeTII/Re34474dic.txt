Bean Salad
(16 oz) garbanzo beans;, Vegetable oil, White vinegar, Rib celery; chopped, Onion, DRESSING, salt and pepper, (16 oz) green beans; drained, (16 oz) yellow wax beans;, SALAD, Sugar, (4 oz) sliced mushrooms;, Green pepper; seeded and, (16 oz) kidney beans; rinsed, 
DRESSING: Mix together and set aside    Salad: Combine all ingredients for the salad. (The garbanzo beans are  optional.) Pour dressing over, and mix well. Place in a container with a  cover, and let chill in refrigerator for 12 hours or longer. To serve,  drain dressing from the salad. Serve on a lettuce leaf with a wedge of  hard-boiled egg for garnish.    This keeps about 2 weeks in the fridge.    Notes: This was my late mother-in-laws recipe. She never added the  garbanzo beans, but I do because Kenny loves the nutty flavor they add to  this salad. You can add more or less pepper and celery, if desired.    One time I drained a can of canneloni (is that right? those white Italian  beans that look like kidney beans?)...and that was really good as well.    Also note that I usually buy the store brand of veggies...I cant tell the  difference between them and their many cents higher name brands with lots  of advertising.
