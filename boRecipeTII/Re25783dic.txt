Baby Back Ribs
Garlic powder, Salt, Cumin, Black pepper, Thyme, Cayenne pepper, 
Mix together ingredients. Remove the membrane from the underside of the  ribs. Sprinkle ribs with spices--make more if you have to--and let marinade  for as long as you want. Use a barbecue grill with the coals on the sides  (a dome shape grill works well). Stand up the ribs in a rib rack (available  at most hardware stores, but Ive also made them out of coat hangers) in  the center of the grill. The convection effect of the coals on the side  will cook the ribs very well. Keep the temperature as low as possible  (about 200 F if you can) and feed the coals every half hour. Once theyre  done (about 1 1/2 hr-> 2 hrs) you can put barbecue sauce on them, although  the purist always serves the sauce on the side.     PS: make sure you dont put the ribs directly over the coals--the fat from  them will cause a fire and burn the ribs.
