Braai Vegetable Mix (Barbeque)
Potatoes; peeled and chopped, Brown sugar, Butter *, Soup powder**, Sliced onion, Butternut squash; peeled and, 
* Here the original called for 5 tbsp butter - I used a couple of sprays of  Pam spray and it worked great    ** (I didnt have any, so mashed a veggie bouillon cube and mixed with some  dried parsley and dried onions)    Mix all ingredients together Place in 1 person foil packets (I used 4 of  them) This is supposed to be barbequed, but I baked it for an hour at about  350.    Also can add mushrooms and garlic.    Posted to fatfree digest by joanne mccubrey <mccubrey@calweb.com> on Oct  07, 1998,
