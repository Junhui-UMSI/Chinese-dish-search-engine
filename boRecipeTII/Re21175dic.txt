Tyropitta (Cheese Triangles)
Feta cheese, Butter, Phyllo dough, Milk, Butter, Salt and pepper, Flour, Eggs, Dill, 
Melt the 3 tbsp butter, add the flour and stir well to blend. Slowly add  the hot milk, stirring constantly to make a thick, creamy sauce. Remove  from the heat. Add the salt and pepper, and continue to stir the sauce  until it is cool. Crumble the cheese into small pieces and add them to the  sauce. Add the eggs; stir well, then add the dill, and mix until well  blended.    Cut each of the sheets of phyllo lengthwise into 3 strips. Take 1 strip at  a time (keep the others covered to prevent their drying out). Holding the  strip horizontally, brush it with the melted butter. Put a teaspoonful of  the filling in the lower left corner, then fold over to make a triangle  along the strip. Fold the upper left corner over to close the triangle.  Continue to fold the phyllo over and over until the strip has become a  small (about 3-inch) triangle of pastry. Brush the top with butter.  continue to prepaer all of the pittas like this. Place the triangles on a  lightly buttered baking dish and bake in a preheated 300 degree oven for 15  to 20 minutes. Serve hot.
