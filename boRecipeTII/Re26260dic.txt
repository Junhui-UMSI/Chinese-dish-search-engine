Tomato and Basil Pesto
Fresh Lemon Juice, basil, Balsamic vinegar, Salt, Vine-ripened tomatoes, Italian ?, garlic, Black Pepper, 
* Core the tomatoes and cut in half.  Grill over very hot coals for only a  few minutes to take some of the colour and flavour. (Use oven broiler if  you dont have access to hot coals.) Remove from the grill and set aside to  cool. * Place basil, parsley, and garlic in a food processor. Process until  smooth. Add the tomato, vinegar, and lemon juice and process. Season with  the salt and pepper to taste.  (I always leave out the salt and go heavy on  the black pepper)
