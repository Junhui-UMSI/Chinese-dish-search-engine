Alice Robertson, my next door neighbor, gave me this recipe in 1977 when we  bought this house right next door to them. We immediately "took" to each  other and were now closer than sisters.    Layer 2: Mix together and spread over layer 1, being sure you touch the  sides of the bowl to "seal" it.    Layer 3: Sprinkle over layer 2.    Cover with saran wrap and refrigerate overnight.    LAYER 4: Just before serving, add the following to the top of layer 3.    To serve: Do not toss. Dig to the bottom to serve some of each of the four  layers.    This makes a lot, and is great for a make-ahead salad. It looks really  pretty in a clear salad bowl so all the layers show through. This was one  of my late mother-in-laws favorites.
