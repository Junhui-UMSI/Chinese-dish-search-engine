Put the white beans in a pot with cold water and bring up to a boil. Boil  for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat and let rest for 1 hour. Pour off  water and add 6 more cups cold water. Bring up to a boil and simmer the  beans until tender but not soft. Add 1 teaspoon salt halfway through  cooking time. Drain the beans and transfer to a mixing bowl. While warm,  dress with 1/3 cup of the olive oil, 1/4 cup of the vinegar, and salt and  pepper.    Warm the remaining 2/3 cup olive oil in a saute pan and heat the garlic and  sun-dried tomatoes for just a minute or two. Add half this mixture to the  beans and mix well.    When the beans are cool, add the chopped onions. Season with salt and  vinegar to taste. Combine the rest of the sun-dried tomato oil with the  remaining 4 tablespoons of vinegar.    To cook the shrimp, saute in the reserved sun-dried tomato vinaigrette or  broil and then toss with the vinaigrette before placing atop bean salad.    Just before serving fold in 1/4 cup chopped basil and top with the cooked  shrimp that have been tossed in the sun-dried tomato vinaigrette.
