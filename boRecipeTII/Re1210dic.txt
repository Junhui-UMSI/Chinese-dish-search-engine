Wash pot roast and lay in crock pot, flit side down. Slice garlic into thin  slices and lay over the top, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Set  dial on low and let cook, covered, for about 5 hours. Sometimes, relative  to the shape of the roast it will be done in 4 hours. Check to see if the  meat easily pulls away.    Serve with mashed potatoes and a gravy made from the juices in the pot.    Gravy: Just dissolve cornstarch in milk or water and put into stovetop pan  with crock pot juices. Cook over medium heat until thickened.    Recipe by Mangia!
