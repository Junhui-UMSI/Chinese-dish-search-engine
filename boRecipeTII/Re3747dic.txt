Earlier in the day, add enough water to the skinned chicken to cover it.  Poach chicken in simmering water (uncovered) until chicken is no longer  pink. This will take about 8 minutes. Allow chicken to cool in poaching  liquid. (I put it in the refrig. rather than leave it at room temp. Cooling  it in the liquid makes it more tender) Later, remove chicken from poaching  liquid and chop it into small or bite-size pieces. Save the poaching liquid  to add to the water youre going to cook the pasta in. In large non-stick  pan, cook the onion and garlic in heated olive oil until softened. Add hot  pepper flakes and tomatoes and juice. Cook about 30 minutes over med. heat  until sauce thickens. Cook penne in poaching liquid with additional water  as needed. Combine chicken with the sauce mixture in serving bowl. Add  parsley and cheese. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately.
