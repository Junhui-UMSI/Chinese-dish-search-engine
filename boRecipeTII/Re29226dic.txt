Baked Spaghetti Parmesan
Eggs, Parmesan cheese, Spaghetti, Mozzarella cheese, 
Combine spaghetti, eggs and Parmesan cheese. Place half the mixture in a  greased baking dish. Add half the Mozzarella cheese. Repeat with remaining  spaghetti and Mozzarella. Bake in a 350 degrees oven for 20 minutes. Cut  into squares and serve with spaghetti sauce    . Serves 4. Note: I doubled the recipe and baked in 9 x 13 casserole. I  heated the spaghetti sauce in a separate dish and let everyone ladle out  the amount desired for their serving.
