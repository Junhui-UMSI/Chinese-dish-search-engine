Make the  pesto by blending the basil leaves, garlic, Parmesan, and olive oil to a  paste in a food processor or blender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Moisten two 12-inch squares of cheesecloth (if you cant find cheesecloth  you can use Handi Wipes) with water and wring dry. Lay the squares out  flat, one on top of the other, and use them to smoothly line a 2 1/2-cup  plain mold or plastic container with straight sides. Spread 1/6 of the  cheese mixture in the prepared mold. Cover with 1/5 of the pesto filling,  extending it evenly to the sides. Repeat layering until the mold is filled,  finishing with the cheese mixture. Fold the end of the cloth over the top  of the cheese-pesto loaf and press down lightly to compact it. Chill the  loaf until it is firm, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Invert it onto a serving dish and  gently pull off the cloth. If the loaf is allowed to stand any longer, the  cloth will dry out and will cause the green of the filling to bleed into  the cheese.  May be made up to 5 days ahead if you unmold it, cover with  plastic wrap, and keep refrigerated. Garnish with additional sprigs of  basil.  Serve on French baguette slices. The loaf freezes well wrapped in  plastic wrap.    Recipe is from _Nathalie Dupree Cooks for Family and Friends_.    EAT-L Digest 24 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
