Pesce Alla Ligure (Fish, Ligurian Style)
Whole fish; approximately 8, Chopped fresh italian, Salt, Ligurian extra virgin olive, Minced fresh garlic, Small black olives;, Few sprigs fresh marjoram;, Dry white wine; preferable, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Carefully gut, clean, and scale each fish,  leaving the head and tail intact. If you choose to, place a little fresh  marjoram, tarragon, or rosemary in the cavity of each fish. Then place the  fish in a baking dish large enough so that the fish fit in snugly but  without pressing up against the sides or against one another. Combine the  wine and oil in a bowl or measuring cup and then pour this mixture over the  fish. Add the olives and optional salt to the liquid. Cover with aluminum  foil and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily at the  touch of a fork. When the fish is cooked, toss on the garlic and parsley  and serve the fish on a plate to which the olives and some cooking liquid  have been added.
