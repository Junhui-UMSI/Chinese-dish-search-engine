Almond Pinecone
Mayonnaise; Lowfat-Ok, Dill, Cream Cheese; Lowfat-Ok, Whole Almonds; Toasted, Bacon; Cooked And Minced, Scallion; Chopped, Black Pepper; To Taste, 
1. Toast the almonds and set aside.    2. Combine all other ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Chill for at least        1    hour.    3. Form the cream cheese mixture into the shape of a pinecone. Beginning at  the bottom,, gently press the almonds in rows across the pinecone shape.  Continue the rows until the whole shape is covered, and resembles a  pinecone. Either eat immediately or refrigerate. Allow to come up to room  temperature before serving. Garnish with greens.    NOTES : A marble board works well for this as it will hold the cool  temperature longer than a plate. If fresh greens are used be careful that  they are not poisonous.
