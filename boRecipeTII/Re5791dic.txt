From: viv@higgs.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi)    Date: Sat, 12 Feb 94 18:44:03 +1100  In response to a recent request for recipes for some Italian biscuits/  cookies made with pignoli....here is a collection of a variety of different  types which are popular in Italy...I hope they please!!    Mix together the almonds, sugar and 2 of the egg whites, working the  ingredients together to a pliable (not crumbly) almond paste dough. Preheat  the oven to 450F.    Put the remaining egg white in a bowl and break up with a fork.  Spread the  pine nuts out on a plate. Take small pieces of the almond paste in your  fingers and roll into about 30 walnut-sized balls. Dip each ball in egg  white, then roll in the pine nuts until evenly coated. Put the balls in  paper petit four cases and place on baking sheets. Bake for 5 minutes.  Transfer to wire racks and leave to cool.
