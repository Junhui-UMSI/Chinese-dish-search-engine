Sugar or its equivalent in, Green cabbage, about, Carrots, White rice vinegar or white, Or more small dried hot, Broccoli stalks, Water, Salt, Crushed red pepper, 
First, make the syrup. Place sugar, vinegar, water, salt, and chiles in a 1  1/2-qt. saucepan, and stir over high heat until the sugar has dissolved and  the mixture boils. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. If  you use an artificial sweetener, add it to the syrup after it has reached  room temperature.    While the syrup cools, core the cabbage, separate into leaves, and tear  them into bite-size pieces. Peel the carrots and broccoli stems (save  florets for other uses) and slice them thin on the diagonal. Bring 2 quarts  of water to a boil in a 4-quart saucepan. Add the prepared vegetables all  at once, stir, turn off the heat, and let them blanch for 2 minutes; drain,  and spread the vegetables in a shallow layer on a platter to cool.    Sterilize a 1-quart or 1-literjar, pack the vegetables into the jar, fill  to overflowing with the syrup, cover and refrigerate at least a week before  using. They keep for months in the refrigerator.    variation: Add 1 teaspoon of crushed Szechuan peppercorns to the syrup, and  use any firm vegetables you fancy- sliced bell peppers, greenbeans, snow  peas, turnips, and/or radishes.
