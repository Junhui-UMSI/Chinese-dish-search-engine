I made this last week for Shabbas lunch, and it was so delicious I made it  for yesterday also. Pretty easy, but looks very elegant.

Lay the chicken breasts in a baking pan in a single layer, and pour the  sauce over it. Refrigerate for around eight hours. (I only did it for two,  and it came out fine.) Turn the breasts over once during refrigeration.    Bake at 400 for ten minutes, turn them over, and bake for another ten  minutes. Serve garnished with shredded chives, scallions, etc.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #229 by Goldtag1@aol.com on Aug 10, 1997
