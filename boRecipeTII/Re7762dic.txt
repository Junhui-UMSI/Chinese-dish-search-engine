Heat oil in a large skillet.  Add garlic and saute for about 1 minute; then  add mushrooms, pepper strips and onion rings. Saute onver medium heat until  veggies are soft.  Add salt, pepper and cajun seasoning to taste. Serve on  warmed tortillas with your favorite accompaniments. We like, sour cream,  shredded cheese and chopped tomatos.  Maybe a little salsa.  We didnt even  miss the meat.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 18 November 96    Date:    Tue, 19 Nov 1996 13:00:02 -0500    From:    Amy Smalley <as5x@AVERY.MED.VIRGINIA.EDU>
