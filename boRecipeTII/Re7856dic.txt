I saw this in Bon Appetit yesterday and decided to keep it. Ill bet a  dollar to a doughnut that the recipe originally called for Linguica, but  was changed to kielbasa for the masses. If you cant find smoked Linguica  or Kielbasa, Andouille would also be a good substitute. I hope to try this  when it gets cooler (like October -- grin)! Hope it appeals to you, too.    Number of Servings:   8    Combine all ingredients in large pot.  Bring to boil, stirring  occasionally.  Reduce heat; simmer until thick, stirring occasionally,  about 2 hours.  Season with pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead;  refrigerate.  Rewarm before serving.)    Recipe from Bentons Restaurant, Florence, South Carolina. Courtesy of Bon  Appetit, July, 1991.    Posted by Shelley Rodgers.
