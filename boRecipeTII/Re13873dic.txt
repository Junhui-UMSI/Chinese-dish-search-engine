Wash  spinach in plenty of cold water; if sandy, wash the second time, then spin  dry. (or dy on paper toweling. And water left on the leaves will help it to  wilt quickly.) Heat oil in large saute pan over medium-heat. Add garlic and  lemon juice. Saute for 1 minute.  Turn heat to high. Add spinach, 1/4 ts  salt and a few pinches of pepper. Wilt spinach, tossing with tongs to coat  leaves with hot oil and garlic. Toss in pine nuts. Add more salt and pepper  if DISIRED. Serve immeduately.    TO TOAST PINE NUTS: The nuts can burn quickly, so keep eye on the pan.  Place nuts in dry skillet and toast them over very low dry skillet and  toast them over very low heat, stirring or shaking the pan as needed until  theyre golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
