Rinse chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, combine wine, oil, lemon juice,  herbs, salt and pepper. Add chicken breasts, cover and marinate overnight.  Cook on an outdoor grill, basting occasionally with remaining marinade.  This can also be baked in a 350 F. oven for one hour, basting several  times. Serve with a Greek salad and a loaf of crust bread. Serves 6.

I substituted Greek Retzina wine  for the roditis. Everyone said it was the moist and delicious.  Recipe by: Opaa! Greek Cooking, Detroit Style, by George J.
