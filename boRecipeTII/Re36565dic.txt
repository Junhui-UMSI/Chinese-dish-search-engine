For the compotes, remove all leaves from rhubarb and discard them. Rinse  and string rhubarb, and cut in length if very thick. Cut into 2 to 3-inch  long pieces. Set aside refrigerated. Rinse and hull strawberries and place  in a heat proof bowl. Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a  boil, stirring occasionally. Pour syrup over strawberries. Allow to stand  at room temperature about 1 hour, until berries are softened. Drain most of  the syrup from the berries and return it to the pan. Return syrup to a boil  and add rhubarb. Cover and remove from heat. Allow rhubarb to stand until  cooled. Add strawberries, pour into a non-reactive bowl and refrigerate,  covered until needed.    For the sugared almonds, place in a heavy roasting pan. Whisk the egg white  and pour it on the almonds. Rub the almonds between the palms of your hands  to coat them evenly with the egg white. Add the sugar and stir with a  rubber spatula so that the sugar adheres to all the sliced almonds.    Bake the almonds, stirring every 5 minutes, for about 25 minutes, until  they are evenly golden and the sugar crust has adhered well. Cool the  almonds in the pan.    To serve the compote, spoon it into small glass dishes and top with a  spoonful of the sugared almonds.
