Bbq Pasties
Carrot, Pulled pork, Rutabaga, Frozen pie shells, Thyme, Salt and pepper, Onion, Potatoes, Sage, 
I just replaced the meat in the pasty recipe with pulled pork. It gave it a  nice smokiness and with the BBQ sauce, it was great. I like flakey crusts  and hate rolling pastry dough, so I use frozen pie shells. I get one pasty  out of each shell. This makes 4 pasties.    Mix all ingredients and put 1/4 in each pie shell. Fold the pastry over the  filling to make half-moon shaped pies. Seal the edges and cut a couple of  small slits on the top. Bake on a cookie sheet at 375F for 30 to 35  minutes, then reduce heat to 350F and bake 15 more minutes.    Serve with BBQ sauce and a Strohs. Ya, sure, you betcha.
