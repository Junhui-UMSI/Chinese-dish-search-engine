ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2288    Preheat the deep-fat fryer. For the salad: In a mixing bowl, combine all  the ingredients together.    For the soft-shells: To clean, remove the tail, gills, and eyes. Season  with salt and pepper. For the tempura batter: Whisk all the ingredients  resulting in a smooth batter. Season with salt and pepper. Dip the  soft-shell into the tempura batter, shaking off any excess. Remove the  basket from the fryer. First, carefully holding the top of the soft-shell,  drag the legs through the oil first, for 1 minute. This will allow the  individual legs to fry separately instead together. Then lay the  soft-shell, top side down, into the oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until  golden, flip the soft-shell over and continue frying for additional 2-3  minutes. Remove from the fryer and allow to drain on a paper-lined plate.  To assemble, mound the salad in the center of the platter. Arrange the  soft-shell around the salad. Drizzle the gastrique over the entire platter.  Garnish with the chopped peanuts, chopped chives, Essence and long chives.
