Stuffed Peppers in the Microwave
Seeded), Hamburger (lean or 22%), Onion (chopped fine), Rice (cooked), Bell Peppers -- (halved,, Salt and Pepper (to taste), Garlic (minced), Tomato sauce (8oz), 
Place the four halves of the peppers in a glass pie plate, with about 1/8  cup of water. Cook them on high for 5 minutes.    Meanwhile; mix the hamburger with 1/3 can of tomato sauce, add salt and  pepper and rice. Get your hands in there and mix well.    Remove peppers from microwave, and drain all except 1 Tbsp of water from  dish. Turn peppers so the cup is up and fill with the H/B mixture.    Cook on high in microwave, for 7 minutes, then pour the remaining tomato  sauce over the top and cook for 5 minutes more.    NOTE: You can use cracker crumbs or dried bread cubes if you want. Margie  usually covers the stuffed peppers with a sheet of plastic wrap when she  cooks it, and I dont. Hers (covered) come out with a moist top and mine  come out with a crusty top.    You can use Cambells tomato soup instead of tomato sauce, but if you do cut  the salt down.    To cook in a conventional oven, bake at 350 degrees F. covered for 45  minutes, then uncover and cook an additional 15 minutes.
