Add corn, pintos, tomatoes, and seasonings. Stir well and simmer 10 to 15  minutes. Season to taste with salt (not me, said the fish). Remove from  heat.    Bring 5 cups water to rolling boil in heavy saucepan. Slowly pour cornmeal  into water in thin, steady stream, stirring continuously to avoid lumping.  Add salt (whatever) and cook over very low heat, covered, 20 minutes,  stirring occasionally.    Preheat oven to 375.    Oil shallow, 2 quart baking dish and line bottom with half of the cooked  cornmeal. Pour over it the skillet mixture and sprinkle with the optional  grated cheese. Top with remaining cornmeal, patting it in smoothly. Bake  for 45 to 50 minutes, or until cornmeal is golden brown and crusty. Let  stand 10 minutes, then serve.    My only problem is that the first time I serve this from the oven, the  bottom is very moist - well, wet. However, on warm-up, this seems to  resolve itself. And guess what, its good even when more moist than one had  hoped for.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #012, by Tara Strasser <tara@gvn.net> on  Mon, 13 Jan 97.
