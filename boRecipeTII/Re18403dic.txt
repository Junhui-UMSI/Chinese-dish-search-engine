So Im sending along some of favorite foods my Mom used to fix in the 40s  and 50s. Her name is Veva.    Boil the first 10 ingredients for 10 minutes. Cool and add remaining  ingredients.    Pour into 3 bread loaf pans (greased) and set them on a cooky sheet to keep  the raisins from burning and bake about 1 hr. at 350 F. Better when kept  over a long period of time.
