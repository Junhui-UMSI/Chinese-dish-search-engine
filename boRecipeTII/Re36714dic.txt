Strawberry Frozen Yogurt
Gelatin, Sieved frozen Strawberries, milk, Whipping cream, whipped, Plain yogurt, Sugar, Salt, Lemon juice, 
Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir  until gelatin is completely dissolved.   Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in berries  and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until foamy. Fold in  whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray. Cover with foil;  freeze.   NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh  strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream maker.  Delicious!
