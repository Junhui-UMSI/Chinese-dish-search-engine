Chop the onion and mushrooms finely.  Saute over low heat in the oil for  about 3 minutes, until tenderized.    Chop the walnuts coarsely.  Grind the sunflower seeds finely.    Add all the rest of the ingredients to the onions and mushrooms, and mix  well.  Transfer to a greased baking dish and bake in a 350 F (180 C)/ Gas  Mark 4 oven for about 45 minutes. Serve with Creamy Gravy (see recipe  below) if desired and seasonal vegetables.    CREAMY GRAVY:  Put the oats, water and oil in a liquidizer and blend  thoroughly.  Pour the mixture into a small saucepan and heat gently,  stirring constantly until it has thickened. Stir in the yeast extract. If  the mixture is too thick add a little more water. (N.B. This can be made  earlier and reheated when serving the roast.)    From: The Single Vegan - by Leah Leneman Typed for you by Karen Mintzias
