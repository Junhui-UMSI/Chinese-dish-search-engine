Pizza on Rye
Parmesan cheese, Sliced mozzarella cheese, Or 6 slices of rye toast, Tomato sauce, Basil, Oregano, 
Mix the tomato sauce, basil and oregano and spread on 5 or 6 slices of rye  toast.  Divide the 8 ounces of sliced mozzarella among the pizzas. Sprinkle  with Parmesan cheese and broil until bubbly. For variety, I top my pizza  with onions, pepperoni, and sometimes canned shrimp.    Randy Rigg    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/kids.zip
