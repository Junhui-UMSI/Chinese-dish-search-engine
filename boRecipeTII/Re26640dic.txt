This is one of the most  popular cakes ever printed in this paper.  The recipe is basically a  doubled Texas sheet cake.  The original recipe, printed in 1983, called for  Moreau chocolate, which is no longer available in Austin or the United  States.  Callebaut, a Belgian chocolate is a good substitute.
