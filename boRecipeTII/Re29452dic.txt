From: TILLIE ELIZABETH HORAK <thorak@welchlink.welch.jhu.edu>    Date: 19 May 1995 20:49:45 -0600  I do cake decorating and the recipe I use is as follows (it usually does  have that thin crust that Patty was looking for):    Cream the shortening and flavorings together.  Then add the sugar, a little  at a time, until the mixture begins to look like coarse crumbs.  Then add  salt water a little at a time until the mixture begins to get smooth and  becomes the consistency of icing.    Cake decorators generally like their icing on the stiff side, but it is a  matter of personal taste.  Add the salt water until it is the consistency  you want.    After you ice the cake, and it sits for a couple of hours, it should have  that "micro-thin" crust your looking for.    As a personal side note, I usually add more liquid vanilla flavoring and  butter flavoring to my icing, because I want the taste, not the terrible  sweetness of some icings.  Almond extract can also be used in place of the  vanilla, if you want to try something a little different.  If you do use  almond, Id use less than the vanilla, because it tends to be a stronger  flavoring.    Note: Van-o-van is a powdered vanilla flavoring that is used (as far as I  know) only by cake decorators.  Every cake decorating store that I have  been in has it in stock. Im not really sure of the significance of it on  the whole, perhaps Wilton could answer that. I do know that if you add more  than what the recipe calls for, it makes your icing bitter. I have run out  of it before and can certainly tell the difference.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
