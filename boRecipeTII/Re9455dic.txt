Pumpkin Biscuits (Lacto)
Flour (half white, half WW), Garlic, Salt, Liquid, Baking Powder, Canned pumpkin (NOT pie, Filling), Skim milk or other form of, Nutmeg, Wheat bran, Wheat germ, 
Combine wet, combine dry, mix wet into dry, drop by generous spoonfuls onto  baking sheet squirted with PAM.  Bake 20-30 minutes at 450 degrees.    The garlic doesnt really give these a pronounced garlic flavor--it just  eliminates some of the cloying sweetness of the pumpkin.  When these first  come out of the oven they are very crisp on the outside and dense and moist  on the inside--sort of like little mini-spoonbreads.  After they cook the  texture becomes more uniform and more like the standard biscuit we all know  and love.    Posted by Kirstin Reade Wilcox <krw3@columbia.edu> to the Fatfree Dig.
