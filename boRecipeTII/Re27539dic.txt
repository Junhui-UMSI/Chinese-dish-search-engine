Thanksgiving Leftover Ideas
These:, You might want to try some, 
1. Turn leftover rolls into bread snacks by brushing both sides with melted  margarine. Then sprinkle with either Italian seasoning or garlic powder &  Parmesan cheese. Bake at 400 degrees for 5 minutes or until brown. 2. You  can also shred all those leftover cheese slices. Put them in a plastic bag  and use for topping for pizza or your next cheese sauce. 3. My favorite is  to take leftover nut bread and cut into thick slices, then cut into finger  slices and dip into thinned leftover frosting and then roll in chopped nuts  or coconut.
