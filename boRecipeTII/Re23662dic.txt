Artichoke Dip Appetizer
marinated artichoke Hearts, Mayonnaise, Cream cheese, Grated Parmesan cheese, Onion, garlic, Mozzarella cheese, pita bread, Chopped, 
The following appetizer is sure to be a crowd pleaser.  I have never taken  it anywhere without being asked for the recipe:    Tear artichokes apart with your fingers.    Cut up pita bread into chip size triangles, seperate and bake on a cookie  sheet until crispy (approx 5 minutes).    Combine all other ingredients and mash (a KitchenAid mixer works great).    Bake in a uncovered casserole dish for approx 30 minutes @ 350 or until  bubbly.    Serve hot out of the oven and scoop up dip with pita bread. If  you  intend  to take  this  to  a  party  or are having friends over be prepared to  recite this recipe a number of times.  My wife and I bring xerox copies  with us!    jbilos@labs-n.bbn.com (John Bilos) Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., Cambridge  MA    Posted to EAT-L Digest - 24 Jun 96    Date:    Tue, 25 Jun 1996 15:19:54 -0700    From:    Garry Howard <g.howard@IX.NETCOM.COM>    Recipe By     : jbilos@labs-n.bbn.com (John Bilos)
