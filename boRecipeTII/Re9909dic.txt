Punjabi Style Spinich/saag
Yellow onion, garlic, Hot pepper, Huldi, Potato, Fresh spinach, Oil, Salt to taste, Chopped, 
First WASH the spinich very well.  Break off ugly parts of leaves and  stems. Peel and cube the potato. Place both in a large saucepan and add  very little water, about 1/4 cup. Let cook on Med temp. until the potatoes  are cooked, adding water when needed and then only a little at a time.    When the potatoes are done, heat another deepsided frying pan.  Add oil,  Pam or saute liquid. When the saute medium is hot add the garlic and onion.  Fry until the onion is translucent. Add salt, hot pepper and huldi. Fry  some more.  The huldi should turn everything yellow.    Incidently, huldi is very good for your stomach, reduces gas when used in  dal recipies.    Fry everything together for about a minute, dont let the onions turn  brown, turn down the heat if needed.    Add the spinich to the onion mixture, stirring constantly but not hard.    Serve with cornmeal roti.    Posted by Rooprai to AOL.    From the recipe files of Sue Smith, SueSmith9@aol.com. Formatted using  1.80?
