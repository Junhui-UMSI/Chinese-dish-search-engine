Pizza Dough #07
(granulated or crumbled), Salt, olive oil, Water (110 deg F), Water (110 deg F), Flour, 
From: bergstro@src.honeywell.com (Pete Bergstrom)    Date: Tue, 8 Mar 1994 18:26:30 GMT  This is my favorite. I got it from the canister of pizza yeast I bought at  Williams-Sonoma, although I dont think the particular brand of yeast is  critical.    Sprinkle 1 Tablespoon (granulated or crumbled) yeast into 1/4 cup of water  at 110 degrees F. Let this rest for 2 minutes before stirring.  In a large  bowl, combine 4 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of salt and the yeast-water  mixture. Add another 1.25 cups of water (110 degrees F) and 0.25 cups olive  oil. Mix and knead for 10 minutes total, then let rise to double its  original size.    I usually get 6 eight-inch pizzas out of a batch of dough (they fit my peel  really nicely). Ive often substituted 1 cup of whole-wheat flour in the  recipe in place of one cup of white flour, although it turns out to be a  tougher crust. (Its good - trust me) I also frequently add about a  Tablespoon of cracked black pepper to the dough. It complements the spicy  sauces I like.
