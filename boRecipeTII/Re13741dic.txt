Wild Rice Salad with Sun-Dried Tomato - Al Fresca
Wild rice, Salt and pepper, Pitted black olives --, Pine nuts -- or more, Sliced, Parsley, Sun-dried tomatoes --, Chopped, olive oil, Red wine vinegar, 
Cook the rice in an abundant amount of boiling salted water in a large pot  for 35 to 45 minutes or until the grains have almost doubled in size and  are tender, but still chewy. Drain the rice in a sieve and run cold water  over to cool. Drain thoroughly. Toast the pine nuts lightly (dry skillet)  until tan. Let the nuts cool. Combine the drained wild rice in a bowl with  pine nuts, tomatoes, olives, etc. Toss gently to mix.    (odd that cheese is not listed!?!)
