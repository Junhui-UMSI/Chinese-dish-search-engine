In work bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade, combine the  folours, half the beer, the yeast mixture and salt. Pulse on and off 4  times. Add the remaining beer and process 8 seconds to form an elastic  spongy wet dough.    Spray a large glass or ceramic bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Place  dough in bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover and place in a warm,  draft-free place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.    Sprinkle clean work surface with 1 tablespoon reserved flour and work dough  into a ball. Line a banneton or bowl with a clean non-terrycloth kitchen  towel; sprinkle cloth with remaining tablespoon of flour. Press dough into  bowl; spray lightly with nonstick cooking spray and cover lossely with  plastic wrap. Set aside in a warm, draft-free place to rise until almost  doubled in bulk, but still firm, about 30-40 minutes.    Preheat oven to 450. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and  sprinkle the center with cornmeal. Gently turn the dough out onto the  cornmeal.    Cut an x in the center of the dough with a clean razor blade or the steel  blade of the food processor.
