Jamaican Jerk Spice
Cayenne pepper, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Allspice, Chives, Thyme, Sugar, Dried minced onion, Salt, 
These are some pretty good recipes for chileheads. The original recipes were from Emeril, but I have kicked it UP!   If I had access to Datil Peppers I  think that would be the best!    Combine spices in a bowl by hand or in food processor. Store in an airtight container.
