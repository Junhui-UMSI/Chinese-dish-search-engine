Add 1 cup of the flour, sugar, eggs, baking powder and vanilla. Beat till  combined. Stir in remaining flour and nuts. Divide dough in half. (Can be  done in processor).    Shape each portion into a 9-inch log (should be about 2 inches wide.) Place  about 4 inches apart on lightly greased cookie sheet. For a shinier  appearance, stir together egg yolk and milk/water; brush onto logs. Bake in  375F oven for 25 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheet for 1 hour.    Cut each log diagonally into 1/2-inch slices. Lay slices, cut side down, on  an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in 325F oven for 8 minutes. Turn slices  over; bake 8-10 minutes more or until dry and crisp. Cool on wire rack.    In a double boiler, heat chocolate pieces with shortening over low heat  till melted, stirring occasionally. Dip one end of cooled cookie in  chocolate; dry cookies on rack until chocolate sets up.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
