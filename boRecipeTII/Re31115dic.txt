Place all ingredients (EXCEPT CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND CHERRIES) into the inner  pan in the order listed, select white bread and push "Start." Add the chips  and cherries when the Auto Bakery "beeps," 88 minutes into the cycle. (33  min. with DAK Turbo II) Delightful whether eaten fresh, chilled or toasted,  this soda fountain special is even more spectacular when spread with cream  cheese blended with minced maraschinos and their liquid.
