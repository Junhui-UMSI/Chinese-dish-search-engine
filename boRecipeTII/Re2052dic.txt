Almost No Fuss Stuffed Cabbage
Cabbage, Ground meat; (I make my own, Rice, Chopped parsley, Jar half-fried onions *, salt and pepper, Peeled mashed tomatoes, Juice from 1 lemon, 
* (if you cannot get them, saute half-rings from 3-4 onions until very  light golden, and keep the oil)    Yield: About 15-20 stuffed leaves    1. Wrap cabbage well in microwaveable plastic (the same sort used to cover  dishes). Microwave for 7-10 mins, depends on your microwave power. The  cabbage should soften but not by too cooked. Leave to cool until can be  handled.    2. In a bowl, mix meat with uncooked rice, seasoning and onion. If using  onions from scratch, put into mixture some of the oil used for frying the  onions.    3. Separate carefully cabbage leaves, trying not to wound them. Put aside  about 15-20 leaves. Chop coarsely the rest, and spread at the bottom of a  wide pot.    4. Put 1-2 tbs of meat mixture into each leave. Roll, fold in sides, and  then roll to the end. The idea is that the rolled leaves will be compact,  but not too tight, to make room for rice to expand.    5. Arrange rolled leaves on chopped cabbage in pot. If any mixture is left  over, make meat balls and arrange inside pot as well. If any leaves are  left over, it means you over indulged on filling, nevertheless chop and  fill in pot.    6. Pour over everything can of tomatoes. Cover with water. Cook on very low  heat - the longer the better - at least 11/2 hour. About 1/2 hour before  the end, squeeze juice form 1 lemon (or more if you like) over.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Raya Tarab" <tarab@netvision.net.il> on  Aug 25, 1998,
