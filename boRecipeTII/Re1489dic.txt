Flank Steak/london Broil
Flank steak, BORDELAISE SAUCE, Margarine, Shallots, Red wine, Beef gravy, Lemon juice, Parsley, Salt & cayenne pepper, mushrooms, 
This particular cut of beef is often considered the least choice cut  because so often it is poorly prepared. It is a treat if properly cooked:    preheat broiler. Place roast on a greased broiler rack. Broil within 2  inches of heat - the hotter the better - about 5 minutes on each side. This  will be a rare roast. If cooked medium or well it becomes extremely tough.  Carve in thin slices against the grain.    Serve with a Bordelaise sauce:    Melt 2 tbs. margarine in pot. (when your guest isnt present add 2 tbs.  minced shallots - and cook until transparent - but it wont kill the sauce  to leave them out). Add red wine and simmer until reduced by half. Add beef  gravy (you can used canned), lemon juice, minced parsley, Salt & cayenne  pepper to taste, and sliced mushrooms (saute them before adding in a little  margarine or oil)    I think you guest will be quite impressed!
