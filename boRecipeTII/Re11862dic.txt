Rbs Pale Ale
Hallertauer hops (finish), Ale yeast, English 2-row malt, Crystal malt, Fuggles hops (boil), 
Youll get good yield and lots of flavor from English malt and a 1-stage  150 degree mash. In the boil, I added the finishing hops in  increments:  1/4  ounce  in last 30 minutes, 1/4 ounce in last 15  minutes,  and  1/4  ounce at the end (steep 15 minutes) dont have to be Fuggles; almost any  boiling  hops  will do, I usually mix Northern Brewer  with  Fuggles  or  Goldings  (just make sure you get .12-.15 alpha). Conversion  will  pro-  bably  only take 60 minutes rather than 90. Depending on when  you  stop  the mash your gravity may vary as high as 1.050. Thats a lot of body! This  is  a simple all-grain recipe for a good pale ale  that  lets  the beginner  concentrate  on the mashing process. Hallertauer  may  not  be traditional  for ales, but neither is a modern piano for sonatas.  But  I think  Beethoven himself would have used one if he had one.
