Sweet-And-Pungent Sauce #1
Vinegar, Water, Sugar, Water, Soy sauce, Cornstarch, 
1. Bring water to a boil. Add sugar, stirring, and cook another minute to  dissolve. Add vinegar; cook 1 minute more.     2. Meanwhile blend cornstarch, soy sauce and remaining cold water to a  paste. Then stir in to thicken. Pour sauce over deep-fried meat or fish and  serve.     NOTE: Sweet-and-pungent sauces, because of their vinegar content, are best  prepared in enamel pans. Their color can be enhanced by the addition of 2  tablespoons tomato sauce or 1/2 teaspoon red food coloring.     VARIATIONS:     1. For the sugar, use brown sugar or honey.     2. For the vinegar, use cider vinegar.     3. For the soy sauce, use heavy soy sauce.     4. For the water in step 1, substitute stock. Or use equal parts of water  and tomato juice; or water and pineapple juice; or pineapple juice and  tomato juice.     5. After step 1, add any of the following:        1 to 2 tablespoons sherry     1 to 2 tablespoons catsup or tomato sauce        1 tablespoon molasses         2 garlic cloves, minced        1 scallion stalk, minced      1/4 teaspoon salt        1/4 teaspoon Tabasco Sauce    few drops of Worcestershire Sauce        few drops of sesame oil       1 teaspoon ginger juice        juice of 1/2 lemon            1/2 cup subgum ginger, sliced        1/2 cup sweet mixed pickles, shredded     6. Omit the cornstarch paste in step 2. Instead, combine the cornstarch  with the water in step 1 before heating it. Then cook, stirring, to thicken  as the sugar and vinegar are added.
