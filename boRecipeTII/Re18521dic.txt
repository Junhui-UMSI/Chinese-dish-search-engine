1. Fry bacon in a large, deep heavy pot over medium heat. When the bacon  has rendered most of its fat, remove the pieces with a slotted spoon, drain  on paper toweling and reserve.    2. Add the onions and garlic to the bacon fat and cook until the onions are  translucent.    3. Add the pork and beef to the pot. Break up any lumps with a fork and  cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly  browned.    4. Stir in the remaining ingredients except the beans and the bacon. Bring  to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2 hours. Stir  occasionally.    5. Taste and adjust seasonings. Stir in the beans and the bacon, and simmer  for 1/2 hour longer.
