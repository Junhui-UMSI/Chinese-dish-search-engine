Practically Fat-Free Pumpkin Rice Pudding
Arborio rice, Raisins, Salt, pured pumpkin, canned, Water, cinnamon, Sugar, Ground ginger, Ground nutmeg, 
In a heavy, large saucepan, bring water to a boil and add the rice. Boil,  uncovered, for 7 minutes; drain well.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In the same saucepan, bring the milk to a boil  over medium high heat, stirring occasionally. Add the vanilla bean, rice,  and salt. Cook, uncovered, over medium-low heat, stirring often, until rice  is very soft and absorbs most of the milk, 15-18 minutes. Remove from heat,  remove vanilla bean, and stir in sugar.    In a large bowl, mix pumpkin with half (2 cups) of the rice pudding. Add  cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Spoon pumpkin rice pudding into a buttered 2  quart baking pan (Ill use a quick spray of Pam). Mix raisins into white  rice mixture. Spoon it over the pumpkin mixture. Bake, uncovered, 30  minutes, or until firm. Serve warm, sprinkled with cinnamon if desired.    Serves 4-6.
