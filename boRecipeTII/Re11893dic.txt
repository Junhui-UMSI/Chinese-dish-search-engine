Then the next day you add all the  other ingredients and return to the refrigerator until ready to serve. It  can be served over "Tostadas" "Nachos" or over a lettuce leaf. You may add  some Tabasco if you like. Tastes great!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
