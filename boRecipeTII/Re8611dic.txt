Potatoes with Yogurt
Finely chopped parsley, Greaseproof paper, Lemon juice, Salt and pepper, Butter, Yogurt, Red pepper; finely chopped, Butter, Potatoes, Scallion (green part only), 
Boil the potatoes 30 minutes with their skins (they should not be too  soft). Remove peel from potatoes while they are still hot, cut potatoes  into small cubes, then saute them in the butter and add salt and pepper to  taste. In a bowl, stir together the yogurt, lemon juice, parsley and only  the green stalk of the scallion (finely chopped). Add the red pepper, then  mix in the potatoes. Butter a large piece of greaseproof paper and place  the potatoes in the middle of it. Seal the paper around the potatoes, and  put it on a baking pan in a preheated 190 C oven and bake for about 15  minutes. Unwrap the "package" onto a platter and serve immediately.
