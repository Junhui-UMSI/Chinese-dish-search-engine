Chocolate Pudding in a Mug
Cornstarch, Cocoa powder, Sugar, Skim milk, Vanilla, 
Arthur Schwartz, NY Daily News, 9/19/1990 (really)    In a large mug (at least 12 oz) dissolve cornstarch, cocoa, and sugar in  milk. Microwave on high for 90 sec or until mixture boils (see below). Stir  in vanilla. Chill in refrigerator at least 1 hour.    Notes:    ** I use a pyrex measuring cup instead of a mug. This way I can watch that  the pudding doesnt boil over.    ** It takes longer than 90 min with my microwave. I usually nuke it for 1  min, stir, nuke for 30 sec, stir and nuke again in three 30 min intervals  watching through the door to stop and stir when it starts to overflow. I  want the total nuking time to be at least 60 seconds *after* it first boils  so that the cornstarch is completely cooked through.    ** After youve made it once or twice you can adjust the cocoa and sugar to  suit your tastes. Eg. I find that when I use Dutch processed (dark) cocoa,  I need only 1 T of cocoa powder.    Posted to fatfree digest by Barbara Heller <barb@altoetting-online.de> on  Oct 21, 1998,
