Preparing the Gnocchi: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place rinsed  potatoes on a bed of rock salt and bake until dry and fluffy, approximately  40 minutes. While hot, peel potatoes and run through a food mill. Add eggs,  seasonings, and flour, reserving 1/4 cup of flour in which to roll the  gnocchi. Roll into a smooth airy dough; do not over-work it. Roll by hand  into 1/2 inch cylinders. Cut into one inch pieces on a floured surface and  roll each piece over the back of a fork to make shell - shaped gnocchi.  Blanch in simmering, unsalted water and cook for two minutes or until they  float for 30 seconds. Remove from water and reserve.    Preparing the Wild Mushrooms and Parmigiano: Clean and rinse all mushrooms  and pat dry. Heat a heavy saute pan with extra virgin olive oil and saute  the mushrooms vigorously at high heat. Add shallots and garlic; saute.  Deglaze with chicken stock, season, reduce and finish with Parmigiano and  chives. Garnish dish with shaved Parmigiano and chive sticks.
