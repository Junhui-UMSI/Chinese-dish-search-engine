For a 10-12 pound turkey. Mash potatoes with 3/4 cup warmed milk. Melt the  butter over medium heat in a wide skillet. Add onion and cook, stirring  often, until it is limp and starting to turn gold. Stir in the celery so  its covered with butter and remove pan from the heat. Combine the pan  contents with remaining ingredients: taste and adjust seasonings. Old  recipes call for as much as three times this much butter and cream in the  potatoes, so feel free.    Recipe by: Dressed Birds? Stuffed Birds?
