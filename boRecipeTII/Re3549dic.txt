Wild rice, Long-grain white rice, Dry white wine, Pecan halves, toasted, Chopped mint (opt), Water, Coarsely chopped, Butter, Shallot, minced, Chopped parsley, Beef stock, Hot pepper sauce, Bay leaf, Frozen peas, thawed, 
1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot;  cook for 2 min. Stir in the wild rice and the water, and heat to boiling.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 30 min.    2. Add the white rice, beef stock, wine, bay leaf, and hot pepper sauce to  the wild rice. Heat to boiling, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer,  covered, until both rices are tender and almost all the liquid has been  absorbed, about 25 min. Discard the bay leaf. Stir the peas into the rice  mixture; cook, covered, for 5 min more. Remove the cover and raise the heat  slightly if the mixture is too wet. Add the parsley and pecan, and sprinkle  with mint, if desired.    Note: To toast the pecan, heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add the  pecans and toast until golden, stirring frequently, for 6-8 min.
