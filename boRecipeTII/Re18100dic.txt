Here is one of my favorite party recipes.    This is a refreshingly different type of salad. I normally double this  recipe and serve on a buffet for a party. Its always very popular. If you  make more then you can eat at one meal just don?t mix it all of it with the  lettuce and it will store for days.    In a large bowl, combine mayo, cheese, basil and salt. Add broccoli,  cauliflower, onion and chestnuts. Refrigerate overnight.    Just before serving place cut up lettuce in a bowl and cover with the  veggie mixture. Sprinkle with bacon and serve.
