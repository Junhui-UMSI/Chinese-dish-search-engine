Sweet sauces with pork or game are classic.  This one combines a little  sweetness with the acidity of vinegar for a delightfully different taste.  Serve it with that Easter ham for rave reviews. Prepare this sauce no more  than two days in advance and refrigerate it. Rewarm over low heat before  serving.    In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and mustard in the vinegar. Place the  mixture in a medium-size heavy saucepan, and add the brown sauce and simmer  over low heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the raisins and simmer 5 minutes  longer.  Serve hot.    Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.    From The Complete Book Of Sauces by Sallie Y. Williams
