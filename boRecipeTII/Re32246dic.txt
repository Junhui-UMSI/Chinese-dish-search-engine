Mix the ingredients together and soak the swordfish steak in it for  2 hours before cooking.  Brush or baste the fish with the sauce during the  broiling.  Serve with braised kidney beans, a hearty salad of greens,  tomatoes, and onion rings, and a red wine.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.
