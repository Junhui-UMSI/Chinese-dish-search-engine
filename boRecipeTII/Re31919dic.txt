Have been using recipes from "Dr. Bergers Immune Power Diet" exploring the  possibility that my childhood food allergies havent subsided but at age 50  are just expressing themselves differently. Here are some of the barley  recipes. Cooked barley instead of oatmeal for breakfast. With fresh peaches  just now coming into the farmers market their addition to a bowl of hot  barley is great. No need to add anything else.    Place all ingredients in a bowl, toss and season to taste. Chill for at  least 1 hour. Stir once. Tabouleh Salad can be chilled for up to 2 days.
