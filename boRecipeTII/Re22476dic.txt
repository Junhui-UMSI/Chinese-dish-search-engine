1.To prepare greens, strip leaves from each stem. Submerge leaves in a sink  full of cold water, swirl gently, then allow to rest briefly on the surface  before lifting out of water to drain. Repeat with fresh water until no dirt  remains in bottom of sink. Stack leaves in piles and chop into bite-sized  pieces.    2. In a 2 or 3 quart saucepan or deep skillet, combine greens with thyme,  onion, celery, carrots, mushrooms, beans and stock. Bring to a boil, cover,  and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until greens are tender, about 10 to  20 minutes depending on greens. Season to taste with salt or miso and  pepper. Dissolve miso first in a small bowl of the hot soup liquid before  adding to the soup. Stir in lemon juice. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes.    Variation1: Puree half the beans before adding to soup for a creamier  consistency.    >DELICIOUS!
