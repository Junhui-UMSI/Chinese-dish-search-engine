Quick Muffins or Loaf Bread
Baking Powder, I make a quick muffins or, Crushed pineapple, Flour, Sugar; up to 1/2, Eggs; up to 2, 
You could also add 1t vanilla, 1/4c grapenuts, 1/4t salt. For a splurge  1/4c sliced almonds, but then it wouldnt be fat free. Bake at usual temps  and time, 350 at 20 minutes for muffins, approximately. I think Ill go  make some now! See if I can come up with a new variation.    I forgot! 1-2 eggs.    Sometimes I add dry milk also.    Sorry about the egg oversight.  Posted to fatfree digest by getout@earthlink.net on May 30, 1998
