Pork Medallions in Creamy Sage and Onion Sauce
Grandma McGuigans, Pork medallions, Cream of mushroom soup,, 
Brown pork medallions - pour sauce over and bake 350? for about 30 minutes.    NOTES : Now this is a tricky one ! The sauce I made from a bottled sauce we  USED to be able to get here in Canada but I havent seen it for ages (I  liked it so much that I bought 6 bottles at one time but am almost out of  it) - it was called Grandma McGuigans Sage and Onion Sauce put out by a  Canadian Company Presidents Choice - they are still making all their  other sauces, but this one maybe didnt make the grade in the consumer  world and thus they have quit making/marketing it - ANYWAY I dont know  what can be used to replace Grandma McGuigans, but maybe if one were to  take some finely chopped    onions and saute them in butter, add some sage and then the mushroom soup -  you may get a similar result - that is what I will try when I use the last  of my Grandma McGuigans !!! -- Barb MC formatted 1/24/97 by  MsRooby@msn.com  Recipe by: Barb Bain, bain@mail.agt.net    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #386 by "Rooby " <MsRooby@msn.com> on Jan 25,  97.
