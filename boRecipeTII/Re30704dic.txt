Tamarind, About
***  NON   NE *****, 
Tamarid juice - Tamarind paste, in the form of small blocks, is available  in packets in Asian grocery stores.    To make the juice, place a small portion of the tamarind in a bowl of warm  water and let it soak for about 20 minutes. When the water has colored,  squeeze the pulp, discarding any seeds, and throw it away. The thick brown  liquid is used as a souring agent in Indian curries.    Tamarind paste is also available in a concentrate, which may be substituted  for fresh tamarind.    When neither form of tamarind is available, fresh lemon juice may be used  instead.
