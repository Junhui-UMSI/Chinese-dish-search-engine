(Are you listening Gretchen and Angie???  :)    I am embarrassed to say that this comes from the booklet which came with  the bread machine. I thought I had lost it in my last move, but just found  it and made a loaf. My previous attempts to convert recipes have been  dismal failures, but at least I got this one right!!!    BTW, this is quite a high-rising loaf - I made the one pound version in my  machine (which makes 1.5 pound loaves), and it was almost as high as my  regular 1.5 pound loaves.  So, start with the one-pounder.    Also, although the booklet doesnt say to, I always mix the dry ingredients  together first (except for the yeast), then add them pre-mixed.  That way I  am sure the gluten is evenly distributed throughout the flour.    Add ingredients in order according to manufacturer.  Bake on regular cycle  (approx 2 1/2 hours in my machine)    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #41    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
