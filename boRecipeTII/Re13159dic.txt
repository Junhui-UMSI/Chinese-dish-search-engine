Wonton Cannoli
Pure vanilla extract, unsalted pistachios, semisweet chocolate, Mint, Ricotta cheese, Peanut oil, Wonton skins, FILLING, 
Heat oil in deep fryer to 375. Work with 6 wonton skins at a time. Keep  remainder well wrapped in waxed paper and draped with lightly dampened  towel. Place a wonton skin on work surface and set a cannoli tube  diagonally across center of it. If you dont have a cannoli tube, form a  tube with some aluminum foil. Bring sides of skin up over tube. Seal  overlapping tips with a dab of water. Form wonton skins around remaining 5  tubes. Cook, 2 tubes at a time, seam side down in hot oil, for 30 seconds  or just until golden. Remove with tongs and drain on paper toweling. While  shells are still hot, gently push them off tubes with a small metal spatula  and your fingers. Repeat with remaining skins and be sure tubes cool  completely before wrapping with skins.    Filling: Combine ricotta, confectioners sugar, Vanilla and chocolate.  Cover and chill 2 hours or overnight. To serve: spoon filling into cannoli  shells. A pastry bag will be very helpful here, or cut a corner off of a  sandwich bag and squeeze the mixture out of it. Dip each end of filling in  pistachios. Arrange on serving plate. Sift additional sugar over each and  garnish with mint sprigs.
