Saute onions & pepper in a little vegetable stock & water till tender  (about 8 mins). Add tomatoes, beans, salsa & corn. Add the spices and  simmer while you get the topping ready.    {Original recipe called for 3 or 4 tablespoons of oil and 1 whole egg in  the batter. I increased the milk slightly, added about 1/2 more teaspoon of  baking powder and used just the egg white}    Sift together dry ingredients. Beat egg white & milk. Stir into flour &  cornmeal mixture - dont overmix. Fold in the corn kernels, and spread  batter over bean mixture and bake at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.    I serve this with plain yogurt {reduced fat, cant get fatfree around my  neck of the woods} & extra salsa on the side.    Posted by Janet Hatch <janet.hatch@acadiau.ca> to the Fatfree Dig.
