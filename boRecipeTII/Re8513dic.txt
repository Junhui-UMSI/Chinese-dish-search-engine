Potato-Sorrel Soup
Chives, Crme frache, Black Pepper, Salt, Water, Leek whites, sorrel leaves, Butter, Red potatoes, 
This is a rather rustic soup. For a more refined version, pass it through a  food mill before serving.    MELT THE BUTTER IN A SOUP POT and add 1/2 cup water. Add the leeks, sorrel  and salt, then cook gently, covered, for 5 minutes over medium-low heat.  Add the potatoes and cook another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then  pour in the rest of the water and gradually bring the soup to a boil. Lower  the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Once  the potatoes are soft, help break them down by pressing them against the  side of the pan, making the soup as rough or smooth as you like. Or, if you  prefer, pass the soup through a food mill. Taste the soup for salt and add  more, if necessary. Serve with freshly ground pepper, a spoonful of creme  fraiche swirled in and a delicate sprinkling of chives over the top. If  youve got garden chives and theyre in bloom, separate the individual  flowers at the base and sprinkle on a few along with the green stems.
