A couple of days before you will cook this, put a block of tofu in the  freezer in a freezer container.    About 24 hours before you cook, take the tofu out of the freezer. Pour the  vegetable broth over it, and put it in the refridgerator to marinate. Once  the tofu has thawed, cut it into slices and return to the marinade for at  least a few more hours.    When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan. Take the slices of  tofu out of the marinade and dredge in wheat flour. Then fry until golden  brown, turn and fry the other side. Place on a dish and set aside.    In the same saucepan, add more oil and the water. Add the mushrooms, green  onions, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper and saute until the mushrooms are  soft.    Mix the wine, soymilk, and cornstarch together until there are no lumps.  Add to the saucepan and stir until mixture thickens. Then carefully place  the tofu slices back in the saucepan. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer  about a minute.    Serve the tofu slices with the mushroom mixture on top. Serve with a  steamed green vegetable, such as asparagus, and a french-style bread.
