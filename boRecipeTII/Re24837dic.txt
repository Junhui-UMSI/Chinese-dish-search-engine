1.  Cream together the margarine and sugar.    2.  Add the vanilla, flour and nuts.    3.  Note: If you can stick your finger into the dough and it comes out  clean you have enough flour!  If you have to add flour do so carefully as  these are not good if too much flour is used!!    4.  Shape the dough into crescents and bake at 350 degrees F on your oven.    5.  Roll the completed cookies in the powdered sugar when they have cooled  down.  BE CAREFUL;  These are delicate!!!
