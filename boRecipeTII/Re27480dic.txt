Tofu "Mayonnaise"
Mustard, Vinegar, Lite Tofu, 
A mayonnaise substitute: I use Mori-Nu lite tofu mixed with some vinegar  and mustard.  I beleive there is a recipe for eggless egg salad and you can  glean the recipe for the mayonaisse out of it. It is what I do instead. You  might give it a try. It works for me.    From: Barbara Zimmerman <barbara@crl.com>. Fatfree Digest [Volume 9 Issue  50] Aug. 10, 1994.
