submitted by: esther@rochgte.fidonet.org (Esther H. Vail, Rochester NY USA)  This is a nice old-fashioned dish which many consider the ultimate comfort  food--I used to make it for my children when they were ill.  Made by this  recipe it is incredibly rich, but very innocent in its flavoring, and full  of an intense wonderful taste of chicken. But I warn you that the use of  low-fat margarine and skim milk would make it pointless to serve. Instead,  do it just once a year and really enjoy it.    Cook chicken wings with salt and water to cover until they disintegrate.  Throw the wings away (or dismember and give your cats the meat). Boil the  broth down to two cups and strain. Cool overnight and next day remove all  but a tablespoon of fat from the top of the jellied broth. Bring the broth  to the boil in a covered pot, reduce heat to a simmer, and add the chicken  breasts.    NOTE: do not add to boiling broth, because that will toughen the chicken.  Simmer covered very gently over low heat about twenty minutes; remove one  breast and cut into it to see if its done. Continue simmering a bit longer  if necessary. Remove chicken and keep closely covered so it wont dry out  while you prepare the sauce. Add the butter to the broth. Combine cream and  flour (I shake them together in a covered jar) and stir gradually into the  broth. Cook this sauce mixture gently, stirring frequently, until thickened  (this will be like a thin white sauce). Meanwhile, cut the chicken breasts  into bite-size cubes. Add to completed sauce and allow to heat gently for a  minute or so, and serve over split biscuits.
