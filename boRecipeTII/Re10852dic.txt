It is a delicious sweet way to add alternative grains  to your diet.    rinse 1 cup quinoa and simmer in 2 cups water for about 20 minutes, or  until all water is absorbed. Add apple juice, dried dates, dried apples,  dried apricots, and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer, cook and stir for about 10  minutes.  Chill.    Experiment with other flavors of juice and other dried/fresh fruits.    fatfree digest V96 #190    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
