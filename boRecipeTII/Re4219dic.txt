skinned     Slice the peaches and add all the other ingredients.    Check for taste and adjust.  Let massirate for about 1/2 hour while you  make the crumb topping.  Assemble and bake at 375 degrees for about 1 hr.   Place pie plate on a cookie sheet to avoid spill-overs. Crumb Topping. Put  3/4 C flour, 1/2 stk butter-in slicec, and 1/2 cup sugar in FP, and give it  short quick zaps until it resembles tiny peas. Sprinkle on peaches. Crust:  I use the recipe on the Crisco label. When Im in a hurry I use a frozen  crust.  AGAIN THIS WAS ALWAYS MADE WITH PEACHES FROM STYERS.
