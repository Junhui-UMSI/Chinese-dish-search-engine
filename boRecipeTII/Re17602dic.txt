Almond Joy Candy
Chocolate, unsweetened, Salt, Coconut, shredded, Almonds, salted, Condensed milk, sweetened, Vanilla, 
Preheat oven to 350F. In top of double boiler, combine condensed milk,  chocolate and salt. Cook over rapidly boiling water; stirring often, for 5  to 7 minutes, or till until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir in  vanilla and coconut. Form cookies by dropping teaspoons of mixture on well  greased baking sheet, 1" apart. Top each with a whole almond. Bake on  middle sheet of oven for 10-12 minutes, watching cookies carefully after  8-9 minutes,as the bottom can get too brown. Immediately remove cookies  from pan with metal spatula and cool on wax peper covered rack.    These taste a bit like the chocolate bars; hence the name. They freeze  well. from _Heartland: The Best of the Old and the New from Midwest  Kitchens_
