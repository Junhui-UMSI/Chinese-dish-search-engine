Bake while eating dinner and it will be ready by the time you are ready for  desert. This is great hot, but it does not make good leftovers so eat it  all.    If using Fresh Apples core and dice the apples mix with a few raisins and 1  tab apple pie spice. If using Fresh peaches just peal and slice thin.
