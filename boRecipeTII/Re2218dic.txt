Baked Bean

This is my fav -- from John Robbins book _May All Be Fed_. I made some  changes and doubled the recipe.    Put everything in a crockpot, adding water to cover and cook on High for  5-6 hours. They get very thick cooked this way.    Can also be baked covered in an oven @ 300 F. for 1 1/2 hours *after*  simmering the beans in water for 45 min to 1 1/2 hours. Drain beans and  place in large baking dish, add all other ingredients plus enough of the  cooking liquid to barely cover the beans.    These are good. Sometimes I add a few tablespoons of Bacos while cooking in  the crockpot. If you find these too sweet, just cut down on the sweeteners.
