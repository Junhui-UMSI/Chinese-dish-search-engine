Trout Sauteed in Walnut Oil
A little flour, Salt and pepper, Sherry, Walnut oil, Trout fillets, Walnuts, 
Toast the nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking the pan  often, for about 5 minutes.  Set aside.  Wipe the skillet with paper  towels.    Dust the fish fillets with flour and shake off the excess.  Heat  just enough oil to film generously the bottom of the skillet.  Add the  fish, season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat until  pale gold on both sides, turning once.  Remove the fish to a warm  dish.  Pour the vinegar into the pan, stirring to melt any browned  bits, add the toasted nuts and spoon evenly over the fish.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mm-trout.zip
