For Champagne Cabbage:  ======================         Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat  and add onion and sugar.  Cook, stirring constantly, until lightly  golden (about 5 minutes.)         Add cabbage and toss for 3 minutes.         Add remaining ingredients and lower heat to medium.  Cook,  uncovered, until cabbage is just tender and liquid is nearly absorbed  (20 to 25 minutes.)         Adjust seasonings to taste.  Cover and keep warm until served.
