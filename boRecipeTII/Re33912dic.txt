Sweet and Spicy Couscous Salad
Canola oil, Fine sea salt, green beans, Currants, Carrot, Red bell pepper, Fresh-squeezed lemon juice, Ground cinnamon, Couscous, Cayenne pepper, Tamari-roasted almonds, fresh mint, Red onion, OPTIONAL, Fresh-squeezed orange juice, Canola oil, Water, 
Put the currants, orange juice, lemon juice, 1/3 cup oil, cinnamon, salt,  and cayenne in a jar.  Cover with the lid and shake until the ingredients  are well mixed.    In a medium saucepan, bring the water and 1 tablespoon oil to a boil. Stir  in the couscous.  Immediately remove from the heat, cover, and let stand  until the water is absorbed, about 6 minutes. Transfer the couscous to a  large bowl, and fluff with a fork.  Cool completely.    Put 1 inch of water in a large saucepan with a steamer basket, cover with  the lid, and bring to a gentle boil. Put the carrot, green beans, and bell  pepper in the steamer basket, cover with the steamer (lid? ~K.M.), and  steam until the vegetables are a bright color, about 3 minutes. Remove the  steamed vegetables from the basket; they should still have a crunch. Rinse  under cold water, drain, and cool completely.    Stir the steamed vegetables, onion, and mint into the couscous. Shake the  Spicy Currant Dressing and pour it over the salad. Stir until well coated.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Sprinkle  the toasted almonds over the top just before serving and serve chilled. (If  the salad is prepared more than a few hours ahead, adjust the seasonings  before serving.)
