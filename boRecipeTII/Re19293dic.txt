Vegetable Soup - Thick
Frozen mixed vegetables, Kosher Vegetable soup mix, Pepper, Potato, cubed, Onion, large dice, Soup meat or bones or both, Parsnips, sliced, Water, Salt, Butternut squash, cubed, Sugar, Sweet potato, cubed, Turnip, cubed, 
In large soup pot, combine meat with water to cover. Add salt, pepper, and  sugar. Bring to a boil and remove scum that comes to top. Reduce heat and  add all the vegetables and the mixes. Taste and adjust the seasonings while  it is cooking. Let simmer about 3 hours and enjoy. You really cannot  overcook this.    You can add any other veggies that you like or have. While preparing for  the super bowl, I threw in the stems of the broccoli that I was using for  the dip. It is a great opportunity to empty all those little plastic  containers in the fridge that have small amounts of left over veggies in  them.
