Pinapple Cheese Ball
Seasoned salt, pecans, Onions, Green Pepper, Cream Cheese, crushed pineapple, 
While cream cheese is softening, drain the pineapple in a sieve. It must be  very dry or the ball will be hard to work with.    Mix cheese with dry pineapple, green pepper, onion, seasoned salt and one  cup of the pecans. Place in the refrigerator, cover with saran wrap  overnight to allow to harden.    With a spatula force the cheese up into the shape of a ball.  Place the  remaining cup of pecans on a sheet of waxed paper and roll the ball shape  out onto them, rolling and shaping the ball as you cover the entire ball  with pecans. Place on a large platter and surround with half slices of  sliced pineapple or just crackers.
