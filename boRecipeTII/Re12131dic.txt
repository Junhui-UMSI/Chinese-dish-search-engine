Zucchini and Cheese Fritatta
Eggs, Black Pepper, zucchini, olive oil, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Wash, but do not peel, the zucchini. Cut into 1/4 inch slices and cook  slowly in the oil until just tender.    Beat the eggs with the pepper and pour gently over the the zucchini. Cook  until just set.    Sprinkle the cheese on top and place under the broiler to brown lightly.  The top will become puffy. Let the fritatta stand for a minute or two, and  then cut into wedges and serve.
