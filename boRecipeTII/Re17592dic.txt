Almond Horns
Almond extract, Finely chopped blanched, Egg whites, Sugar, 
(*) To blanch almonds, dip almonds into boiling water for 1 minute. Remove  the brown skin covering. Dry in a 200F oven for 30-45 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Use a food processor to chop them to the finest size  possible. (A 2-pound bag of almonds is what youll need for this recipe).    Preheat oven to 300F. Combine all of the ingredients thoroughly. Form into  desired shapes and sizes (we usually form them into crescents) and bake on  greased and floured cookie sheets. Bake for 20-30 minutes depending on  thickness of cookie. (In my oven, it takes about 24 minutes).    NOTES : This recipe is a double recipe.  These are one of my favorite  cookies--I just LOVE almonds!
