Vietnamese Dipping Sauce
Sugar, fresh pineapple, Garlic, Rice vinegar, Fresh Lemon Juice, Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish), Mam nem (anchovy sauce), Fresh red chili pepper, 
For anchovy lovers, here are a couple of variations for a Vietnamese  dipping sauce made with em.  This is traditionally served with Beef  Fondue with Vinegar (Bo Nhung Giam) that is part of the Vietnamese  feast called Bo Bay Mon (Beef in seven ways++seven distinct ways of  preparing beef). Its good with other stuff too but can be a bit  strong to Western tastes. Some restaurants have it but you might have  to ask for it. This is by far the most intricate of sauces in the  Vietnamese culinary repertoire. What makes it so special is the use  of a condiment called mam nem, prepared from ground fresh anchovies  and salt and fermented over a period of time. It can become  dangerously addictive. Traditionally, mam nem is served as a dipping  sauce for barbecued or fried fish. In general it goes well with  grilled foods.  It is an essential sauce fro Beef Fondue with Vinegar.    Use only fresh pineapple and remember to shake the bottle of anchovy  sauce thoroughly before using.  Anchovy cream may be substituted.    Over a bowl, squeeze the pineapple between your hands to extract as  much juice as possible.  Combine the pulp and juice and set aside.  Into a bowl, strain the anchovy sauce through a very fine sieve,  pressing on th solids with a spoon to extract all of the liquid.  Discard the solids.    Pound or crush the garlic, chile and sugar to a fine paste in a bowl.  Stir in the pineapple mixture, strained anchovy sauce, lemon juice,  vinegar an fish sauce.  Stir to blend.    Yield: 1 1/3 cups    VARIATION: If you are unable to find mam nem sauce, here is a  variation of the above recipe, using canned anchovies. Add pineapple,  if desired. 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 fresh red chili pepper, seeded  2 tablespoons sugar 2 cans (2 ounces each) flat anchovies, drained  1/4 cup nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2  tablespoons pineapple or water    Combine the garlic, chile and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound  to a fine paste.  Add the anchovies and mash to a very smooth paste.  Stir in the fish sauce, lemon juice and pineapple juice.  Mix well.    Yield: about 1 cup.    From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier.
