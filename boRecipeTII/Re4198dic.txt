Perfect Chinese Steamed Rice
Uncooked long-grain rice, Water, 
PUT THE RICE INTO A LARGE BOWL and wash it in several changes of water  until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put in a heavy pot with the  water and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until most of the surface  liquid has evaporated. This should take about 15 to 20 minutes. The surface  of the rice should have small indentations like a pitted crater. At this  point, cover the pot with a very tight-fitting lid, turn the heat as low as  possible and let the rice cook undisturbed for 15 to 20 minutes. There is  no need to fluff the rice before serving it.
