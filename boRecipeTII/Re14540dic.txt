"Faux" Fettucini Alfredo Sauce
Sour cream, Grated Parmesan cheese, Parsley flakes, Butter, Egg yolk, 
From: FranKOFK@aol.com    Date: Mon, 15 Jul 1996 10:57:46 -0400  On a very low flame, heat up the butter and sour cream and parsley flakes  until combined.  Heat until hot but not boiling. Remove from flame and  immediately stir in slightly beaten egg yolk and cheese.    This recipe, on further analysis, is too difficult for a person on  crutches. Have your children make it.
