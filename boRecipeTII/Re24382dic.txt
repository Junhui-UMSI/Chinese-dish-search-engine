On a floured board, make a well with the 2 cups of flour. Add water to well  and make dough by traditional well method. Knead 10 minutes and allow to  rest 10 minutes.    Place 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. In a 12 to 14inch  saute pan, heat oil until just smoking. Add onion and cook until softened  but not browned, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggplant and zucchini and cook  until softened and light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and  pepper, remove from heat, and set aside.    Roll dough into 1inch dowel and cut off a inch piece. To form pointed  semicurl, first roll forward on pasta to form small pencil and then  backward 30 degrees to the left to form squiggle. Continue with remaining  dough. When ready to serve, place squiggles of pasta (trofie) into water  and cook until they float. Drain well and toss into pan with eggplant. Add  pesto and toss over medium heat until well coated and warmed through. Serve  immediately with grated cheese.
