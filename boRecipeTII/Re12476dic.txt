By  hand mix in the flour, baking powder and salt, then the milk, stirring  after each addition only enough to combine. Press the pastry smoothly over  the bottom and sides of the pan, brush with the egg wash and set aside.  Filling: If the plums seem juicy, scatter the bread crumbs over the pastry.  Arrange the plums skin side down on the pastry shell in rows, fanning the  quarters out an overlapping the plums slightly. ( If using canned, arrange  hollow side down in cocentric circles) Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar.  Set the tart on a baking sheet and bake in the lower portion of the oven  for 40 to 45 min, untiul the pastry is GD&B (Golden Brown & Delicious) and  the filling bubbly.
