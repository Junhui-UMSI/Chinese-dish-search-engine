Packed light brown sugar, salt, Unsifted all-purpose flour, Butter, Pecans, Crust, FILLING, Butter, Cream cheese, Egg, 
Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 25 minutes     1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ready 2 miniature muffin tins with cups  that measure about 2 inches across and 7/8 inch deep.     2. For crust, beat butter with cream cheese until smooth. Add flour and  mix until a dough forms. Divide into 24 balls. With your fingers, press  each ball into an ungreased muffin cup, taking care to make a smooth, even  layer over the bottom and up the sides.     3. For filling, whisk egg in a medium bowl. Add sugar, butter and salt and  mix well.     4. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon chopped pecans into each crust. Add filling so  it comes almost to the top of the cups, making sure it doesnt spill over.  Sprinkle remaining pecans over the top.     5. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 250 degrees and continue to bake until  crust is light brown at the edges, 10 minutes. Cool. When muffin tin is  cool enough to handle, loosen cups from the sides of the tin and carefully  transfer to a wire rack. Cool to room temperature.
