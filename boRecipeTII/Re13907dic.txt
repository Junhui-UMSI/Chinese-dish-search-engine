Wine Biscuits
Salt, Sugar, Shortening; (Oleo), Sherry; To 1/3 C,Or Any Wine, Egg, Flour, 
Prepare as you would for regular biscuits, that is: combine dry ingredients  and cut in oleo. combine egg and sherry and mix in to form a soft dough.  Pat out on a floured surface. cut with biscuit cutter, place on baking  sheets and sprinkle with a bit of sugar or flour. bake 350, 8 to 10  minutes. Makes about 12 small. Note: I have used white wine with good  results too.    Joan,"Flour Power" >From: LIR119@delphi.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
