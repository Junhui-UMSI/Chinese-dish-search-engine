From: theriot@ug.eds.com (DOROTHY THERIOT - EDS/UG HELPDESK)    Date: 15 Nov 93 13:30:49 GMT    I grew up in New Orleans, and I always make Pralines at Christmas for my  west coast friends......    1. Combine sugar and milk in a saucepan, bring to a boil and continue to  cook until a drop forms in a soft ball in cold water, stirring often.    2. Add butter and pecans; bring back to soft-ball stage while stirring  constantly.    3. Remove from heat, add vanilla and beat until mixture begins to thicken.    4. Drop by teaspoon on wax paper. Makes about 30 pralines.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
