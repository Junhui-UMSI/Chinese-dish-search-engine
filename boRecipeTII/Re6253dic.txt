Pizzocheri with Potatoes and Leeks
Garlic clove, smashed, Yukon potato or boiling, Salt, Unsalted butter, Thinly sliced clean leeks, Fontina cheese, cut into, Dried packed Pizzocheri, Salt, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub the bottom of a gratin dish with the  garlic and then discard. Lavishly butter the bottom of the gratin dish with        2    tablespoons of the butter.    In a pot of salted boiling water cook the leeks and potatoes for 5 minutes.  If you are using dried pasta, add it to the pot and cook for 5 minutes or  until it is almost cooked, but not thoroughly. (If you are using a fresh  dough, then cook for 2 minutes only. Pasta must remain firm because it  continues to cook in the oven). Drain the potatoes, leeks and pasta and  divide in two. Place half in the bottom of baking dish and season with salt  and pepper. Dot with 2 tablespoons butter, half of Fontina cheese and half  of Parmesan. Layer with remaining pasta, potatoes and leeks. Season with  salt and pepper and top with Fontina and Parmesan. Dot with remaining  butter and bake for 5 minutes only, until cheeses have melted and dish is  bubbling hot. Serve immediately.
