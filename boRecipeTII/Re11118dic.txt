first when you add raisins the bread wont rise as high and when you add  bran or other types of flour bread wont rise as high.   I take it this recipe came with the book. I have made hundreds of loaves  of raisins bread and not one has been the same. I change something each  time. This is my favorite. I hope you like this. I also like the sourdough  raisin bread replace 1 cup of water with starter also take 5 cardamom seeds  and take out of pod add whole leave out the oatmeal or add more water.
