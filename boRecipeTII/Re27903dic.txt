Third Bread
Yeast, Bread flour, Yellow cornmeal, FOR 11/2 LB. LOAF, Honey, Rye flour, Warm Water; Very Warm, Salt, 
Put ingredients into pan in the order listed, select white bread and push  start.    NOTE: Using  two flours and a meal, this is called third bread and was  found in many old cookbooks. It is a light, honey colored bread. It will  sink a bit in the middle, but has a chewy crust and a sweet, very  satisfying flavor.
