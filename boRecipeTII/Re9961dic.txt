Place peas & water in large, heavy saucepan, bring water to boil, boil  peas for 2 minutes, turn off heat, let stand 1 hour.    2. Heat a nonstick skillet (or use broth or other liquid), add onion,  garlic, carrots, and celery and cook stirring for about 5 minutes. Add to  soaked peas.    3. Add broth, tamari, pepper, dill, and liquid smoke. Bring to boil, reduce  to low, and simmer soup, partially covering pan for about 1 1/2 hours. Stir  occassionally to avoid scorching and add water if needed.    4. In a blender or food processor, puree the soup, thinning to desired  consistency w/broth or milk. Heat before serving.  The book says it makes  about 8 servings, but that depends upon your appetite.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #106    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
