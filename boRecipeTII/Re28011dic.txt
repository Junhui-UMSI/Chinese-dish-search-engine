Baked Chicken Breasts with Horseradish Cream Sauce
Cornstarch, milk, Water, Dijon mustard, White wine vinegar, Boneless chicken breast, horseradish, Nonfat yogurt, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium size saucepan, heat milk over  medium heat. Add corn starch dissolved in water or white wine and bring to  a boil, stirring, until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in  horseradish, yogurt, sugar, mustard, and vinegar. Season with salt and  pepper. Arrange chicken breasts in a casserole dish. Pour sauce over top  and bake, covered, for 40-45 minutes. Horseradish cream sauce is also good  on swordfish or shark, cooking time is only 20-30 minutes, depending on  thickness of fish. Use skim milk and its almost completely nonfat, with  only about 8 grams of fat coming from the chicken breast.
