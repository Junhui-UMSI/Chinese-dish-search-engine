Caramelized Onions
Sweet Onions; Note 1, Butter; Note 2, Nonfat Veg Chicken Broth;, 
Note 1: Vidalia or other sweet onions (approx 2 1/2 lbs), 3 - 4" in  diameter, stem and root ends removed, peeled and left whole    Note 2: Original recipe used 1/2 C (1 stick) butter or margarine    Note 3: Original recipe used one 10 oz can chicken or vegetable broth    Place the onions, butter and broth in a crock pot and cook on low 12-24  hours until the onions are deep golden brown and very soft. Different crock  pots will take different amounts of time. it?s almost impossible to  overcook this, so go for the deepest brown. Use the onions and liquid to  flavor soup, stock, and stews. they make a wonderful addition to risotto, a  perfect pasta sauce, and the world?s best pizza topping (drain off the  liquid first).    I left in some of the butter so it would give the onions a more full, rich  flavor.    These are so easy to caramelize this way.
