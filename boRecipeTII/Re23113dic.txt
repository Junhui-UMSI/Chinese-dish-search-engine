Tu Bshevat Fruitcake
Flour, Dried fruit, Eggs, Mixed nuts: Almonds,, Brown sugar, Baking Powder, 
Heres a recipe I found on the Virtual Jerusalem www page on the Tu  BShevat link. The recipe is credited to MILAH, Ulpan Yerushalayim. Baking  time and specific types of dried fruit were not listed.    Mix it all. Pour into greased loaf pan. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven  until brown. Stick a toothpick in center to check. If it comes out clean,  your cake is cake.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #001    From: seaco@ix.netcom.com    Date: Thu, 2 Jan 1997 14:56:46 -0800
