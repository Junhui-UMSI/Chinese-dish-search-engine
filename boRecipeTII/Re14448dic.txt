Salt, Baking soda, Buttermilk, Honey, Egg, Whole wheat flour, Baking Powder, Walnuts, Butter or Margarine, Raisins, 
Combine egg, milk, honey and butter. Combine all dry ingredients and stir  into egg mixture. Stir in nuts and raisins. Divide mixture into 2 greased 6  x 3 inch loaf pans. Bake 400 degrees 50 minutes or done. cool before  slicing.    Ive had this recipe a long time. It makes a satisfying bread although it  is essentially a quick bread. This is in response for a good non yeast  bread.    Joan,"Flour Power"    >From: LIR119@delphi.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
