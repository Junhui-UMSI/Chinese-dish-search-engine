Pineapple Fruit Salad
Syrup:, Fruit Salad:, Cream, Sugar, Lemon, Baby pineapple, Red apple, To serve:, Grand Marnier, Lemon, fresh fruit, 
First make the syrup: mix the lemon juice and sugar in a small pan and  simmer for 5 minutes, making sure the sugar dissolves completely. Stir in  the Grand Marnier.    Prepare the fruit for the fruit salad and toss in the syrup. Cut the  pineapple in half vertically, including the leaves. Scoop out the flesh  from each pineapple half with a grapefruit knife, ensuring that the flesh  remains in one piece.    Put the fruit salad with the syrup in the pineapple shells. Slice the  pineapple flesh and the red apple, dipping the red apple slices in lemon  juice to prevent discolouration, then arrange alternate slices of pine-  apple and red apple on top of the fruit salad in the pineapple shells.  Serve fresh cream separately.
