From a recent Sunday newspaper supplement, Parade. Its delicious! Bette    1. Place broth and 3/4 tsp salt in large saucepan; bring to boil. Stir in  couscous, cover, and remove from heat. Let stand 5 minutes. Uncover, fluff  with fork and set aside.    2. Meanwhile, saute carrots, bell peppers, red onion, zucchini and garlic  in large heavy pot over medium-low heat; cook, stirring for 5 minutes.    3. Stir in beans, cumin, curry, and red-pepper flakes. Season with salt and  pepper. Fold in reserved couscous and parsley.    MY NOTES: Eliminated salt in couscous because broth has more than enough.  Eliminated salt and pepper at end because red-pepper and curry made it  spicy enough for me. Used about 1/4 cup dried parsley in place of fresh.  Make couscous in smallish pot (about 4 cupper is enough). Saute veggies in  Dutch-oven sized pot so that you have room to fold in the couscous. My  biggest frying pan was too small to maneuver.
