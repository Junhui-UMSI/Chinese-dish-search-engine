Place a rack in the highest position and preheat the oven broiler.    Combine the cauliflower, onion, garlic, and butter in a mixing bowl.  Transfer the cauliflower mixture to a baking sheet and broil for 10  minutes, or until the edges of the florets are blackened. Set aside to  cool.    In a large pot over high heat, saute the oil, tomatillos, and jalapenos for  5 minutes, stirring often. Add the stock, bring to a boil, let boil 5  minutes, then decrease the heat and simmer.    Add the spinach and cilantro and let simmer 10 minutes. Add the  caulillower. Puree with a handheld blender until smooth. Season to taste  with salt. Let simmer 5 minutes.    Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and serve.    Central Americans often cook with cauliflower, but they dont usually make  soup with it. Most commonly, they pickle it with vinegar and serve it as an  accompaniment for all kinds of dishes. This recipe is very interesting  because it calls for roasting the cauliflower, which gives it a completely  different flavor than were used to. I like to keep this soup as green as  possible and thats why I puree the spinach at the very end.    >from ISBN 0-89815-851-6 Ten Speed: (C) 1997 Douglas Rodriguez.
