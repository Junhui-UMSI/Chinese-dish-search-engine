Heat oven 400 degrees. Lightly spray large cookie sheet with nonstick  cooking spray or grease lightly. Handle the dough gently. Over mixing  scones can make them tough. Combine flour, wheat germ, baking powder,  spices, baking soda and salt (if using). Cut in margarine until  mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add combined apple, milk and honey,  mixing just until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto  lightly floured surface; knead gently 5 to 6 times. Pat dough into  9-inch circle. Mix together topping ingredients. Sprinkle over dough.  Cut dough into 10 wedges. Place 1/2-inch apart on prepared cookie  sheet. Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until light golden brown.
