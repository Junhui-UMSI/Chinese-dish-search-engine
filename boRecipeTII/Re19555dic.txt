TB milk    In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter, beat in the sugar,  a little at a time, & beat the mixture until it is light & fluffy.  Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, beat  the mixture until it is thick & pale, & beat in the anise extract.

Halve the dough & with floured hands pat each half into a  14-by-4 inch rectangle on a buttered baking sheet. Brush the  rectangles well with the egg wash & bake them in the upper third of a  preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown  & a skewer comes out clean. Cut the rectangles crosswise diagonally  into 3/4 inch slices, turn the slices on their sides and bake them in  the 375F oven for 5 minutes. Turn the slices & bake them for 5  minutes more. Let the slices cool on racks & store them in airtight  containers. Makes about 34 biscotti.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
