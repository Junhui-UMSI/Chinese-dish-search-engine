Whipped Chicken Potatoes
Fresh chives; chopped, Salt/pepper to taste, More parmesan cheese-topping, olive oil, carole rock tstw72b, Chicken broth; or more, Russet baking potatoes, Parmesan cheese, 
Boil potatoes till tender, skin and mash. Add chicken broth, oil, 3/4 cup  parmesan cheese, and using an electric mixer, beat till smooth (adding more  broth if needed). Stir in chives and season to your taste with salt and  pepper. I did it this far the day ahead, and then when I was ready to  serve, I sprinkled more parmesan cheese on top, baked it 30 minutes at  350~, and browned under the broiler. WHOOPS.....I baked it all in a glass 9  x 13" pan...Ive also made it using leftover chicken, chopped fine and  mixed in; or adding crisp bacon to it. This is so adaptable, you can use  your imagination. Carole Comments: This mashed potato recipe uses chicken  broth instead of milk for thinning, plus parmesan cheese and chives for  additional flavor. Its another great "make-ahead" youll love.
