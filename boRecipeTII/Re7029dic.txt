Preheat oven to 350. Cook spinach according to package directions and drain  well. Combine spinach with remaining ingredients, mixing well. Roll into  walnut-sized balls. Bake at 350 on ungreased cookie sheet for 20 minutes.  These can be frozen before cooking. Without thawing, bake at 350 for 30  minutes. Serve hot or cold. Fun in lunches.
