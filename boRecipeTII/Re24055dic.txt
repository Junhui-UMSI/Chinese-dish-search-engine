** See recipe for Clarified Butter.    For Lobster Butter:  ===================         Steam or boil lobsters until just tender, 8 to 10 minutes.         Cool, then remove all lobster meat from shells.  Refrigerate  meat, covered; set aside.         In large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons clarified butter.  Add  onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, tarragon, and bay leaf; toss  over high heat 3 minutes.         Add lobster shells, stirring; then add 2 tablespoons Cognac and  stir for 3 minutes.         Add butter and tomato paste and simmer gently, covered, 2 to 3  hours.         Strain, pressing solids firmly.  Set aside for 15 minutes.         Skim any froth from surface and strain again through several  layers of dampened cheesecloth, leaving behind any milky residue in  bottom of pan (discard residue.) Cool, then chill or freeze in small  containers.    For Lotte and Sauce:  ====================         Pat lotte dry; sprinkle with salt and pepper.         Heat 1/2 cup clarified butter in heavy large skillet over medium  high heat.  Working in batches if necessary, saute lotte until lightly  golden, about 2 minutes per side.  Scatter shallot around fish and  cook 2 minutes longer.         Pour in 1/2 cup Cognac and cook 1 minute longer.  Transfer to  warm serving plates and keep warm.         Add 1 cup cream to skillet and reduce by half.         Add remaining cup and boil until thick enough to coat a spoon  lightly.  Lower heat and spoon in the 1/2 cup lobster butter a little  at a time, whisking constantly.         Strain sauce into clean saucepan.  Cut reserved lobster meat into  thick slices and add.  Simmer gently 2 minutes.         Place lobster pieces between pieces of lotte.  Nap with sauce;  garnish with parsley and serve immediately.
