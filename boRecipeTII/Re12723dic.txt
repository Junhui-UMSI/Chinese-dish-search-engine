Yorkshire Pudding #6
Salt, Beef drippings, milk, Plain flour, Eggs, Water, 
Called my father-in-law (in Sydney) on Christmas Day and told him what we  had had for dinner. "Thats very Australian!" he exclaimed.  "That was the  whole point," I replied. :-) Anyhow, heres the menu with recipes and  comments (all recipes were taken from the Australian cookbook Manda gave  me): Prawn salad(*), Standing rib roast, Yorkshire pudding(*), Roast  potatoes and butternut squash, Stir fried broccoli and snow peas,  Pavlova(*). (Ones marked * are in this cookbook.)    Make a batter wiht the flour, salt, eggs and milk, beating well until  smooth then beat in the water. Refrigerate until ready to cook and beat  again just before using. Heat tin (it specified muffin tins but I used an  8-inch round pan) in a hot oven with 1 teaspoon drippings in each one. When  smoking hot, pour in the batter, fillign cups about 2/3 full. Return to a  hot oven and bake for 20 minutes (dont peek), then reduce heat so they  dnt burn and allow to dry out for an extra 10 minutes.    Now this was really good, but it fell scant minutes after I had taken it  out of the oven. Is there a way to prevent this, or do you just have to  serve and eat it 3 seconds after it comes out of the oven?    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /MISC    From rec.food.cooking archives.
