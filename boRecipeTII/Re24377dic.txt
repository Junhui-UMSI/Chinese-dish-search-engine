Trishs Lazy Black Beans n Rice Recipe
Progresso beans  , white long-cooking rice, (no salt necessary with the Other seasoning), Pepper, Garlic, Cajun seasoning, Salsa, Chives, 
Cook the rice (adding saffron if desired).  Being Southern, I usually  cooking it about 30 minutes to get it good and sticky!    In another pot, cook the black beans, adding Tony Chacheres, pepper and  garlic to taste.    Serve in large bowls - rice, topped with black beans, topped with a "nest"  of salsa and chives.    This is my favorite quick and easy recipe, bar none.    From: Trish Rucker <trish_r@mind.org>. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10 Issue 29],  Sept. 9, 1994.
