White Clam Sauce a la Peggy
olive oil, Oregano, Fresh parsley; minced, Fresh basil leaves; coarsely, 6 oz cans chopped clams, Linguine or angel hair, Dry white wine, Lemon; juiced, Garlic, Bottles clam juice; 8 oz., 
Heat the garlic very gently in the oil to a golden brown. Add the clam  juice, the lemon juice, the wine, oregano, and heat thoroughly about 20  minutes; keep hot.    In the mean time, cook the pasta al dente. A moment before you drain your  pasta, add the basil and the clams to the hot clam mixture. (If you add the  clams sooner they will get tough). Drain the pasta and put it in a hot  serving bowl, along with half the liquid, then make individual servings.  Now ladle generous heapings of the clam filled sauce on the individual  servings so they wont be searching for the clams.    >From the book by Dom DeLuise "Eat This... Itll Make You Feel Better!", p.  130. 641.5945 DELUISE.    NOTES : We make this without the wine or bottled clam juice (but using the  juice in the canned clams).  This is wonderful.  We use it over spaghetti  or fettuccini noodles (cut down to 2 servings).  Recipe by: Dom DeLuise "Eat This... Itll Make You Feel Better!    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1062 by "Russell J.
