Source: Best of the Bake-off (1957 Grand Prize Winner!)    Heat oven to 325F. Fold 1 sheet of foil in half lengthwise. Fold the  double- thickness foil crosswise into 1-inch pleats to make an  "accordion-pleated" pan. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat with  second sheet of foil.    In a large bowl, beat margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Add  vanilla and eggs; beat well. Add flour and salt; mix well. Stir in walnuts.  Drop 1 rounded teaspoon of dough into each fold of foil. (Dough spreads  during baking to form 4 1/2 to 5 inch long cookies.)    Bake at 325F for 18 to 26 minutes or until golden brown. Remove cookies  from foil; cool completely. Turn foil over for second baking.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by syschwartz@juno.com (Sarah J Schwartz) on  Dec 1, 1998,
