Flaky Pie Crust
Salt, Sugar, unsalted butter, vegetable shortening, water, All purpose flour, Cake flour, 
Note:  Water produces a crisper pie crust that milk. Using milk will make a  more tender crust.    On a warm or humid day, this dough may require less liquid than on a cool  dry day.  Double the ingredients for a double crust.    Mix flour, cake flour, salt and sugar in a food processor. Add the cold  butter and shortening and process with about six pulses, until the mixture  forms pea size lumps.  With the machine still running, add three  tablespoons of water or milk and process until large moist chumps form and  the dough holds together.    If the dough is too dry, add more water or milk by teaspoonful.    Gather the dough into a ball.  Flatten it into a disk.  Wrap in plastic  wrap and refrigerate for one hour before rolling it out.
