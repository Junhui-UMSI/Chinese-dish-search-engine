In a large mixing bowl, combine the sweet potatoes with the sugars,  margarine and sour cream; beat until blended.    3. Add egg substitute and evaporated milk. Mix well. Combine flour, baking  powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt in a separate bowl. Add to potato  mixture and mix until smooth. Fold in raisins.    4. Fill muffin cups almost to the top and bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until  tops are rounded and muffins pull away from the sides of the cups.    5. Unmold the muffins and cool on a rack for a few minutes before serving.    Note: Two medium sweet potatoes equal about 2 cups cooked and mashed  potato.
