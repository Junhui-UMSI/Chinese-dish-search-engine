Tonnarelli W/caper Pesto
Good quality red wine, Capers in salt, rinsed &, Fresh oregano leaves;, Kosher salt, Tomatoes, chopped & peeled, Garlic, Imported dried tonnarelli,, Pecorino or Romano cheese;, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh flat leaf parsley, 
Fill a stockpot with 6 quarts of water, cover and bring to a boil.    In a small saucepan, combine the olive oil and garlic; bring to a boil,  cooking briskly until the garlic is golden.  Remove from heat and let cool;  swirl the pan to hasten the cooling.    Transfer the garlic and oil to a blender or mini-processor.  Add the  tomato, capers and pulse until chopped. Add the parsley and oregano and  pulse until chunky, then add the vinegar.    Add 3 1/2 tablespoons of salt to the boiling water and add the tonnarelli.  Cover partially until water just returns to a boil, then uncover, stir the  pasta and cook until al dente.  Drain the tonnarelli, reserving 1/2 cup of  the pasta water.  Toss the pasta with the caper paste.  If the tonnarelli  is dry, add some of the pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Garnish with  cheese and serve immediately.    Note:  If you cant find capers in salt, you can use brine packed capers,  with these modifications; double the amount called for in the recipe and  add 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt to give them a boost. So as not to overwhelm  their delicate taste, reduce the oregano to 2 tablespoons.
