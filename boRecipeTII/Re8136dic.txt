Potato Chip Sandwich
Potato chips, Mayonnaise, bread, 
You oughtta try the potato chip sandwich from "White Trash Cooking".    Thatll make em sit up and take notice.    Spread the mayo generously across the bread.  Pile the potato chips  on to one of the slices as high as you can.  Then top it with the  other slice and mash down until all the potato chips are crushed.    Paulie Tickette says:  "Wash it down with a Pepsi, its some good!"    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; September 25 1992.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip
