Dissolve the 1 tbsp. sugar in lukewarm water  and sprinkle yeast over it. Let stand 10 minutes. Add yeast mixture to the  cooled (lukewarm) milk. Beat in 3 cups flour until smooth and let rise in a  warm place until bubbly, approx. 1 hour.    Beat egg yolks until light, then add sugar gradually while beating. Add  salt, melted butter and orange rind. Beat egg whites until frothy. Combine  egg yolk mixture and egg whites with the sponge and mix well. Stir in  enough flour to make a very soft dough and knead continually for 15  minutes. When raisins are used, they should be added after dough is  kneaded. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk. Punch  down and let rise as before.    Grease tall round pans generously and coat lightly with dry bread crumbs.  (Coffee or Crisco tins make good containers for Babka.) Form dough into a  ball, small enough to fill 1/3 of a container. Let rise in a warm place  until dough barely reaches the top.    Brush the loaves gently with a beaten egg, diluted with 2 tbsp. water. Bake  in preheated 375 degree F. oven for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature  to 325 degrees F. and bake for 30 minutes. Then again lower temperature to  275 degrees F. and continue baking 10 minutes. The baking period depends on  size of loaves. If Babka is turning dark, cover with aluminum foil.    Remove baked loaves from the oven and let them stand in the pans for 5-10  minutes. Take each loaf out very carefully. Cool completly. Babka is always  sliced in rounds, across the loaf.  Yield: five or six loaves.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
