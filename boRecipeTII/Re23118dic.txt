Tucker Surprise Beef Jerky
Water, Cayenne pepper, Soy sauce, Rump roast, Mesquite smoke, 
Go to the butcher and have them slice a 2 or 3 lb rump roast into slices as  thin as bacon(It sometimes takes a while to convince them that you really  want it as thin as bacon) put soy sauce and mesquite smoke in a gallon size  ziplock bag. if the smoke came in a 4 oz bottle, use the water to rinse the  bottle, pour water into bag. Add pepper. Close bag and let sit for a couple  of hours. Trim all fat from the beef. Add beef to the mixture. Let sit for  5 or 10 minutes(Ive not had any trouble if left overnight) Remove meat  from bag one or two at a time, and lay on trays from dehydrater(Ive never  made it without a dehydrater). Put trays in dehydrater, opening ventsp to  about half. From: Steve Herrick Date: 05-14-92    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Mar 06, 1998
