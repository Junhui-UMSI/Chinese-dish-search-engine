FROM:      Derek Maddox (The Tally System - 912-328-6183 - (1:36)    Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour two 9 inch by 1-1/2 inch cake  pans.    In a double boiler melt the chocolate over hot (not simmering) water,  stirring frequently. Remove from the water.    In a medium bowl lightly combine the egg whites, 1/4 cup milk, and vanilla.    In a large mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients and mix on low speed for  30 seconds to blend. Add the butter and remaining 3/4 cup milk. Mix on low  speed until the dry ingredients are moistened. Increase to medium speed  (high speed if using a hand mixer) and beat for 1-1/2 minutes to aerate and  develop the cakes structure. Scrape down the sides. Gradually add the egg  mixture in 3 batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition to  incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure. Scrape down the  sides. Add the melted chocolate and beat to incorporate.    Scrape the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with a  spatula. The pans will be about 1/2 full. Bake 25 to 35 minutes or until a  tester inserted near the center comes out clean and the cake springs back  when pressed lightly in the center. The cakes should start to shrink from  the sides of the pans only after removal from the oven.    Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 10 minutes. Loosen the sides  with a small metal spatula and invert onto greased wire racks. To prevent  splitting, reinvert so that the tops are up and cool completely before  wrapping airtight.    ** -=> this comes from the bottom of the files of Shelley Rodgers <=-
