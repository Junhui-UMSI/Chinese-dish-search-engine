Cook carrots in  1" boiling water until just tender crisp and drain.  Cook unpeeled potatoes  in 1" boiling water for approximately 15 - 20 minutes. Drain and cut in  half. Place eggplant, carrots, potatoes, zucchini, peppers, onions and  mushrooms in a large plastic bag. Add marinade, seal bag well. Refrigerate  for 2 hours or overnight. Drain vegetables and reserve marinade. Using 8  metal skewers, thread vegetables, alternating varieties. Place on lightly  greased grill, over low heat. Cook, turning often, basting with the  reserved marinade for 10 - 15 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.   Sprinkle lightly with salt before serving.  Remaining marinade can be used  again.  It can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. NOTE: if wooden skewers  are used, soak them in water for 15 - 20 minutes before using. This  prevents the wood from burning.
