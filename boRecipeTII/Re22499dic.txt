Lots of great cakes,  muffins & quickbreads in there. Not to mention actual dinners. It makes me  want to go away for a weekend... This recipe sounds very unusual, but its  suprisingly good.  Not delicious, really, but good." - Lisa    From: Lisa Date: 07-31-96 (18:07) The Polka Dot Cottage, a BBS with a taste  of home.  1-201-822-3627.
