Barbecued Garlic
Springs of Fresh Rosemary *, Heads Garlic, Butter, 
*  Fresh Oregano also may be used.    Place whole heads of garlic, prepared as for Roasted Garlic, on a sheet of  heavy-duty foil.  Top with butter (4 T per 8 Heads) and a few sprigs of fresh rosemary or  oregano.  If fresh herbs are unavailable, substitute dried (2 t of dried  herbs for 8 heads of garlic).  Fold the foil over the garlic and seal the  package well.  Cook over hot coals for about 45 minutes, turning the package occasionally  with tongs.
