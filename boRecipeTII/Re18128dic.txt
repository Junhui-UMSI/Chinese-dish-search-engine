Veloute Sauce
White pepper, Chicken stock, Unsalted butter, Salt, All purpose flour, 
In a heavy bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat until the  foam begins to disappear. Add the flour and cook, stirring to incorporate,  for 3 minutes. Whisk in the stock and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring  constantly. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until thickened to the desired  consistency.    Tomato flavored version:    Combine 1/2 cup tomato puree with 1 1/2 cups veloute sauce. Adjust the  consistency of the sauce with more stock. Finish the sauce by whisking in 2  tablespoons of butter. Garnish with finely diced tomatoes.    Yield: 1 3/4 cups    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9086    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Apr 4, 1998
