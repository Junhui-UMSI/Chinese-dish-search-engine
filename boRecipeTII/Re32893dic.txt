Sweet Red Bean Paste Filling
Red beans, Vegetable shortening, Sugar, Water, 
(sweet red bean paste can be bought in the store, and used straight from  the can for filling, but this is how to make it from scratch)    Place the beans and water in a saucepan, cover, bring to boil over medium  high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 1 1/2 hours, or til beans  are very soft.    Strain the water from the beans, and blend them into a puree in a blender  or food processor.    Press the puree through a sieve, discarding the skins, which will be left  in the sieve.    Place the puree in several layers of cheesecloth, and gently squeeze to  remove excess moisture.    Place the thickened puree back into the saucepan, together with the sugar  and vegetable shortening, and heat over low heat, stirring until it becomes  a thick paste. Stir and scrape vigourously so that it does not stick to the  bottom.    Remove from heat and let cool before filling buns.    Posted to rec.food.recipes by marple@cs.ubc.ca (Kirk Marple) on 1993, .
