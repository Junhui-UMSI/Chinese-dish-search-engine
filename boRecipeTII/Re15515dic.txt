From: sue@ccrwest.org (Susan DeMeritt)    Date: 2 Feb 1995 12:35:04 -0000  For those of you who like fudge and do not like the mess and fuss of  boiling the chocolate down and checking the temp., etc., you will love this  recipe for 5-minute fudge. (I learned this at a Tupperware party about 2-3  years ago). My family loves it.    Mix sugar and coca together thoroughly in large microwavable bowl.  Pour  milk in sugar mixture but do not mix.  Set the stick of margarine right on  top of the mixture. Microwave on high for 2 1/2 minutes. After the mixture  comes out of the microwave, mix well and add vanilla.    If it seems to dry this is when you would add the extra milk if needed.  (However, if it is not too dry do not add extra milk as it will become to  thin and it will not solidify. If for some reason you do add too much milk  and it gets too runny then you can use the mixture on top of ice cream.)    At this point you can add nuts or whatever else you like in your fudge. Put  the fudge out on a plate that is covered with aluminum foil.  Put in the  refrigerator for 20-30 minutes.  It will solidify pretty quickly.
