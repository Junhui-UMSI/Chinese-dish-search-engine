Portobello Mushroom, Tomato, and Basil Sandwiches
French bread, Basil leaves, Tomato, Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Garlic, Portobello mushrooms, Black Pepper, 
Here the only recipe I found myself: from ?Vegetarian Pleasures,  Main-Courses? by Jeanne Lemlin makes 6 (3 1/2-inch) sandwiches    1. Heat 1 Tbsp of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add  the mushrooms and saute until brown and juicy, about 10 minutes.    2. Meanwhile, in a small dish combine the remaining 3 Tbsp oil with the  vinegar and garlic and stir to blend.    3. If the French bread isn?t absolutely fresh and crisp, heat it in the  oven a few minutes, until just hot.    4. To assemble the sandwiches, spread 1/6 of the oil and vinegar mixture on  each half of French bread. On each bottom half of the bread, layer 1/3 of  the mushrooms, tomato slices, and basil leaves. Season with pepper (plus  dried chili flakes or fresh minced chilies) and top with the remaining  bread. Slice the sandwiches in half and serve immediately.    You can grill Portobello mushrooms instead of sauteing them by removing the  stems and brushing both sides with olive oil. Grill them about 3 minutes on  each side. Whether you saute or grill them, you?ll have a knockout of a  sandwich.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #233 by "Eruna Schultheiss"  <eruna@taom.com> on 97.
