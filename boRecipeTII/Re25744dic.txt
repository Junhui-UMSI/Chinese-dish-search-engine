Baba Ghanoush (Aubergines with Tahina)
Tahina paste, garlic, black olives, parsley, Lemons, Ground cumin, Aubergines, Salt, Tomato, 
>From Middle Eastern Food by Claudia Roden    This rich cream is a combination of 2 strong flavours: the smoky one of  aubergines prepared as below, and the strong taste of tahina sharpened by  lemon and garlic. It is exciting and vulgarly seductive. The ingredients  are added almost entirely to taste, the harmony of flavours depending  largely on the size and flavour the aubergines used. The quantities below  give a fairly large amount, enough to be served as a dip at a party.    Cook the aubergines over charcoal or under a gas flame or electricgrill  until the skin blackens and blisters. Peel and wash the aubergines, and  squeeze out as much of the bitter juice as possible. Crush the garlic  cloves with salt. Mash the aubergines with a potato masher or a fork, then  add the crushed garlic and  little more salt, and pound to a smooth, creamy  puree.    Add the tahina paste and lemon juice alternately, beating well or blending  for a few seconds between each addition. Taste and add more salt, lemon  juice, garlic or tahina if you think it is necessary, and if you like, a  little cumin.    Pour the cream into a bowl or a few smaller serving dishes. Garnish with  finely chopped parsley and black olives, oe with Arab or other bread  (pita), as a salad, or as a party dip.
