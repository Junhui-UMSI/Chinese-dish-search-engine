Use dough cycle. Roll dough to 1/4" thickness. Cut with cookie cutters or  knife. Place on baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover with clean  kitchen towels and let rise in warm place about 45 minutes. Bake at  325-degrees for 45 minutes. When all are baked, turn off oven and return  all cookies to cooling oven overnight to harden. Store in airtight  container.    (Using a 3.5" bone shaped cutter, I get about 30-35 cookies from this  recipe. Sam the Wonder Dog adores them.)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdog.zip
