Beat with electric mixer at low speed for one minute, scraping the sides  of the bowl as you mix. Continue beating for another 3 minutes at high  speed. Fold in 2 1/2 more cups of flour. Put 1/4 cup of flour on counter  top or so other flat surface and knead dough 2-3 minutes. If more flour  is needed add small amounts. Grease bowl and top of dough (use butter or  shortening), cover and let rise in a warm place for a minimum of 30  minutes. This recipe will make 5 12" Pizzas of the thin variety or 4 12"  Pizzas if you prefer the thick type. We suggest you try both. If you want  more dough, increase the water by 1/2 cup and the flour by about 1 cup.
