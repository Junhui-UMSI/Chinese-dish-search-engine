This is an easy soup, lowfat and a way to get alot of nutrional value. Can  use other vegetables, depending on whats in season, or if you have a  garden. Bok chow or regular cabbage can be used. To cut up, half head, take  out core, slice thin. In a hot pan add olive oil, add onions, ginger,  lightly saute breifly till you smell the aroma, add carrots. Saute  slightly, add peas, red pepper or yellow pepper on any sweet pepper. Stir,  add bean sprouts and napa cabbage. (fresh baby zucchini makes a nice  addition), add stock. Season sesame oil, just a little, add soy sauce, fish  sauce, stir. Alittle cumin, cayenne (or hot chili sauce, if you have a  asian grocery near by), cracked black pepper to taste. Serve.
