Pat dry on paper toweling, then place  in a large salad bowl. Brown bacon in a skillet and drain on paper  toweling. Stir-fry scallions in drippings 5-8 minutes until tender, mix in  remaining dressing ingredients, and heat, stirring, about 5 minutes. Pour  hot dressing over spinach and toss well. Sprinkle in bacon crumbles, toss  again, and serve.    Recipe is from _The New Doubleday Cookbook_ by Jean Anderson and Elaine  Hanna.    EAT-L Digest 24 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
