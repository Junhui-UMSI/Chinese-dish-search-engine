Rinse the chicken pieces and pat completely dry with paper toweling.  Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside. In a large,  flame-proof casserole dish or a large pot suitable for table service, heat  the oil and garlic clove over moderate heat until the garlic begins to turn  brown. Remove the garlic and discard. Add to the hot oil the chicken, pork,  and ham. Cook until browned evenly, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken  and set aside. To the pork and ham, add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and  garlic. Saute until the onion is translucent and the pepper soft, about 5  minutes. Add the rice, stirring well to absorb liquids. Stir in the tomato  paste. Add the saffron water, the white wine, and the boiling water. Add  salt, about 2 tsp., and fresh ground black pepper, about 1 tsp. to taste.  Return the chicken to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.  Stir in the peas, pimento, olives, shrimp, and parsley. Bring to a boil  again. Immediately reduce the heat, cover, and simmer 20 to 30 minutes or  until the chicken is tender and the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Serve  directly from the casserole or pot. Note: For perfect rice, use 2-1/2 cups  of liquid for each cup of rice. For a richer taste, use chicken stock or  fortify water with chicken base or bouillon cubes.
