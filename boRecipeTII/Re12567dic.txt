Frozen concentrated, Icing sugar, Eggs, Caster sugar, Margarine, Frozen concentrated, Plain yoghurt, Butter, Self-raising flour, 
Cream caster sugar together with margarine. Beat in eggs, then fold in the  flour, yoghurt and 3oz orange juice. Mix well, then divide mixture between  two well-greased cake tins and bake for 30-35 minutes at 190 deg C, until a  knife inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool.    Meanwhile, make the butter icing by first beating the butter until nearly  white, then gradually adding the icing sugar and 2 tbsps orange juice. Use  half of the mixture to sandwich the two cake halves together, and the other  half to spread on top. Enjoy!
