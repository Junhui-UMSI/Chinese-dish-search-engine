Marinade: Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl; marinate chops for at  least 30 minutes turn from time to time.    Lightly dredge the marinated pork chops in 1/4 cup cornstarch. Heat oil in  a large skillet. Pan-fry chops, a few at a time, until they are golden  brown. Drain on paper towels.    Serve hot.    Source: The New Classic Chinese Cookbook by Mai Leung    Suzys Hint: I like to use a plastic zip-type bag for marinating. Its  easier to turn the entire bag from side to side then using a bowl and  turning the meat piece by piece. It also keeps the marinade odor out of the  refrigerator...especially when you use a marinade with garlic.  Additionally, the bag takes up less shelf space than a bowl.
