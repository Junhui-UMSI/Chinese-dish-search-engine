Bring a large pot of water to the boil and have ready a sink full of  icey-cold water. Plunge the shredded cabbage into the boiling water for one  minute then scoop it out and into the cold water.        Drain and dry the cabbage and arrange it and the other vegetables in  sections or concentric rings for maximum decorative value on a large  serving dish. Fill the centre of the arrangement with chicken and ham.  Decorate the dish with bright red chilli "flowers" (optional). Pass the  dressing separately.        From "Raw Materials" by Meryl Constance, Sydney Morning Herald,  12/22/92.       [The chilli "flowers" can be easily made by slitting long, thin, hot  chillies lengthwise from near where the stem attaches and then tossing the  slit chillies into a bowl of ice water and ice cubes. The "petals" will  curl back and make an attractive garnish. Make about eight slits. S.C.]
