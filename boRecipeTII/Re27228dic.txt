Brandy, Egg yolks, Sugar, Mascarpone cheese, softened, Whipped cream or non dairy, Topping- powdered unsweetend, Ladyfingers (2-7 oz pks), Cold espresso coffee, 
Cream yolks and sugar until smooth. Add mascarpone cheese and mix on low  speed for 2 min. Fold in cream (or whipped topping) Combine coffee and  brandy in a bowl. Dip 15 ladyfingers, one by one into brandy mixture and  line up on a platter to make a rectangle about 7 by 13 ". Cover with 1/2  the mascarpone/cream mixture. Repeat with another layer and top with  remaining cream mixture. Sift chocolate on top. With remaining ladyfingers,  cut them in half and arrange arround your rectangle with cut side down. The  cream acts as a "glue". Mrs. G.
