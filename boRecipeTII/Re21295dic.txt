Mold - one 6" clay or plastic flower pot with a hole in the bottom. Line  the pot with a dampened cheesecloth of double thickness. Press cheese  through sieve, or mix it in a blender until smooth. Cream butt and sugar  until light. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time. Press yolk-cream mixture  through sieve. Combine with cheese. Pour mixture into prepared mold. Cover  with cheesecloth and place a saucer top, with a weight on it, so the juice  can drain out. Chill in refrigerator at least 24 hours. Unmold on plate and  garnish with fresh strawberries, pineapple or grapes before serving.  Replace mold on top to store in fridge.
