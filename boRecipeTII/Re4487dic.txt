Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. To make the sauce, cut peppers into small  pieces and place in a blender jar. Add all accumulated juices from the  peppers. Blend to chop. In a small saucepan heat the shallot and garlic in  white wine over medium heat or a few minutes, or until garlic is softened.  Add to the blender jar and blend with the peppers until smooth. Add lemon  juice, chicken broth, cornstarch and cream cheese, and blend on high to mix  well. Pour the blended mixture into a small saucepan over medium heat and  stir constantly for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and  hot. Season with salt and pepper. If the sauce is not completely smooth,  blend again. Coat the fish with an olive-oil spray and season with salt and  pepper. Place filets in a roasting pan, and add 1 cup each white wine and  water. The filets should not be submerged in the liquid. Spread about 1  tbsp. pesto over each filet and drizzle with butter. Roast for 5 to 8  minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Ladle one-fourth the  sauce onto each serving. Place the halibut in the center. Garnish with  fresh cilantro and thin tortilla chips. Yield: 4 servings. Per serving: 491  calories, 12 g fat.
