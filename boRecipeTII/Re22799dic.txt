Apricot Souffles
Dark rum if desired, Cream of tartar, Vanilla, Fresh Lemon Juice, Sugar plus additional for, Dried apricots, Egg whites, Water, 
In a heavy saucepan simmer apricots, water and 1/2 cup sugar, covered, 20  minutes. Transfer hot mixture to a food processor and puree until very  smooth. Force puree through a fine sieve into a bowl and stir in lemon  juice, rum, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Cool puree completely. Puree    may be made 2 days ahead and chilled, covered. Bring puree to room  temperature before proceeding. Transfer puree to a large bowl.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter six 7-ounce (3 1/2 by 1  3/4-inch) ramekins and coat with additional sugar, knocking out excess.    In another large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with a pinch of  salt until foamy. Beat in cream of tartar and beat whites until they hold  soft peaks. Beat in remaining 1/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, and beat  meringue until it just holds stiff peaks. Whisk about one fourth meringue  into puree to lighten and fold in remaining meringue gently but thoroughly.  Ladle batter into ramekins and bake souffles on a baking sheet in middle of  oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until puffed, golden brown and just set in  center.    Remove ramekins from oven. With 2 forks pull open center of each souffle  and pour some creme anglaise into each opening. Serve immediately.
