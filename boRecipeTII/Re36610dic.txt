Strawberry Bundt Cake
-(up to), Eggs, Strawberry preserve, Sugar, Sliced almonds, Butter, evaporated milk, Water, Butter or margarine, Strawberry preserve, All-purpose flour, Salt, STRAWBERRY BUTTER, Active dry yeast, 
Mix 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast. Heat milk, water and  butter to 120-130 degrees. Butter does not need to melt. Add to dry  mixture; beat 2 minutes at medium speed. Add eggs; beat 2 minutes at medium  speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on  lightly floured surface 4 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease  top. Cover; let rise in warm place until almost doubled, about 45-60  minutes.     Punch dough down, divide in half. Roll one half dough to 18x12-inches.  Spread with 1/2 cup strawberry preserves. Roll up from long side, as for  jelly roll. Pinch edges to seal. Place roll, seam side up, in greased  12-cup Bendt pan; seal ends. Repeat with remaining dough and place second  roll seam side down on top in pan; seal ends. Cover; let rise in warm place  until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.     Bake at 350 degrees for 35-45 minutes or until done. To prevent  overbrowning cover with foil after 20 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on  wire rack. If desired, top with confectioners sugar icing and sprinkle  with almonds. Serve with Strawberry Butter.     STRAWBERRY BUTTER: Mix preserves and butter.     NOTE: To save 50% on rising time, use Fleischmanns RapidRise Yeast.  Follow quick mix steps on package back.
