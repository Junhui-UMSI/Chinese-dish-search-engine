After Midnight Drink
See below, 
Put 2 spoonfull of instant coffee & 2 spoonfull of instant cacoa in a  glass with fresh cold milk. Add some cream. It also tastes fine with  a spot of brown rum (I prefer jamaican!) This really pushs you up.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
