From "Fields of Greens" by Annie Somerville (Bantam Books, 1993, $26.95)    First, reduce balsamic vinegar by half in a saucepan over high heat. Set  aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet; add onion, 1/2  teaspoon of salt and a few pinches of pepper. Saute onion over medium heat  until it begins to release its juices, about 4-5 minutes. Add peppers,  garlic and bay leaf; cover and cook very slowly over low heat for about 15  minutes. Set vegetables aside. Remove bay leaf. Preheat oven to 325F. Beat  eggs in a bowl and add onion-pepper mixture, cheeses and basil. Season with  remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few more pinches of pepper. In a 9" saute  pan with an ovenproof handle, heat remaining tablespoon of olive oil to  just below smoking point. Swirl oil around sides of pan to coat it. Turn  heat down to low, then immediately pour frittata mixture into pan. Cook  frittata over low heat for 1-2 minutes, until sides begin to set; transfer  to a 325F. oven and bake, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, until frittata is  golden and firm. Loosen frittata with a spatula. Place a plate over pan,  flip over, and turn frittata out. Brush bottom and sides with reduced  balsamic vinegar and cut into wedges.
