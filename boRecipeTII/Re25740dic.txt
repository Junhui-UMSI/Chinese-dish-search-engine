Baba Ghanoush
Eggplant; (1 lb. total), Lemon juice, olive oil, Soy sauce, Tahini, Cloves Garlic; pressed, 
Prick the eggplant all over and bake it at 350-400 until they collapse  (They should look like prunes) - an hour or more. When they have cooled,  skin them and chop finely, sieving out the large seeds, if preferred. Add  the other ingredients, except the tahini, and whisk well with a wire whisk.  Stir in the tahini and chill well before using. This is good with corn  chips or pita bread.
