Cashews, Brown Sugar, Boiling water, Rice, Long Grain, Raisins, Ghee, milk, Mung Beans, 
1. Rinse and drain the rice. Pick clean the beans and peas. Set aside.    2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the ghee in a large saucepan. Add the mung beans  and split peas and fry, over medium heat, stirring, for 3 minutes or until  very lightly colored.    3. Add 2 cups of the boiling water, stir, and lower heat and cook at a  simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Add the rice and the additional  1/2 cup water, and stir. Cook covered, at a low simmer, until the liquid is  absorbed and the rice is almost tender (15-20 minutes).    4. Add the milk, bring the mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring often to  prevent sticking but being careful to keep the grains whole, until it is  thickened and the rice is cooked (about 15 minutes).    5. Add the sugar, cardamom, and raisins, and continue cooking for 3 more  minutes. Stir in the remaining ghee 2 tablespoons at a time, and most of  the cashew nuts (save some for garnish). Let the pudding rest, covered, for  15 minutes before you serve it Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled,  either as a dessert or as a snack all by itself.    *For a more elaborate presentation pour the freshly made pudding into a  lightly oiled 8-cup mold and chill. Unmold on an attractive plate, slice,  and serve with softly whipped unsweetened heavy cream.
