Melt half the butter in heavy large deep skillet over medium heat. Add  onions and bell pepper and saute until light golden, about 10 minutes. Add  mushrooms and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Mix in flour  and paprika and stir 2 minutes.  Mix in stock and tomato paste. Bring to  boil, stirring constantly. Boil until sauce thickens and paprika flavor  mellows, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Mix in sour cream. Remove  from heat and add dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be  prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to simmer before adding  beef.)    Melt half of remaining butter in another heavy large skillet over  medium-high heat.  Working in batches, add beef, season with salt and  pepper and cook until just brown on each side. Transfer to plate. Add more  butter as needed.  When all beef is brown, add to sauce along with any  drippings on plate.  Add dry white wine to skillet and bring to boil,  scraping up any browned bits. Boil until syrupy, about 3 minutes. Add to  beef.  Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes before serving, if desired.    Source: Bon App?tit magazine - October 1992
