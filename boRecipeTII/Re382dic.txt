Place chicken in a bowl or casserole. Cover with lemon juice and marinate  in refrigerator for several hours or overnight, turning chicken  periodically. Preheat oven to 450F Put margarine and olive oil in a shallow  baking pan and place in over until margarine melts (about 5 minutes).  Meanwhile, combine flour, salt, paprika, and pepper in plastic bag. Remove  chicken breasts from marinade and coat each with flour by shaking it in the  plastic bag. Remove baking pan from oven and lower heat to 350F. Place  chicken in the baking pan in a single layer. Either peel the yellow zest  from two lemons and chop it fine with the brown sugar in your food  processor, or grate the zest and mix it with the brown sugar. Sprinkle the  lemon zest-sugar mixture evenly over chicken. Put 1 lemon slice on each  chicken breast and bake chicken for 35 minutes or until it is cooked  through.    Notes: A delicate blending of tart and sweet, Lemon Chicken cant help but  become one of your most popular family or company dishes.
