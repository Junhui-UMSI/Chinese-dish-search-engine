Applesauce Bran Muffins
All purpose flour, Sugar, Salt, Butter, Applesauce, WHOLE BRAN CEREAL, Baking Powder, LARGE EGG, milk, 
Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and bran cereal.       In another bowl beat egg well and then add milk, applesauce, and       melted butter.  Mix the egg mixture and flour mixture just until       they are well blended. Divide the batter among 12 greased muffin       tin cups.  Each cup should be about 2/3 full. Bake at 400 degrees       F for about 20 minutes. You can test to see if the muffins are       done by sticking a toothpick into the center of them. If the       toothpick comes out clean, the muffins are done. Otherwise, let       them bake for another 5 minutes and try again.
