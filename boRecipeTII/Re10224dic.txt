Quick and Easy Meat Pies
Celery, Lemon Rind, Cream cheese, Salt and pepper, Garlic, Ground chuck, Frozen spinach, Onions, Pecans, Lemon juice, flaky biscuits, 
Saute chuck, onions, celery, pecans and garlic in skillet over medium heat  until beef is lightly brown. Drain well. Stir in spinach, lemon juice, and  rind and cream cheese. Salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to cool for a  few minutes. To make pies, flatten each biscuit with palm of hand; place a  heaping tablespoon of filling in center of each biscuit, fold over and seal  edges with a fork. Place on greased baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees  for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve immediately. These can be  made ahead, refrigerated, and taken on a picnic - they are as good as when  hot.
