Pour batter into greased canning jars,  filling half-full. Place jars on cookie sheet. Bake upright in preheated  325 degree oven for about 45 minutes. (Cake will rise and pull away from  sides of jar.) When done, remove one jar at a time from oven. While still  warm, place wax paper circle on the top end of the cake. Wipe sealing edge  of jar. Place lid on jar and close tightly with ring. Turn jar upside down.  (Cake will loosen at this time.) Repeat with other jars. Leave jars upside  down until sealed. (Jar is sealed if lid remains flat when pressed in  center.) To serve: Open jar, slide a knife around inside of the jar to  loosen the cake, and remove the cake from the jar. Warm cake in the oven if  desired. Slice and serve with whipped cream. This dessert treat is baked  and presented in a wide-mouth canning jar. Because the jar is sealed, the  cake keeps indefinitely. It can be made well ahead of the holidays.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #345    From: "Carol D. Westover" <tehachap@adnc.com>    Date: Mon, 16 Dec 1996 19:33:23 -0800
