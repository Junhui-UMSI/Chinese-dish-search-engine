Originally, Peking duck was served in three courses, to wit:    1. the familiar pancake, scallion, and sauce bit (cucumber slivers  also sometimes), with which the skin was served without the meat;    2. the meat, combined with stir-fried vegetables in a soy-based sauce,  served alone or with rice;    3. a soup made with the bones of the duck just eaten.    Now, in our streamlined 20th century, the courses are combined into  one, the meat wrapped up with the skin and the scallion in the  pancake, the vegetable course is omitted, and the soup is presumably  drunk by the staff.    Cut cabbage across into 1 - 1.5" chunks (these will separate on  cooking). Soak bean thread in water until soft, then cut into 6"  lengths (Warning - if you omit this cutting, you may find a guest  choking on the stuff, which I did once).    Simmer in water to cover for 45 min: bones from 1 Peking duck:  carcass, neck, gizzard (which had been roasted with the duck), wings,  leg and thigh bones. Season with 1 scallion and 1 slice ginger.    Heat oil in a soup kettle. Add ginger, salt, and cabbage. Stir-fry 1  min. Add all remaining ingredients except bean thread, gizzard, and  MSG (if used). Cover and cook until cabbage is tender, 3 min or so.  Bring soup to a boil, add bean thread, gizzard, and MSG. Turn heat  off. Serve immediately.
