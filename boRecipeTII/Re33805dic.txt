Sweet and Sour Mustard Sauce #2
Eggs, Dry mustard powder, Vinegar, Sugar, 
COMBINE THE VINEGAR AND DRY MUSTARD AND LET STAND OVER NIGHT. THE NEXT DAY  BEAT THE EGGS AND SUGAR TOGETHER. ADD TO THE MUSTARD MIXTURE, IN A SMALL  PAN, AND COOK OVER MEDIUM HEAT UNTIL THICK. STORE IN THE REFRIGERATOR, IN A  TIGHT LIDDED JAR. THIS WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS.    Date: Sun, 23 Jun 1996 13:01:02 -0400    From: "Vernon E.
