This recipe is not exactly the way my wife makes it, but close.   She always fiddles with recipes to adjust to our liking.    If I ask her to tell me what she changed she would say something like "A little here and a little there.  Dont remember exactly."      Creole Tomato Sauce:   Boil tomatoes 2 to 3 minutes, remove skins, cut in half, remove seeds and  dice. Heat olive oil in medium saucepan, add shallots and cook for 2 minutes, add garlic, thyme, oregano, basil and white pepper. Sweat shallots  until clear. Add diced tomatoes, bring to a boil, add red wine and sugar,  reduce heat, simmer for 1 hour or until cooked. Salt and pepper to taste.  Puree in blender.      JAMBALAYA:    In medium saucepan melt butter, add 1/2 the onions(4 oz)and sweat until  clear. Add rice, 1 bay leaf and 1 ounce of chicken stock, bring to boll  then place in 450 degree oven, 5 to 7 minutes.   Remove from oven and hold.  (Rice should be about 1/2 cooked.)    In heavy gauge pot render fat out of sausage.   Remove sausage and drain. In  the remaining fat in pot, saute chicken, remove, drain and hold. In  remaining fat, saute onions, celery, green peppers garlic and seasonings  (thyme, basil, oregano, white pepper, cayenne pepper and remaining bay  leaves).   Dust with flour. Cook for 5 minutes.
