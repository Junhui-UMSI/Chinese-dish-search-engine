While this and the other recipes donated by Laura Steels can be traced back  to 1859, this dish was by no eans typical of everyday cooking in San  Bernardino at that date. The complexity of the seasoning, the inclusion of  wine, and the use of a garnish all suggest the more complex cuisine of the  Eastern urban elite.  Wash the meat well; season it highly; bind it up tight and lay it in a pot  that will just hold it; fry the vegetables until they are tender, and add  them to the meat; cover the meat with the beef broth; simmer it gently for  several hours, till quite tender; clear as much fat as possible from the  gravy; add the wine, vinegar, and catsup; simmer    half an hour longer. The beer may be added with the wine. Add the herbs  with the wine mixture; let there be a good handful all together. Garnish  with carrots, turnips, mushrooms, or pickles. A spoonful or two of prepared  mustard is a great improvement to the gravy.    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 09, 1998
