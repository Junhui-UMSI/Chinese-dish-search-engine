Applesauce Oatmeal Drops
Natural unsweetened, Rolled oats, Sugar, Seedless raisins, Sifted all purpose flour, Brown sugar, Baking soda, Applesauce, Baking Powder, Salt, 
Mix sugars and add applesauce.  Sift together dry ingrediants and stir in.  Add oats and raisins.  Drop by spoonfuls onto lightly greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees about 10 minutes.    Note:  I left out the raisins because I dont care for them. Also, I added  1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  The next time I make these I may cut back on the  sugar because they are rather sweet.  These cookies were nice and fluffy  (for a fat-less cookie) and remind me of muffins.  These are so quick and  easy to make, I just love them!  I hope everyone enjoys them.
