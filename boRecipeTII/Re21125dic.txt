Two-Corn Bread
Yellow corn flour;, Buttermilk, Baking soda, Masa harina, Bacon; thick-sliced, cut, Egg, Salt, 
This is best eaten warm from the oven, but its also delicious toasted.    Preheat oven to 450F. Put the bacon in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet and  cook in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the fat is rendered.    Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the cornmeal, masa harina, baking soda  and salt. Stir in the buttermilk and egg just until blended; do not  overmix.    Swirl the bacon to coat the pan with the drippings, then remove the bacon  from the pan and discard. Stir any excess drippings into the batter, then  pour the batter into the hot pan and spread evenly with a spoon. Bake for  about 10 minutes, or until the bread is set and a knife inserted into the  center comes out clean. Serve hot.
