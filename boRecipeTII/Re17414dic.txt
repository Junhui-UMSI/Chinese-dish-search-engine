At least 1 1/2 hours before serving, peel and section the oranges. With a  serrated knife or citrus knife, remove the membrane lining from each orange  segment. Place oranges in a bowl and squeeze all excess juice from the  remaining lining over the oranges. Discard any membrane and pick out seeds,  if necessary. Drizzle honey and sprinkle cinnamon over oranges, cover and  let stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Clean greens and pat  dry. Break into bite size pieces and toss well with onions, radishes and  nuts in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over salad and toss to distribute.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Just before serving,  add the oranges and all their liquid. Mix well.
