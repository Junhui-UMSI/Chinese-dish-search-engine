"Augment your Far East platter with chic Vietnamese-style spring rolls  filled with rice vermicelli and vegetables. "The key to making firm spring  rolls is to keep the rice papers damp and pliable."   Cook vermicelli,  uncovered, in boiling water 2 minutes or just until limp. Rinse in cold  water; drain well; chop into very short pieces. Combine vermicelli,  lettuce, carrot and peanuts.   Combine cilantro, mint, fish sauce, oils and  red pepper; add to noodle mixture. Toss ingredients thoroughly.   Pour warm  water into a large shallow dish. Dip 1 or 2 rice papers at a time into  water; gently shake off excess. Place between clean, damp 100% cotton  kitchen towels; let stand 10 minutes.   Spoon 3 tablespoon of noodle mixture  onto one rice paper just below center of paper. Tightly roll filled rice  paper up from bottom, tucking in opposite sides as you roll. Repeat with  remaining papers and noodle mixture, covering rolls as you make them to  prevent drying.   Combine hoisin sauce, plum sauce and 1/4 cup water. Spoon  over spring rolls to serve. Makes 16 rolls.
