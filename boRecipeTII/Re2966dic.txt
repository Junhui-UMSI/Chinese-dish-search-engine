Peanut Butter Pralines
milk, Peanut butter, Sugar, 
In medium saucepan, mix sugar and milk. There should be just enough milk to  dissolve the sugar. If it is too liquidy, add more sugar. Boil on high  until you get a soft ball when dropped into a cup of cold water. Add peanut  butter. When it starts to fudge (pulls away from saucepan), drop by spoon  onto lightly buttered wax paper on cookie sheet or flat surface. Let set  and cool.
