Unbaked Chocolate Cookies
milk, Oatmeal, Salt, Vanilla, Sugar, Cocoa, Coconut, Margarine, 
Mix the sugar, cocoa, margarine, and milk in a saucepan. Bring to boil and  boil for about 3 minutes, or until the sugar granules dissolve. Pour into a  bowl that already contains the rest of the ingredients, and mix thoroughly.  Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper and let cool. They seem to do better if  kept in the refrigerator or freezer.    Origin:  My recipe file Shared by: Sharon Stevens.
