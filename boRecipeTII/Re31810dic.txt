Squeeze the garlic clove(s) into the sauce  using a garlic press. Stir thoroughly to blend. Let stand for 1 hour. Add  the rice to the boiling water. Lower the heat to a very low, gentle simmer.  Cover. Simmer until the water is all absorbed (20-30 minutes). Heat the  wok.  Add the oil. Stir fry the onion and green pepper. Add the scallops.  Stir fry until heated through. Add the pea pods and mushrooms. Stir fry  until the pea pods are tender crisp (the rice should be ready at this  time).  Serve hot over the cooked rice with soy sauce alongside. ~~~ Ed  Hunter    EAT-L DIGEST 18 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
