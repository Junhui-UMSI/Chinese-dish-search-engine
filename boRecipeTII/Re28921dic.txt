Fry garlic in oil until golden brown over medium heat.   Increase heat to medium high and add chicken, pork and shrimps. Cook until  meats are almost done, add eggs     and scramble. Cook half way through, add rice and pineapple and mix  quickly. Sprinkle sugar, white peppers, fish sauce, green onions and mix  well, cook about 2 minutes longer,stirring constantly, then remove from  heat. Serve hot with sliced pickles and chili peppers with chopped cilantro  sprinkled on top. Makes 12 servings.     NOTE: cook rice with a little less water than you normally would because  rice will absorb juice from the meats, therefore, it wont be soggy.  Formatted by Elaine Radis BGMB90B; October, 1993
