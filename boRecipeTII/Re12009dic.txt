recipes I just downloaded from Cooking Lights website (sorry, my MC is  down right now).    Youll have about 3/4 cup of the chickpea spread left over. Serve it with  baked tortilla chips for a high-carbohydrate snack.    1. Combine first 6 ingredients in a food processor; process until smooth.  Cover and chill. Combine tomato, cucumber, onion, and dressing in a bowl;  cover and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour. Drain tomato mixture; discard  marinade. Line each pita half with a lettuce leaf; spread each with 3  tablespoons chickpea mixture. Spoon about 2/3 cup marinated vegetables into  each pita half. Yield: 4 servings.
