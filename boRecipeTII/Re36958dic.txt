Thaw a short time before cutting, store in freezer.    Ive also made this with lemon yoghurt, using two containers of yoghurt and  it made a nice lemon pie. And I have used fresh strawberries, cut up and  sweetened, in place of the frozen ones.    EAT-L Digest 10 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
