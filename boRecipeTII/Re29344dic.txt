Preheat oven to 400 F.     Grease a shallow baking dish or pan large enough to hold the 6 tomatoes.     Wash tomatoes and cut off stem end (not too close). Using a teaspoon,  scoop out seeds and pulp and discard. Turn tomatoes upside down on paper  towels to drain and place in baking dish.     Wash leeks very thoroughly and pat dry.  Cut away the tough green tips.  Lay the leek pieces flat on a cutting board and slice crosswise very fine.     Melt the 4 tablespoons butter in a saute pan, add leeks and cook until  soft (do not overcook). Season with salt, pepper, and Tabasco.     Spoon 1/6 of the cooked leeks into each tomato, then a tablespoon of  cheese and a tablespoon of breadcrumbs over the cheese.  Place a  half-teaspoon of butter on top of each tomato.  Lower oven temperature to  350 F and bake for 12 minutes.     Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.    _Classic American Cooking_  Pearl Byrd Foster, 1983 Simon & Schuster ISBN  0-671-44303-8   Typos by Jeff Pruett  Posted to recipelu-digest by GramWag <GramWag@aol.com> on Mar 18, 1998
