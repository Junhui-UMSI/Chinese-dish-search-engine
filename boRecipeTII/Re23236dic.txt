Drain tuna, and if you are finicky, bone it; keep the brine!  Combine tuna,  egg, parsley, pepper and nearly all of the matzoh meal, mix well.  Form  into 1 inch balls and roll in the remaining matzoh meal. Boil at least 2  qts water, add brine and introduce balls with plenty of "elbow room", so  they wont jostle each other (you wont be able to cook them all at one  go).  Dont turn balls over: theyll turn of their own account when half  done.  Cooking time: About 6 mins.    (note: Some prefer frying the balls slightly, before boiling)    DAVE <DAVIDG@CLAM.RUTGERS.EDU>    RECIPEINTERNET LIST SERVER    RECIPE ARCHIVE - 26 MARCH 1996    From the RECIPEinternet: Recipes from Around the World recipe list.
