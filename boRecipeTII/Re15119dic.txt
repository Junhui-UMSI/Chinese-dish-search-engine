Wheat Amber
Kwoffit Bitter kit (hopped, Extract), Kwoffit yeast, Light dry malt extract, Fuggles leaf hops, Crystal malt, Wheat malt, 
Steep the crystal and wheat malts. Boil the resulting mixture with   the  Kwoffit kit and the light extract. Add a small amount (up to 1/2  ounce) of  the Fuggles hops in the last minute of the boil. The result is  extravagantly tasty---very rich and full-bodied,  strongly hopped but not  tart. I am quickly becoming a believer in the value of  a little wheat malt  for adding flavorful body. It seems to work very  well with crystal malt.  Body, crispness, sweetness, hoppiness...heaven.
