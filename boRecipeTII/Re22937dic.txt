Arizona Desert Chili
Green bell peppers, Ground cumin, Chili powder, Beef, Vegetable oil, Tomatoes, Ground oregano, Garlic, Onions, Jalapeno peppers, Beer, 
* Have beef chopped, not ground.    1. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add garlic, onions and green pepper.  saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes.    2. Add beef and lightly brown on all surfaces. Drain off some of the fat if  a lot has accumulated. Lean beef trimmed of all fat should not have an  excess amount, however.    3. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour or slightly longer. Put  a cover on skillet during cooking time, and slightly tilt it so steam can  escape. Check often and stir to prevent sticking. Skim off fat as it rises.  Best if allowed to sit, tightly covered, for an hour after cooking is  complete.    Serving Ideas : Serve with cornbread or cheese biscuits.    NOTES : This chili can be mild or very hot depending upon the use of  jalape?o peppers. Some chili lovers say you should never put beans in chili  so this recipe omits them. This recipe is from a truck driver named Sparky  that we met in Arizona, a firm believer in no-bean chili.
