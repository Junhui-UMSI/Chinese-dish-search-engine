Raw Apple Cookies
Vanilla, Peeled, diced apples**, All purpose flour +/- 1 cup, Dark brown sugar, Butter or margarine*, Baking soda, Cinnamon, Granulated sugar, Eggs (large), Ground cloves, Raisins or chopped walnuts, Ground ginger, 
NOTE: This recipe is for a DOUBLE BATCH. These cookies are so good one  batch is never enough so I always make a double batch.    * Be sure to use regular margarine and not a spread. ** Any kind of apples  can be used.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray cookie sheets with PAM or Bakers Secret  or lightly grease. Cream butter or margarine and sugars. Add eggs, beating  well after each addition. Add vanilla. Stir in baking soda, cinnamon,  ground ginger and cloves. Stir in apples, nuts and raisins (if desired ).  Add the flour and mix well.    I start with 6 cups of flour and according to the humidity level that day,  I add up to an additional cup of flour. Drop by teaspoonful onto lightly  greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until  lightly browned.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #257 by SVQF34B@prodigy.com ( L M SMITH) on  Sep 27, 1997
