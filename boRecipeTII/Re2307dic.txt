Source: Miriam of Givat Sharett contributed to the Connections English  monthly Beit Shemesh magazine    Melt margarine in 1&1/2 quart casserole. Add onions and cook until wilted.  Add broth to measuring cup and add liquid from mushrooms until total liquid  measures 2 cups, and add to onions. Add mushrooms, barley and salt(?). Bake  uncovered at 350 fahrenheit, stirring several times, for 1 hour. Cover very  tightly and bake 1/2 hour more. Notes: I always double this recipe. I am  generous with the onions, mushrooms and chicken powder flavoring and it  goes like wildfire.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Charles Rosenstein <cr18@gezernet.co.il> on  Oct 27, 1998,
