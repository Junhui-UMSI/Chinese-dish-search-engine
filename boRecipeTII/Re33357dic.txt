Basic Vegetable Platter
Fresh coriander (Chinese, Cucumber *, Soft lettuce leaves;, Fresh mint leaves, 
* peeled in lengthwise strips and with green strips in between, then  cut in half lengthwise and into thin horizontal slices, forming  semi-circles.    A salad or vegetable platter is a very important part of a Vietnamese  meal; indeed, it is served at practically every one.  The vegetables,  which are eaten along with many dishe, are arranged on a platter, and  diner helps himself to whatever he desires.  In Vietnam we used many  more vegetables and herbs than we can find in the West.  But, in  spite of that, the following platter makes a satisfactory  accompaniment to the dishes we have prepared for this book.  All  vegetables and herbs are those served in Vietnam, except that the  variety is smaller.    Arrange a mound of lettuce in the center of a platter.  Around the  lettuce, and touching it, arrange separate mounds of mint and  coriander.    Arrange the cucumbers in overlapping slices around the complete outer  rim of the platter.    This is the basic arrangement of the vegetable platter.  On those  occasions when a recipe calls for another vegetable, it can be added  to this platter.    Makes 8 servings.
