Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Cream the margarine (  or butter) and sugar together until light, white and fluffy. Beat in the  egg and almond essence. Stir in the sifted dry ingredients to make a stiff  dough. Form the mixture into balls about 1 - 1.5 inch diameter and place  these on a greased baking tray. Place half an almond (split lengthways) on  each ball and press to flatten slightly. Brush with beaten egg. Bake in a  moderate oven (350 deg F / 180 deg C) for 20 minutes or until golden. Cool  on a wire rack. This quantity makes about 45 biscuits.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /MISC    PART OF A COMPLETE DINNER MENU    From rec.food.cooking archives.
