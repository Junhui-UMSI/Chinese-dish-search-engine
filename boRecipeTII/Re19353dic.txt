In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.  Stir in the millet, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer until the water is  absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes. (The millet must be freshly cooked and still  warm to form the patties).     Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add  the celery and onion and cook, until softened, about 6 minutes. Transfer to  a large bowl.     In a food preocessor fitted with the metal blade, combine the bread,  walnuts, parsley, basil, thyme and tamari and process until coarsely  chopped. Add to the onion/celery mixture.     Add the cooked millet to the onion mixture, along with the grated carrot,  and stir to mix.     Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil a baking sheet.     Shape the warm millet mixture into 2-inch patties (about 1/2 cup) to serve  as a main dish or 1-inch patties (about 1/8) cup for an appetizer. Roll  each patty in the Herbed Bread Crumbs, patting to make the crumbs adhere,  and put on the baking sheet. Bake until lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.     Arrange the patties on a serving platter and garnish each one with a  walnut half or a sprig of parsley.     May All Be Fed by John Robbins/MM by DEEANNE
