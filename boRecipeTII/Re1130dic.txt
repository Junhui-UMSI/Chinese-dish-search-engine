1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour,  salt and baking soda. Stir in the oats. In a medium bowl, using an electric  mixer, cream the butter with the granulated and brown sugars until light  and fluffy. Add the egg and beat until thoroughly incorporated. Scrape down  the sides with a rubber spatula and beat for another       30    seconds. Using the spatula, fold in the flour/oatmeal mixture  until completely incorporated. Mix in the pecans and cranberries.    2. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Form the mixture into balls  about 1-1/4 inches in diameter. Place the balls about 3 inches apart on the  cookie sheets.    3. Bake the cookies for 10 - 12 minutes, or until golden brown and lacy.  Let cool completely on the cookie sheets. Using a metal spatula, transfer  the cookies to a plate. The cookies will keep for up to 1 week in an  airtight container, or one month in the freezer. Makes about 4 dozen  cookies.
