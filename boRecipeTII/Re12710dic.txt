Yorkshire Pudding
Salt and pepper, garlic, Flour, Eggs, beef drippings, milk, 
Preheat oven to 450F. Beat the eggs until very light and fluffy, then  gradually beat in the flour and milk. Season with a pinch of salt, freshly  ground black pepper, and 2 Tbsp of beef drippings. Rub the pan (either a  flat baking dish, or muffin tins) with the cut side of the garlic. Heat the  pan in the oven, then add the remaining 1/4 cup drippings and pour in the  batter. (If using muffin tins: heat tins in oven, then put a spoonful of  drippings in each slot and full each about 1/3 full with batter.) Bake at  450F for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 350F and bake 10-15 minutes more,  or until puddings is puffy and golden brown. Do not open the oven during  the first 20 minutes of baking or the pudding will fall. If you make one  large pudding, cut in squares to serve.
