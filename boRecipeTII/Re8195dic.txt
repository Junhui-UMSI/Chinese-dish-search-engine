Potato Garbanzo Gnocchis
Boiling water, Smoked nutritional yeast, Garlic powder, Garbanzo Flour, Rice Flour, Sea salt, (optional), Non-alum baking powder, (optional), AM Potato Flakes, Cayenne or red pepper, 
Combine water and potato flakes quickly.  They will set up firmly and be  somewhat dry.  Stir in the remaining ingredients.  Drop by the teaspoonful  onto hot oil and deep fry until golden brown.  Omitting the baking powder  will result in denser gnocchis.    Source: Arrowhead Mills "Recipes for Special Dietary Needs" tri-fold  Reprinted by permission of Arrowhead Mills, Inc.
