Advent Cookies
Cocoa powder, Cinnamon, Plain flour (approximately), Butter or margarine, -teacup molasses or black, Vanilla, Light brown sugar, 
Preheat the oven to 400F.  Mix all of the ingredients together, except for  the flour.  Add the flour slowly to the rest of the mixture until it  reaches the right consistency to roll out.  The dough should be quite soft.  (You may find it easier to knead it with your hands.) Roll out on a floured  surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch and cut into decorative shapes  with small cookie cutters, a sharp knife or the rim of a glass. Place on a  greased baking sheet and bake in the oven for about 8 minutes. Remove from  the oven while they are still soft and cool on a rack, then pack into  crocks or jars.    The authors note that the Pennsylvania Dutch settlers made these at  Thanksgiving and stored them in a stoneware crock until Christmas. The  cookies can be made at any time, but allowed to age for 4-6 weeks. They can  be used as a substitute for graham crackers for a pie crust.    from Edible Gifts by Claire Clifton and Martina Nicolls typed by Tiffany  Hall-Graham From: Tiffany Hall-Graham Date: 05 Mar 95    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #258      Date: Fri, 20 Sep 1996 18:29:37 -0500      From: netdir@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)
