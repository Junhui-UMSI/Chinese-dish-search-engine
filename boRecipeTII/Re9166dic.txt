In  medium mixing bowl combine cornmeal, 1 1/2 c. cold water and salt. Slowly  add cornmeal mixture (STIRRING CONSTANTLY TO AVOID LUMPS). Cook and stir  till mixture returns to boiling. Reduce heat to very low. Cover and simmer  for 15 min, stirring occasionally. Stir 3/4 c. of shredded cheese into hot  polenta. Turn hot mixture into ungreased 13x9 inch pan. Cool slightly.  Cover and chill for several hours or till firm. Meanwhile, place pepper  halves, cut side down, on foil-lined baking dish. Bake at 425 degrees for  20-25 min. or till skin is brown. Immediately place in a brown paper lunch  bag; seal. Let cool in bag so steam will loosen the skin. When peppers are  cool enough to handle, peel off skins, using sharp knife. In blender  container combine peppers, sugar, vinegar and salt. Cover and blend till  smooth.  Transfer to small saucepan to heat through the sauce. Cut chilled  polenta crosswise each way to make triangles and arrange on lightly greased  baking sheet.  Brush polenta pieces with olive oil. Broil 4-5 inches from  heat source for 4 minutes. Turn polenta over and brush with more olive oil.  Broil 4 minutes more or till golden brown. Sprinkle with remaining  provolone cheese.  Then let polenta sit for few minutes till cheese melts.  To serve, line plates with arugula. Place polenta pieces on top of arugula  and top with warm pepper sauce.    EAT-L Digest 12 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
