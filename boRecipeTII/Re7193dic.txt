Notes: Recipe originated in an article by Michael McLaughlin for Bon  Appetit 98-Feb. If you like mustard, then this is the vehicle for it. We  called this a spice loaf: it had more ham with a smokier flavor. A slice of  ham needs the additional smoke of a chipotle pepper (or equivalent). *One  small egg may be substitute. The loaf could serve 6 adults with three  accompaniments. Coleslaw is the traditional choice. Skip the potatoes and  peas: serve with a lentil stew with shredded cabbage. -pat    Recipe by: Michael McLaughlin (1998-Feb) Bon Appetit*    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by KitPATh <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on Feb 13,  1998
