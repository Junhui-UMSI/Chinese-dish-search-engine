Cut watermelon into pieces. Trim off rind; discard.  Discard seeds.  In  batches, puree watermelon flesh in a blender or food processor or by hand  [1].  Pour into a bowl and set aside in the refrigerator to chill.  [2]    Rinse berries, drain, then puree in a blender or processor. Rub puree  through a strainer to collect and discard seeds.  [2]    Optional:  Cut prosciutto into very thin shreds. Place shreds in a 10-inch  nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until prosciutto is  browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels until cool.    ASSEMBLY -  Pour melon puree equally into 6 or 4 bowls. With a small spoon,  dollop raspberry puree in a circle, spacing drops well apart and adding  equally small amount to each portion.  With the tip of a skewer or small  knife, pull through the raspberry dots, drawing them out into swirls  through yellow puree. Sprinkle with prosciutto and mint [3] or one-or-more  of the other meatless garnishes. (Can serve 8.)    [1] The round, seedless watermelon is first available late-April.  These  and other nearly 100%-water melons liquify when processed. Test first:  crush by hand. If the strands start to disintegrate, mash by hand. The soup  needs some body. [2] May be chilled up to 1 day in advance. [3] Use a fresh  herb to splash the soup with some green. (Ive used cilantro and red  seedless grapes.)
