1. Preheat broiler.    2. Heat oil in medium-size skillet.Lightly fry the tortilas one at a time  in the hot oil until crisp. Fry only a few seconds; the tortillas will burn  if kept in the oil too long.    3. Top each tortilla with cheese & chillies. Broil about 1 minute, or until  hot and the cheese is bubbling. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Serve  immediately with Spanish Sauce. Directions for Spanish Sauce: Place the  onion, tomatoes, chillies, bell pepper, garlic, and salt and pepper in a  saucepan. Add just enough chicken broth to cover. Place a lid on the  saucepan and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, Remove from heat and set aside. Note:  Sauce may be stored and used with other dishes.
