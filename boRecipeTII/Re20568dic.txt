It came from Eating Well.  I found this a little too  sweet, so now I skip or halve the glaze.  Ive also tried this using  artificial sweetener and the texture is fine.    Use a 6-cake minibundt pan or a regular bundt pan.  For minibundt pan, oven  400 degrees cook 10 to 12 minutes.  For regular bundt pan, oven 375 and  cook 25 to 30 minutes. Preheat oven and prepare pan by coating it with  nonstick spray and a light dusting of granulated sugar.    Mix flour, baking powder, soda, salt, cinnamon.  Set aside.  In another  bowl, mix egg, brown sugar, apple butter, syrup, cider, yogurt, and oil.  Add dry ingredients and stir until just moistened. Use about two generous  tablespoons per minibundt cup - makes twelve.  Dip shaped side of  "doughnuts" in glaze to coat.
