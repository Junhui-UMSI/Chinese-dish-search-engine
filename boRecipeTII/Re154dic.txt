Head of cabbage, Salt, Water, 
Shred cabbage in a food processor.   Put into large bowl and salt to taste.    Cabbage should start to "sweat" then add enough water to cover cabbage.   Put a plate on top of cabbage to keep submerged. Should make in a few weeks.  You may have to add salt and water throughout the process. Remember every time you add water you must add salt. I always do this to taste. It is really very easy to make.
