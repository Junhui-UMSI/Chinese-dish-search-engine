Ann Arbor Blue (For All University of Michigan Fans)
Sugar, Orange juice, Grape juice, Blueberries, 
Liquefy in blender:    Phillip Graebing wrote that he had lost his blueberry recipes. I have a  cookbook called "The Blueberry Connection" - 209 pages of nothing but  blueberry recipes. Being its that time of the year, hopefully some of the  following will refresh Phillips files    Serve about 1/3 blueberry blend with 1/3 white wine and 1/3 crushed ice.  Top with sprig of mint.    "It is said that the Indians used the blueberry as an anti-spasmodic to  ease the pain of childbirth. This remedy was later adopted by many of the  early settlers."
