Chop walnuts extremely finely.  In a microwave or double-boiler, melt  chocolate chips, condensed milk, and 1 tbsp butter, mixing occasionally,  until well mixed to a chocolate frosting consistency. Add nuts, mix, and  cool.    In a separate bowl, cream the rest of the butter with the brown sugar, then  add the vanilla extract, flour, and salt.  The dough should be rather  crumbly. If necessary, add the milk or water to make it hold better. Divide  the dough into three equal parts. Roll out onto waxed paper or plastic  wrap, making a rectangle two to three times as long as it is wide. You may  chill the dough if it makes it easier to work with.    Spread a third of the chocolate mixture onto each dough section, and roll  into a jellyroll shape.  Bake at 350F for approximately 30 minutes, until  light brown.  Cool.    Slice each log into slices between 1/2" and 1" in thickness.  If you want  to keep them longer, dont slice the log until ready to serve. The pieces  never last long, though, so I wouldnt worry!
