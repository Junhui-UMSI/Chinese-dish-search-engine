This "taco" casserole recipe is always a hit! I dont use exact  measurements, but Ill try to give the general idea.    Fry hamburger. Add taco mix and enough water to be a sauce consistency.  Heat up chili. Grate cheese (sharp cheddar is besT.    Cover bottom of 9 1/2 x 13 baking dish with Fritos (probably some left  over) Put meat mixture on top. Sprinkle onions on top. Pour chili on top of  this. (It should cover well..may need more) Put cheese on top. Bake at 350  until hot (bubbly)....probably 20"    Serve with tomatoes/lettuce available. Also salsa.    This is the first time Ive tried to post a recipe....hope it works. :)    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #016, by Alan Johnson <slam@netcom.com> on  Tue, 14 Jan 1997.
