Vegetable Stuffed Round Steak
Pepper, spaghetti sauce, olive oil, Garlic salt, Cheddar cheese, Carrot, Zucchini, Round steak, 
Pound round steak until very thin. Rub olive oil into steak. Sprinkle  evenly with garlic salt and pepper. Layer carrots, zucchini, and cheese  down the center of the steak lengthwise.    Roll up steak from the long side. Tie together with four pieces of string.  Use a meat rack if you have one that will fit. Place meat in crockpot and  cover with spaghetti sauce. Cover and cook on Low 7-9 hours (High 3-4  hours).    NOTES : The only trouble with this recipe is that one tends to overeat.
