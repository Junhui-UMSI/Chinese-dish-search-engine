(From The Best Bread machine Cookbook Ever: Ethnic Breads, M. Rosenberg,  HarperCollins Books, 1994)    1. Stir the vinegar into the milk. Let stand about 30 min, until the  mixture thickens.    2. Add ingredients (except raisins) but including the vinegar and milk, in  the order suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the bread  cycle according to the manufacturers directions.    3. At the beeper (or at the end of the first kneading in the Panasonic,  Sanyo, and National, or after 40 min from "start" for Toastmaster) add the  raisins.    === Notes === *TM indicates amounts I used for the Toastmaster, which  typically takes less liquids than other machines.    This bread rises more slowly than other breads in the machine so I use the  "sweet bread cycle." Posted to Digest bread-bakers.v097.n046 by  sue@interport.net (Curly Sue) on Jul 6, 1997
