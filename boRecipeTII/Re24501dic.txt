These wonderful little make-ahead hors doeuvres are a treat to assemble in  the spring when asparagus hits the market. You can store them in your  freezer for a time later in the year when the taste would really hit the  spot.    Blanch asparagus spears until barely tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain  immediately and plunge into cold water to stop the cooking process. Remove  crusts from bread and flatten slices with a rolling pin. In a medium bowl,  combine cheeses and egg, blending with an electric beater. Spread mixture  evenly over bread slices. Trim asparagus spears to same length as bread  slices, and then place one spear on each slice and roll up, jelly roll  fashion. Dip each roll in melted butter to coat all sides, and place on a  cookie sheet.  Freeze rolls until hard, then re-package in freezer-storage  containers. When ready to bake, cut frozen rolls into thirds and bake  (while still frozen) in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes or until lightly  browned.  Serve immediately. Yields 75 pieces.
