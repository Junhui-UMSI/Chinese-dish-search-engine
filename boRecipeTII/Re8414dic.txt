This is a potato-dumpling soup, and it sounds like a double batch of  starch. It is just that. The rivels, which means "lumps," give the soup a  thick richness that is very filling. This is a very healing dish on a cold  winter day.      Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a 4-quart stockpot. Add the diced  potatoes and cook until tender. Add the butter, milk and celery leaves.  Bring to a simmer and add salt and pepper to taste. I love lots of pepper  in this dish.      In a small bowl stir the beaten egg into the flour. Stir with a fork  until you have a grainy mixture. Sprinkle small amounts at a time into the  soup, stirring all the while with a wooden fork. Cook the rivels in the  soup for 15 minutes. Be carefulwith these rivels, as they will lump up.      Serve with the chopped egg and parsley garnish.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
