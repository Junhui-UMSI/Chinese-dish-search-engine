Rainbow Spuds
All-purpose or waxy, Salt, milk, Butter, 
Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover them;  add the salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low,  cover and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until very tender; drain well.  Return the potatoes to the saucepan over low heat. Mash with a potato  masher or fork. Add the milk and butter and continue mashing until smooth  and well-blended.    Note: Heres how we get our rainbow-colored potatoes:    For Hot Pink Potatoes: Add 1 can (8 1/4 ounces) beets, drained, to the  cooked potatoes and mash. For a smoother texture, puree the beets in a food  processor before adding. For Green Potatoes: Add 2 whole, peeled garlic  cloves to the potatoes before cooking. Thaw a 10-ounce package of frozen  chopped spinach and squeeze dry. Add to the cooked potatoes and mash.  Season with nutmeg. For Carrot or Parsnip Mashed Potatoes: Substitute 1  pound peeled carrots or parsnips, cut into 1/2-inch slices, for 1 pound of  the potatoes. Cook parsnips along with the potatoes and mash as above until  well combined.    Recipe by: MR FOOD    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Meg Antczak <meginny@frontiernet.net> on Feb  27, 1998
