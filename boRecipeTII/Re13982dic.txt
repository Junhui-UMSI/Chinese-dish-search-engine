Winter Chatmans Spice Baked Chicken
Chicken, 
Buy 1 whole nice chicken at the market Wash well, inside and out Take out  liver, gizard, heart and put aside Assemble the spices below 2 or 5  tablespoons of McCormick or Shilling seasoning. Dont use Lowerys, too  salty Seasoned pepper 4 teaspoons garlic salt 4 teaspoons Italian seasoning  Mix all of the spices and put all over the chicken, inside and out. Smother  it! Wrap the chicken in foil and put in the freezer overnight. Not the  fridge, the freezer.  When your ready to cook it, thaw and bake in a 450  degree oven until done. I tried it and it was delicious. (PS.) She also  said that you could also barbeque this!
