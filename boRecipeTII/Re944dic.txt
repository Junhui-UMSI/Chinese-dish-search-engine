Hush Puppies
Self rising white cornmeal, All purpose flour, Sugar, Baking Powder, Onion powder or 1 med. onion, Buttermilk, Bacon dripping; (optional), 
Combine all dry ingredients. Add buttermilk and bacon drippings and stir  mixture until well blended. Pour about 4 inches of cooking oil into  saucepan or deep fryer to 350 degrees. With a teaspoon, scoop some batter  and with your finger slid it into the oil. As hush puppies float to the  top, turn them so they brown evenly. Drain on paper towels. Makes about 3  dozen.
