Here is another "oldie but goodie" recipe that used to grace the counters  of many a diner along the side of the road. Top this cake with your  favorite chocolate or other frosting.    Melt the chocolate over low heat and set aside to cool. Sift the flour,  baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar together in to a large mixer  bowl. Add the brown sugar, 2/3 cup of sour milk, shortening, vanilla, and  red food coloring to the dry mixture. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes,  scraping the sides of the bowl several times while beating. Add the cooled  chocolate, 1/3 cup of sour milk and the eggs and continue to beat, at  medium speed, for an additional 2 minutes, or until well blended. Scrape  the sides of the bowl frequently. Pour into 2 9-inch prepared round cake  pans. (Prepare by greasing and flouring two 9-inch round cake pans.) Bake  in a preheat 375 degree F. oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until the cake  tests done.  Cool in the pan for 5 minutes and turn out on wire racks to  finish cooling until cold. Frost.    From The Mixer, Hand Mixer And Blender Cookbook Copyright 1955
