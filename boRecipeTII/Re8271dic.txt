Potato Pancakes #2
Salt, -(up to), Onions, Flour, Eggs, Oil or shortening, Large potatoes, 
Wash and peel the potatoes; place them in cold, salted water immediately so  they do not darken. Beat the eggs together with the flour and 1-1/2  teaspoon salt. Dry the potatoes and grate them coarsely. Peel and grate the  onions in a cloth and squeeze thoroughly. Immediately combine with egg  mixture. Heat the oil or shortening in a large skillet until it sputters.  Place the potato mixture by tablespoonsful in the hot fat, flattening each  with a spatula. Fry about 2 minutes on each side or until brown and crisp.  The thinner the cake, the better it tastes. Serve 4 to 6.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
