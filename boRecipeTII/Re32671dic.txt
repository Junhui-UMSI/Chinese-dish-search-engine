Jam or preserves; such as, Eggs; at room temperature,, Freshly grated lemon zest, All-purpose flour, GARNISH, Freshly grated orange zest, Whipped cream, Pure vanilla extract, Sugar, Finely ground yellow, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch spring form pan and dust it  with flour. Tap out the excess.    In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and cornmeal.    In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with an electric mixer just until  blended. Gradually beat in 1/2 cup of the sugar until the mixture is light  and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Beat in the lemon and orange zests and  the vanilla extract.    In a large bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites just until foamy.  Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until soft peaks form.  With a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture.  Gently fold in the dry ingredients. Scrape the mixture into the baking pan.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until the center is puffed and springs back when  touched in the center.    Unmold the cake onto a rack and let cool completely. With a long serrated  knife, cut the cake into 2 layers. Spread the bottom layer with the jam.  Replace the top of the cake.    Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and serve with dollops of whipped cream.
