Friends, I am today in a good mood, so I will share another recipe with  you. I found it in " JEWISH COOKING FOR PLEASURE", that my brother-in-law  gave me, after his wife passed away. I did not try it tho, but it seems  good to me.    Cooking time: 45 minutes.    Lightly grill the livers in the chicken fat and then dice them. Lightly fry  the carrots, onion and parsley. Put all the ingredients except the tomatoes  into a heavy covered saucepan and cook without stirring for about 30  minutes. Add the diced tomatoes and heat through. This dish is as colorful  as the robes of the Bokharian Jews. (I did not made this up, it is in the  book too...CCCCCCC)    VARIATIONS.    The turmeric can be omitted. The vegetables, rice and livers cubes can be  layerd to form a different pattern.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Coby Andel en Han Mauwer"  <hanmauwer@wxs.nl> on Nov 16, 1998,
