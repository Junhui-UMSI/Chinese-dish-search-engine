Dirt Cake
Whipped cream, Oreo cookies, Butter, Cream cheese, Powdered sugar, milk, Instant vanilla pudding mix, 
Make and serve this cake in a clean plastic flower pot. You can enhance the  effect by putting a couple "gummi worms" into the top of the cake, and  perhaps adding a plastic flower. The kids love this one.    Cream together the butter, cream cheese and powdered sugar.    Mix milk, pudding, and whipped cream. Fold into the butter-sugar mixture,  to make the filling.    Cover the hole in the bottom of the flower pot with a piece of waterproof  plastic tape. Put 1/3 of the crushed cookies on the bottom.    Cover with half of the filling    Cover with another third of the crushed cookies.    Cover with the rest of the filling, then the remaining cookies.    Refrigerate overnight.
