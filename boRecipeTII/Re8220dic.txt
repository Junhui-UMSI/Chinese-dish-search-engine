Potato Knishes (Passover)
Mashed potatoes, Eggs, Onions, Pepper, Cooking fat, Matzo meal, Salt, 
I havent tried the recipes, but they are from The Complete American-Jewish  Cookbook, which has a pretty good track-record, IMHO.    Mix potatoes, beaten eggs, meal, pepper and 2 tsp. salt. Brown onions in  hot fat and add 1 tsp. salt. Flatten small pancakes of the potato mixture  in the hand. cover with brown onions. Press another pancaked on top. roll  in matzo meal. Fry in hot fat or bake in hot oven (400F). Serves 6 to 8.    Variations: Meat or liver mixure can be used instead of onions.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest Volume 98 #005 by "Shoshana L.
