Sprinkle each row with salt before arranging the next row. Prop up  board at an angle to allow liquid to run off. Let stand 30 minutes.    2. Rinse lightly; pat dry on paper toweling. Beat eggs in shallow dish;  combine crumbs and cheese on wax paper. Dip each slice into egg mixture,  then into crumb mixture. Reserve any remaining crumbs.    3. Heat 2 Tablespoons of the oil in large skillet; saute slices a few at a  time; brown on both sides. Drain on paper toweling. Repeat, with more oil  as necessary.    4. Arrange in greased shallow ovenproof dish with a slice of tomato and  half a slice of cheese between eggplant slices. Sprinkle with Italian  seasoning, salt and pepper. If there are leftover crumbs, sprinkle over  top.    5. Bake in a moderate oven (375 degrees) for 20 minutes.    NOTE: This dish freezes well. Posted to EAT-L Digest 09 Mar 97 by  "Elizabeth A.
