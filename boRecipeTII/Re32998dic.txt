Basic Bruschetta
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Cloves of garlic, peeled and, Round loaf country bread,, 
Prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire.    Cut the middle portion of the round loaf into 6 long slices, each one  almost an inch thick. Cut these slices in half, making half-slices that are  roughly 3x3x1 inches.    When fire is ready, place the 12 slices over it in a single layer. Cook,  turning once, until the outsides of the bread are golden brown (with grill  marks, if possible). This should take about 2 minutes per side-but check  frequently to make sure the bread isnt burning.    When the bread slices are done, rub the edges of each one, on both sides,  with a cut clove of garlic-lightly or heavily, depending on your garlic  preference. Place the slices on a large platter in a single layer. Sprinkle  each slice with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, breaking the surface of the bread  lightly with a spoon to let the oil soak in. Season with salt and pepper.  Turn the slices over and repeat the procedure. Let the slices sit in the  olive oil for 10-15 minutes. Serve as is for simple bruschetta.
