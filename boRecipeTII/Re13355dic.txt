It is a popular "pre-drink"  food in Thai bars - I leave it to the reader to guess why!  fish and  shrimp balls are sold in Asian supermarkets. If you cant find them  use a little extra shrimp and crab.    Line a serving bowl with lettuce or kale leaves, Mix the non-seafood  ingredients in a saucepan, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the  seafood and stir occasionally until the seafood is just cooked. Pour  onto the bed of lettuse, and garnish with shredded lettuce, coriander  leaves, and slices of cucumber. (serves four as an appetiser).
