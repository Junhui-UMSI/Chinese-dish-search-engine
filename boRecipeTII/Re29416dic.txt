Coarsely chop the onion, red and green peppers. Clean stem and fine chop  the spinach. Chop mushrooms. Cook ziti and drain. Heat 1 tbs of oil over  medium heat saute the peppers about 5 minutes remove peppers with slotted  spoon and set aside. Put in the rest of the oil and saute onions about 3  minutes. Add the hamburger or suasage and brown stirring to break up the  meat.  Add garlic and mushrooms and saute 2 more minutes. Drain the excess  fat and grease.  Break up the tomatoes with fork and add with the tomato  sauce, wine, basil, salt, black pepper, and oregano. Bring to boil. Lower  heat and cook uncovered about 20 minutes. Add spinach and corn cooking  until spinach wilts. Preheat oven 375 degrees. Coat 2 1/2 quart casserole  dish with oil spray. Combine ziti, tomato mixture, ricotta, and 2/3rds of  peppers in large bowl then spoon into casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with  parmesan. Bake 25 minutes and garnish with rest of peppers after removal.  Can substitute chopped brocolli for the fresh spinach, we like it better.
