Banana Bread
Sugar, Shortening, Eggs, Baking Powder, Sifted unbleached flour, Or 4 very ripe bananas, Salt, Chopped pecans or walnuts,, 
You can turn a yeast bread into a vegetable bread (or fruit bread) simply  by taking 1 cup of vegetable puree or fruit puree and substituting it for a  cup of the flour in a basic sweet bread or white bread recipe. (If its a  watery puree, you might have to add additional flour, or try using it as a  substitute for some of the oil or liquid instead.) You could try this as a  basis for a quickbread - its the best banana bread Ive ever tasted:    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Beat shortening in mixer until creamy. Add sugar and eggs, continue beating  at medium speed one minute. Add bananas to egg mixture. Mix until blended.  Add flour mixture, beating at low speed only until blended. Turn into  buttered loaf pan and bake for 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in center  of loaf comes out clean.

For a little spice, I add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp mace and 1/4  tsp nutmeg and sift them in with the flour mixture. Use 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups  of pumpkin puree instead of the banana and put in 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie  spice, and you should end up with a nice, moist pumpkin bread.    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.
