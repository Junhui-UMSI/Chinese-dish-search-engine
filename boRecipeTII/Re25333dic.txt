(This recipe is from Dal Pescatore, just north of Parma, Italy,"considered  by many to be the best restaurant in the entire country" sez the Times, so  it must be true.)MR      This filling takes some adjusting to resemble the stuff the Santinis  brought from home. Their Mostarda, which they make themselves every year,  had a mustard-y bite that nearly brought tears to our eyes. The stuff we  bought here, in an Italian specialty store, was much sweeter, so we added a  bit of dried mustard to crank up the heat. Also, since we could find  neither yellow pumpkin nor Hubbbard squash on the day we shopped for  testing materials, we used acorn squash. It worked fairly well but required  some additional bread crumbs to become firm enough to hold together  properly. When its done, the flavors are explosive and almost medieval,  combining sweet squash with mustard-y hot mostarda and rich cheese and  butter.    Prepare filling up to 2 days in advance, but definitely before pasta is  rolled out. Cut pumpkin or squash in sections, remove seeds. In pan bake at  350 degrees until tender. Pass through food mill into large bowl. Add  Mostarda, amaretti, 2 tb cheese and dash of ground nutmeg. Season to taste  with salt and pepper. Mix well and taste. Filling should have definite  mustard-heat. If not, add up to 1 ts dried mustard. Filling should also be  fairly firm and loosly hold together when formed in ball. If not, add up to        2 tb bread crumbs.    In bowl mix flour and eggs. Knead into smooth ball and wrap in plastic  wrap. Set aside at least 1/2 hour. Devide in quarters and work with 1  portion at a time, keeping rest tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. Knead and  roll out on pasta machine to next-to-thinnest setting. Cut into long strip  and cut strip at 2-inch intervals into squares.    Place ball of stuffing slightly smaller than walnut in center of each  rectangle. Diagonally fold over 1 corner of rectangle to meet opposite  corner. Press to seal. Fold base of triangle over to form "paper hat" shape  and prell sides to seal. Set aside on floured kitchen towel and repeat  until all dough is used up.    Sprinkle heated serving dish with 1 1/2 tb cheese. Melt butter in  saucepan. Cook tortelli in abundant boiling, salted water 4 to 5 minutes,  until pasta is cooked. Remove with slotted spoon, working carefully to  avoid breaking pasta. Place tortelli over cheese in serving dish. Sprinkle  with another 1 1/2 tb cheese. Pour melted butter over. Toss gently. Makes 8  servings.

(MR notes: Ratio of egg to flour may need to be juggled to get right  texture, depending on flour used. If filling needs more heat, consider  using Japanese horseradish.) L A Times, 3/17/94.
