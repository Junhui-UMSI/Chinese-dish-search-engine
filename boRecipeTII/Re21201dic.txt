Mix grated onions with eggs, oil, baking powder, salt and cold water. Add  enough flour to make a soft but rollable dough, let rest in the fridge  about 30 minutes. Flour a wooden board and oil a rolling pin. Working with  about a third of the dough at a time, roll it out to 1/2 inch thick, cut it  into strips and then cut the strips into diamonds, prick the dough allover  with a fork. Place on a well oiled cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 350  F oven for about 1/2 hour, until bottoms are golden brown.
