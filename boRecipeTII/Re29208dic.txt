In a shallow baking dish (or small quiche dishes), pour in part of the  sauce. Place the shrimp around the rim (or rims) with tails over the side,  being sure the meat is well coated. Mix the bread crumbs with the remaining  sauce and sprinkle over the dish. Bake 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm with  slices of sourdough.

The shrimp cant carry all the  delicious sauce however. Serve a loaf of warm, sliced sourdough for  dipping.
