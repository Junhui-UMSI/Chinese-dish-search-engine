To make beans, combine 10 cups of water, green pepper, and 1 garlic clove.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the beans are  tender enough to crush with a spoon on the side of pan and most of the  liquid is absorbed, about 2 1/2 hours.  Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium  skillet over low heat.  Add onions, green pepper, red pepper, and remaining  garlic cloves.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring, until onions and  peppers are golden, about 15 minutes.  Season with cumin and black pepper.  Stir cooked vegetables into the beans.  Cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring  often and adding as much of the chicken broth as needed to keep the beans a  thick consistency without sticking.  Taste and correct the seasoning. To  cook rice, heat 1/4 cup broth to boiling in a small saucepan. Cover and let  stand for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a saucepan heat oil over low heat. Add  rice and garlic, and cook, stirring, just until rice is coated and the  garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.  Do not brown. Stir in turmeric,  remaining broth and broth mixture.  Heat to boiling, stirring once. Cook  covered, over low heat until broth is absorbed and rice is tender, about 12  minutes.  Spoon rice into large serving platter. Ladle beans on top.
