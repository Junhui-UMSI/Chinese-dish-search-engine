Shred or dice the braised beef.  Place in pot with consomme, green onions,  garlic, and parsley.  Bring to boil and simmer until onions are no longer  crunchy.  Add peppers and taste for seasoning- should be highly flavored  because it will be cold. It may not need salt because of the consomme.  Soften gelatin in cool water, and add to pot.  Cook and stir until gelatin  is dissolved. Spoon a small amount into a custard cup, and place in fridge  or freezer while daube is cooling so you can have a taste. Allow rest of  recipe to stand until lukewarm. When sample has gelled, place it on a  cracker and taste to see about seasonings, and also to decide if you want  pickles or olives in it.  If that appeals to you, add 1/2 cup chopped  olives or dill pickles squeezed dry after chopping. Pour everything into a  rectangular mold to be sliced and served on lettuce, or into tiny  individual molds to serve on crackers.   I like a flexible container,  because its so easy to unmold.    Chill until really firm-- over night is safest.  Remove any fat which may  be on top. Unmold onto a platter lined with nice greens to serve as an  appetizer or light meal. A bit of mayo mixed with horseradish makes an  appropriate sauce, placed on the side. To serve on crackers, a little dab  of horseradish on the cracker first is good.
