Cut the block of tofu into 1/2- to 1-inch thick slabs. Freeze the slabs for  a minimum of one day (a maximum of three months) and then thaw. Place the  thawed slices on a very clean, dry kitchen/tea towel and wrap the towel  around the slices. Place a heavy baking dish on top of the towel-wrapped  tofu, and allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Unwrap and crumble the tofu,  using a fork to mash it if necessary, until the desired texture is reached.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well, adjusting seasonings to taste.  If desired, thin with a little broth dissolved in boiling water (thinned  out it makes a really nice dip). Chill overnight before serving, to allow  flavours to blend.
