Pack beef into ungreased 10-inch skillet on medium heat. Cover and let  simmer, reducing to low heat after 5 minutes. You dont really want to  overbrown the beef, but to allow some moisture to combine with the natural  fat in the chuck to create a broth while it simmer. Depending on the  percentage of fat content in the beef, Id let it steam like this for about  12-15 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain liquid from beef into blender with HALF  of the beef.  With on/off speed blend this mixture until it resembles a  brick-layers mortar. NOW-W-W... to the mixture of pulvarized beef and the  remaining half which you did not put into the blender, add onion, green  pepper, mustard seed, bouillon powder and chili powder. Stir in hot pepper  sauce, cumin powder, chili sauce, sweet pickle relish, tomato paste, water,  molasses and beef broth. (If you like a thinner sauce, add more beef  broth).  Simmer this uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent scorching or  use your slow cooker on "high" for about 2 hours. On top of the range,  simmer 1 hour, adding additional liquid as necessary to keep sauce  consistency.  Spoon it into the fried taco shells (use frozen & cheat a  little if you want to). Top it off with shredded lettuce, grated cheese and  Taco 5 Alarm Sauce.
