This comes from the El Paso Chile Companys book "Chiles" by W. Park Kerr  (which I mentioned in a previous posting to this list):    I keep a bottle of this incredible concoction in the freezer, poised to  pour into chilled martini glass, just in case I have an emergency situation  that calls for an attitude adjustment. Try it poured into tomato juice for  a breathtaking eye-opener, or drink shots to accompany a platter of chilled  shellfish.    Pour off about 1/2 cup of the tequila and reserve for another use.    Drop the jalapenos, green onion, serrano, chile de arbol, garlic clove  halves, and lime zest into the bottle. Cover and let stand at room  temperature for       48    hours.    Store the bottle in the freezer. The tequila will become think and syrupy.  Serve directly from the freezer.    Makes about 3 cups.    The recipe in the book is accompanied by an appealing photo of the chilled  bottle with the red, green and orange forms of the submerged fruit  appearing hazily through the frost on the glass. Truly a beautiful sight.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by The Old Bear <oldbear@arctos.com> on Sep  27, 1998,
