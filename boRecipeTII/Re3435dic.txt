Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prepare pastry in deep-dish pie plate. In  small bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla,  and 1 egg. Beat at medium speed until well blended. Spread in bottom of  pastry-lined pan. Sprinkle with pecans.    In small bowl, combine all topping ingredients. Beat on medium speed just  until well blended. Gently pour topping over pecans. Bake at 375 degrees  for 35-40 minutes, or until center is firm to touch. Store leftovers in  refrigerator. Makes 8-10 servings.    Note: Cut the slices small for this pie is quite rich.    the first time I made this was for a PTO dessert dinner when Rebekah was in  Kindergarten (shes now in college). I think I got it out of a Pillsbury  bake-off booklet, but I dont have that included with my recipe, and its  been too long ago to remember.
