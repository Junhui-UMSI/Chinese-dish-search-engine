In a large bowl sift first 5 ingredients.  In small bowl beat remaining 4  ingredients until creamy.  Combine and mix well.  Pour into a 13 x 9 baking  pan sprayed with non-stick spray.  Bake at 375 (350 glass) 15-20 minutes.  Poke with a toothpick and if it comes out with fudgy crumbs, its done.  Do  not overbake!  Cool completely before cutting into pieces.  You can add  chopped nuts, however it will raise the fat content substantially.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
