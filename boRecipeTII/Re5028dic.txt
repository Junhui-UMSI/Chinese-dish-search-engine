Pickled Tongue or Beef
Large-grained kosher salt, Bay leaves; crumbled, Saltpeter (optiona) can be, Nutmeg, Warm water, Brown sugar, Ground ginger, Garlic, Ground cloves, Paprika, Black Pepper, 4-pound tongue brisket of, 
The Corned Beef I recipe in the archives from Joan Nathans Jewish Cooking  in America is also for pickled tongue (and listed as such in the book).    1. Wash and remove most of the fat from the tongue or brisket. Mix together  all the spices and the garlic and rub well into the brisket.    2. Dissolve the salt peter in the warm water and pour over the meat. Place  in a large, nonmetal container. Weight the meat down with a stone or brick  and cover it with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. (You can also place the  ingredients in a plastic bag and weight it down.) Refrigerate for 10 days  to 2 weeks. Turn the meat every 2 to 3 days.    3. Place the meat in a large pot of cold water. Bring to a boil and throw  away the water. Repeat 3 times.    4. Cover with cold again, bring to a boil, and cook over low heat, covered,  for about 2 hours or until tender. If cooking tongue, peel ff the skin  while still warm. Cool, slice thin, and place on a platter. Serve with  mustard or horseradish.    NOTES : I grew up with corned beef and pickled tonque sandwiches, only  Pastrami or maybe Lox on a bagel can come close to the orgasmic delight of  munching these delights..traditionally made "a la Bumpstead", that is  slathered with mustard, piled high with meat, tomatoes, pickles, sliced  onions (for those that arent wimpy) and anything else that lights your  fire. While Ive prepared tongue other ways, I enjoy the pickeled variety  sliced thick between slices of fresh Jewish rye the best.
