From: plgold@ix.netcom.com    Date: 19 Oct 1995 21:16:48 -0600    Here is a recipe for Injeera and also 2 recipes for sauces from "Sephardic  Cooking", Copeland Marks.  In Ethiopia the injeera are prepared with teff,  a grain of the millet family, but this recipe calls white flour.    1.  Stir-fry the onion and garlic in a dry pan over moderately low heat for  2 minutes. Add the oil and stir-fry for 1 minute.    2.  Add the mashed peas, tumeric, salt and chili; mix well.  Add the water  and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to reduce the mixture to a thick, green,  well-spiced puree. Serve warm with injeera (see recipe). Variation: If you  substitute 1 cup of red Egyptian lentils for the green split peas and  follow the same instructions, you will have Misr Allecha.
