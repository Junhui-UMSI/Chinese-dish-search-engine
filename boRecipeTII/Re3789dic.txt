Fresh parsley, Fresh thyme, Whole chickens, olive oil, Fresh sage, Fresh mint, Fresh Oregano, Fresh rosemary, 
Halve chickens and set aside. Place herbs in a bowl and combine just enough  olive oil to create a wet rub for the chickens.    Heat an outdoor grill until coals are red hot. Place chickens on the grill  and a brick on top to weigh them down. Cook until meat is cooked through.  Continue to use the brick while cooking chicken on both sides. Served with  roast smashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.
