Spread apple mixture over flattened pork loin, leaving a 1/2 inch border;  rll up pork loin, jellyroll fashion, starting with long side.    Tie rolled loin. Place on a rack coated with cooking spray; place rack in a  shallow roasting pan. Coat loin with cooking spray; sprinkle with Italian  seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon salt.    Bake covered, at 350 for 1 hour and 5 minutes or until a meat thermometer  registers 160. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.    Whisk cornstarch and next 3 ingredients in a small heavy saucepan. Bring  mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. Boil, whisking  constantly, 1 minute. Serve with stuffed pork loin. Garnish, if desired.  Makes 6 servings.    Note: To prepare pork loin for stuffing, slice pork loin lengthwise down  the center, cutting to, but not through the bottom. Starting from center  cut, make a horizontal cut toward 1 side, stopping 1/2 inch from edge.  Repeat on opposite side. Unfold loin so that it is flat.    Flatten loin evenly to about a 12x8 inch rectangle using a meat mallet or  rolling pin.    After stuffing and rolling, tie the loin at 2 inch intervals with heavy  string or kitchen twine. Be sure to bake seam side down.    Recipe by: Americas Best Loved Recipes    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #995 by L979 <L979@aol.com> on Jan 8, 1998
