Toasted Pecan Scones
Sugar, All-purpose flour, milk, Sticks cold, unsalted, Double-acting baking powder, Eggs, Finely chopped toasted, 
In a food processor, process the flour, the baking powder, the sugar, and  the butter until the mixture just resembles coarse meal. In a small bowl  whisk together the eggs and the milk, add the mixture to the processor, and  blend the dough, pulsing the motor, until it is just combined. Turn the  dough out onto a floured surface and knead in the pecans. Roll or pat the  dough 1/2 inch thick, with a 2" cutter cut out rounds, and transfer them to  a greased baking sheet. Bake the rounds in the middle of a preheated 425  degree oven for 14 minutes, or until they are pale golden. Makes 30 scones.
