Pepper Chicken
Cream of mushroom soup, Butter or margarine, Chicken breasts, mushrooms, Teryaki sauce, milk, Salt, pepper & chili, 
Melt the butter in an 8" skillet or fry pan, add chicken, salt, pepper and  some chili powder. When chicken is browned on both sides remove it to a  plate. Put the cream of mushroom soup in the skillet, add teriyaki sauce  and milk mixing until soup is smooth. Add more salt, pepper and chili  powder to taste. Add mushrooms if desired, fresh or canned. Put cooked  chicken pieces back into skillet until thoroughly warmed and covered in  sauce. You may need little more milk if you have a lot of chicken. There is  normally enough sauce to cover the chicken and some for the rice, noodles  or mashed potatoes served with it. The sauce should have a mellow taste not  to cover up the chicken but normally has a spicy, warm aftershock.  Preparation Time: Less than 25 minutes. ~--
