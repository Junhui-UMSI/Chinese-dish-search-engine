There have been a number of good polenta suggestions...here is one that we  enjoyed earlier this summer.  It was one of those hot days, so I chilled  the polenta in a loaf pan, and just sliced it (without dry-frying or  anything).  On top I put white beans and sage. Its an adaptation of a  recipe from Fields of Greens (called Warm Cannellini Beans with Sage, p.  270, for those of you with this cookbook)    Put the beans into a saucepan with the bay leaf, savory and two of the sage  leaves.  Warm gently until you need them, so that they take in the herb  flavors.  Remove the herbs and bay leaf, leave the beans in their broth.    While the beans cook, chop the remaining sage leaves. Water-saute the  onion, 1/2 t salt, and a few pinches of pepper.  Saute (Ill probably use  water next time; I tried wine, but I thought it made the whole thing to  wine-y.) over medium heat until the onion begins to release its juices. Add  the garlic and sage; saute for about 10 minutes, then add the wine and cook  for a minute or two, until the pan is nearly dry.    Add the beans and their broth to the onions along with 1/2 t salt and a few  pinches of pepper.  Lower the heat and cook for 20 minutes, adding alittle  water if needed to keep the beans saucy.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Add  the parsley just before serving.    From: Cindy_Bloch@transarc.com. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10 Issue 1] August  11, 1994.
