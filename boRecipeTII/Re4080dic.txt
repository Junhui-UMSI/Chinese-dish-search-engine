Peppermint Taffy
Vinegar, Butter or margarine, Light corn syrup, Peppermint extract, 
Put all ingredients except flavoring in large heavy saucepan. Bring to  boil, and cook until a small amount of mixture forms a hard ball when  dropped in very cold water (254 degrees F. on a candy thermometer). Pour  onto a large buttered platter. As edges cool, turn mixture toward center  with a spatula. When just cool enough to handle make a hollow in center of  taffy and add a few drops of flavoring. Gather up taffy and pull until  light, using a little butter to grease hands while pulling. twist into a  long rope and cut into pieces with scissors. Wrap each piece in wax paper  and store in a cool dry place. Makes about 1 1/4 pounds.
