Twice Cooked "Fries"
Potatoes, 
From: ac002@lafn.org (Michael Block)    Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 11:34:13 -0700  I didnt copy the recipe, but its pretty simple...    Step One:  Place Scrubbed potatoes into boiling water.  Boil for 15 minutes  then remove from the water and let them cool a little.    Step Two:  Slice the potatoes to desirable size.  (I try to keep the the  skin on, but youll find that it wants to come off w/ the knife).    Step Three:  Place the potato slices on a no-stick cookie sheet (I use a  spray on a regular cookie sheet) and put in a pre-heated oven at 450-500  deg. After 10-15 minutes turn the "fries" over so that they are evenly  cooked. Remove after another 10-15 minutes (or when done).    NOTE:  This works well in my toaster oven as well as my regular oven.  My  SO says they are GREAT! We eat them w/ malt vinegar, mustard or spicy bbq  sauce    fatfree digest V96 #192    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
