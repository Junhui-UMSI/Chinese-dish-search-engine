Vegetarian Marshmallow
Sugar, Egg whites, Light corn syrup, 
Beat the egg whites in a heat resistant bowl until they get very fluffy .  Put the bowl in a water bath and add syrup. Keep on beating. Add the sugar  (to harden the mixture) and keep on beating. Youll need 2 spoons or so,  depending on the size of the eggs used. After 10-15 minutes the mixture  will be cooked and harden after it cools down. Keeps in refrigerator for a  day or so and then it starts to colapse. Serve over sorbet, cakes or eat by  the spoon.
