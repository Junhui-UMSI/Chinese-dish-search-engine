Sweet-Hot Holiday Grapes
Green seedless grapes, Water, Sugar, Jalapenos; seeded and, Cider vinegar, Red Flame seedless grapes, 
Last night I had a class with food scientist/writer Shirley Corriher.  Thought yall might be interested in one of the appetizers...  it wasnt  very hot, so I would increase the peppers. Quite a surprise on the ol  holiday buffet, or ringing the bird!    Remove from their stems 1 3/4 Cups each red flame and green seedless  grapes; rinse and place in medium bowl. (Will be approx. 1 1/2 pounds of  grapes.)    Simmer in medium saucepan over low heat for 10 minutes:  1 Cup sugar, 2/3  Cup cider vinegar, 1 Cup water and 4 large jalapenos that have been seeded  and quartered.    Pour mixture over grapes.  (Add a little water if necessary so grapes are  completely covered.)  Cover with plastic wrap and marinate at room  temperature overnight. Serve cold or at room temperature. Keeps  refrigerated 5-6 days.    I noticed that the green grapes are slightly discolored at the end b/c of  the vinegar, but its not bad.  Might arrange so you dont see it, or just  use red ones...    Vicki Braun <braun@use1.eglin.af.mil>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
