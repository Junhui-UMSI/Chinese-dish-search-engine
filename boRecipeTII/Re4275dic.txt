Press cottage cheese through potato ricer or sieve. Add to flour, baking  soda and salt. Rub well together. Mix oil, water and beaten eggs and add to  flour mixture. Knead and add more flour if needed to make a rather sticky  dough (not dry). Pinch off a piece of dough, flatten in the palm of your  hand and fill with a mixture of mashed potato, Cheez Whiz, bacon pieces  (optional), salt & pepper to taste. Deep fry until brown. These also freeze  well. This dish is typical of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
