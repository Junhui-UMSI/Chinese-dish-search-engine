* Vegetarian use vegetable stock rather than chicken stock. 1. To make  sauce: In a 2 quart saucepan over medium-low heat, saute the celery and  onions in the stock for about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil,  vinegar and oregano. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Set aside while you  make the rolls. 2. To make the cabbage rolls: In a small saucepan over low  heat, saute the onions, mushrooms and garlic in the stock for 3 to 5  minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the rice or barley, tomatoes,  bread crumbs, soy sauce, parsley, curry and pepper. 3. Blanch the cabbage  leaves in boiling water for about 3 minutes, or until pliable. Drain. Place  about 1/2 cup of mixture on each leaf. Roll the leaf tightly to enclose the  filling. 4. Coat a 9x9 baking dish with no-stick spray. Add the rolls, seam  side down. Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce over the rolls. Cover with foil  and bake at 400 F for 25 to 35 minutes. Serve the heated cabbage rolls with  the remaining sauce.

I usually freeze the head of cabbage so that I dont have to use  the boiling water method to separate the leaves and end up with scalded  fingers.
