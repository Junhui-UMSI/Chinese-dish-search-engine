Apple Wedges
(optional), Apples -- pared, cored and, Salt, Baking Powder, Fin, Flour, Sugar, Eggs whites, Orange extract --, 
Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl.  In a large bowl,  beat the eggs and orange extract until frothy.  Add sugar to the egg  mixture and then add the flour.  Stir to mix.  The dough will be a little  stiff. Add the apples and the raisins.  Mix well. Pour the mixture into a  round pie pan.  You can spray the pie pan w/ oil or not. I have tried both.  It sticks a little bit if you dont spray it. Bake at 325 degrees until the  top browns or toothpick inserted in middle of pie comes out clean.
