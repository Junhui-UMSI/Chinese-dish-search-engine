Stuffed Chicken Breasts
Salt, Nutmeg; to taste, Eggs; slightly beaten, Butter, Onions; finely chopped, Frozen spinach, Black Pepper, Coarsely chopped parsley, Whole-milk ricotta cheese, Fresh herbs, Halves of chicken breast, 
Saute the onions in butter until soft.  Combine with the other ingredients  (except chicken) and mix well. Season highly. Place each breast skin side  up on a board. Trim away excess fat. Loosen skin from 1 side of breast and  stuff approximately 1/3 cup of the filling under the skin. Tuck the skin  and meat under breast, forming an even, round, dome shape. Put the stuffed  breasts in a buttered Pyrex or metal baking dish. Fifteen minutes before  baking, preheat over to 350 F (175 C). Bake breasts until golden brown,  about 30 to 35 minutes. Dont overcook or chicken will be dry. Cool  slightly before serving, and cool to room temperature if you are going to  slice into smaller serving pieces. Arrange on platters and decorate with  fresh herbs.
