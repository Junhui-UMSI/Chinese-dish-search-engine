Yummy Sandwich Bread
Active dry yeast, Bread flour, Ground ginger, Water, Water, Whole-wheat flour, Butter, , Sugar, Salt, Brown Sugar, 
Yield:  2 standard-sized loaves (using loaf pans)    Insert metal blade in work bowl of food processor.  Add flours, sugars,  salt, ginger, and butter; process for approx. 20 seconds.  Add yeast and  process for approximately 10 seconds more to fully mix the ingredients.    Add water; process until dough forms a ball in the work bowl.  Insert dough  blade and continue processing for approximately 2 minutes.  Remove dough to  greased glass container; cover loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap.    Set in a warm, draft-free location until doubled in bulk; punch down.  Repeat.    Punch down dough; divide into two equal-sized pieces.  Form into loaves and  place in lightly greased (I use Pam cooking spray) loaf pans.  Cover  loosely with tea towel or plastic wrap; place in warm, draft-free location  until dough reaches the top of the loaf pans.    Preheat oven to 375F.  Uncover loaves and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove  loaves from pans and place back into oven, baking for 10 more minutes.  Remove to cooling racks and cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing. If  freezing loaves for later use, cool thoroughly (about 90 minutes).    This recipe yields an extremely fluffy, airy loaf with a very pleasant  texture which is perfect for making toast and sandwiches.    NOTE:  I have doubled this recipe when using my KitchenAid with excellent  results.    >From: cmathew@iadfw.net (Craig & Joan Mathew)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
