Place the basil leaves, olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, pepper, sugar, salt  and 2 tablespoons hot water in a blender and puree. Arrange the tuna steaks  in a baking dish large enough to hold them in a single layer. Pour the  marinade over the fish.  Cover and marinate for 3-4 hours in the  refrigerator - turning the steaks occasionally. Prepare coals for grilling  for preheat the broiler.    Drain the tuna steaks and grill them over medium-hot coals or broil 4-5  inches from he heat until charred on the outside but still pink in the  center - about 3 minutes - turning the steaks once. Do not overcook. Remove  from the heat and place the steaks on warmed dinner plates. Melt 2  tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add to the  skillet the banana, pineapple, mango, papaya, fresh cilantro leaves, lemon  juice and sugar.    Saute just until the mixture is heated through - about 30 seconds. Do not  overcook.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon  the sauteed fruit mixture over the tuna and serve immediately.
