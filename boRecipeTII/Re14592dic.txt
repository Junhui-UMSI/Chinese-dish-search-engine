"Knatten"S Wormwood Rice Wine for Cooking
Sugar, Rice, Yeast (baking), Boiled water, Wormwood, Raisins, 
Put rice and water directly into the container. Scald the raisins before  adding them as they contain wild yeast. Stir the yeast in some lukewarm  water and add to the container together with the boiled water which is now  also lukewarm. A bag made of cheese cloth (or equivalent) measuring  10"*16" filled with dried wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and a stone is  placed at the bottom of the container. Stir as frequently as possible for  the next 8 days. Then leave for 2-3 months before bottling.  This wine is very dry and perfect for cooking (use instead of white wine  or sherry).
