Mix red onion, 4 tablespoons oil and rosemary in bowl. Rub  onion mixture over veal. Cover; chill overnight.    Preheat oven to 400F. Scrape onion mixture off veal. Heat 2 tablespoons  oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add veal and brown well on all  sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer veal to roasting pan. Roast until  thermometer inserted into center registers 130F for medium-rare, about 35  minutes. Transfer meat to platter. Let stand 5 minutes.    Cut meat into 1/2 inch thick slices. Arrange on plates. Add veal juices to  ragout. Bring to simmer. Serve with veal.    For the Ragout: Cook onions in large pot of boiling water 2 minutes. Drain  and cool. Peel onions.    Preheat oven to 400F. Transfer onions to rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with  oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss to coat.
