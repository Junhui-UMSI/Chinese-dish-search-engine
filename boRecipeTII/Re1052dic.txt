Company Carrots
CARROTS, JULLIENNED, Butter, Sugar, Paprika, LEMON, JUICED, 
CUT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF CARROTS INTO STRIPS - SO YOU HAVE 2 CUPFULS.  COOK THEM UNTIL THEY ARE TENDER AND DRAIN. MIX REMAINING INGREDIENTS IN A  SKILLET AND BRING TO A BOIL. ADD CARROTS, SAUTEE FOR APPROXIMATELY 10  MINUTES, STIRRING SO THEY CAN GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE SAUCE.
