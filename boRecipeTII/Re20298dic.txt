Heat 1 tb of the  margarine and 1 tb of the oil in 10" skillet over medium heat until hot.  Cook half of the cutlets in margarine mixture, turning once, until done,  about 10 minutes. Remove veal; keep warm. Repeat with remaing margarine,  oil and veal. Cook asparagus as directed on package; drain. Prepare  Hollandaise Sauce. Place 3 to 4 asparagus spears on top of each cutlet; add  some crabmeat and spoon sauce over top. HOLLANDAISE SAUCE: Stir egg yolks  and lemon juice vigorously in 1 1/2-qt saucepan. Add 1/4 c of the butter.  Heat over very low heat, stirring constantly, until butter is melted. Add  remaining butter. Continue stirring vigorously until butter is melted and  sauce is thickened. (Be sure butter melts slowly as this gives eggs time to  cook    and thicken sauce without curdling) Lisa FROM: LISA HLAVATY (FDGN81A)    Posted on MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #145, 26 May 1996
