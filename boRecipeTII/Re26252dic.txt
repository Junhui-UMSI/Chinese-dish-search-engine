Dice 1 Fresh Habanero.  Place tomatillo and hab in a tightly wrapped foil packet and toss it onto  the coals of a nice fire. roast for 2 minutes on each side. remove from  fire and let cool for a few minutes.    place pizza dough in a well seasoned Cast Iron Skillet.  (we coasted teh  insode of the pan w/ Chile Oil.)    Top w/ pizza sauce, the tomatillo/hab mixture, some ground dried habs, and  cheese and then place the cast Iron pan directly on a bed of hot coals and  cook for about 5 minutes or untill cheese melts, be care full that the  bottom does not burn.
