From: Stephanie Elzer <elzer@cis.udel.edu>    Date: 21 Oct 1994 13:14:40 -0400    Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease or butter square casserole dish. Place  apples in casserole dish and sprinkle with orange juice.  Mix together the  sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and butter until crumbly.  Do not over  process. Sprinkle this topping mixture over the apples. Bake for  approximately 45 minutes, or until apples are tender. The quantities listed  above tend to make quite a bit of the topping, you may want to cut back  although we never do, since the topping is our favorite part!
