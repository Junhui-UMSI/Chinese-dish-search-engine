Racks of Lamb with Lemon and Mint
Chopped fresh mint (or, Lemon Rind, Lemon juice, 1 tsp dried), Racks of lamb (ea.3/4 lb.), Pinch of pepper, Vegetable oil, LEMON MINT MARINADE:, 
Place each rack of lamb, meaty side up, on cutting board. Using sharp  paring knife, cut line across rack where meaty portion begins, about 3  inches down from rib ends. Cut off layer of fat between line and rib ends.    Cut off meat and fat between bared ribs to expose bones. Scrape exposed rib  bones clean, removing any remaining meat and fat. Trim fat from meaty  portion of ribs to 1/8 inch thickness, lifting away fat as you work.    With rib ends up, press racks together to interlink bones. Separate bases  about 1 inch to stabilize; place in shallow dish.    LEMON MINT MARINADE:  Whisk together mint, lemon rind and juice, oil and  pepper; brush over lamb.  Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.    Place lamb on greased rack in roasting pan; drizzle with any remaining  marinade.  Cover exposed ribs with foil to prevent charring. Roast in 450F  oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325F; roast for 40 minutes or until  meat thermometer registers 140F for rare and 150F for medium-rare.    Transfer to warm platter; tent with foil and let stand for 10 minutes. To  serve, remove all foil; carve between bones. Makes 4 servings.
