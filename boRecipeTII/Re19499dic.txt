Angels on Horseback
Wiener Buns, Toothpicks, Strips Bacon; thinly sliced, Cooking forks, Wieners, Strips Cheese; 2 1/2 X 1/4 ", 
Slit lengthwise pockets in 8 wieners, long enough to hold one strip of  cheese. Tuck in a strip of cheese into each pocket. Wind a strip of bacon  around each wiener so the pocket and cheese are completely covered. Fasten  each end of bacon to the wiener with a toothpick. Put each wiener on a  cooking fork and bake over hot coals until bacon is cooked. When angel is  done remove it from the fork and put in a wiener bun. Take out toothpicks  before eating.
