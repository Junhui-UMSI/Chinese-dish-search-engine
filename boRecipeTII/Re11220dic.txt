RAISIN SAUCE: Mix together the brown sugar, mustard, and flour. Add the  raisins, vinegar, and flour. Cook slowly until thickened and the floury  taste is gone.    SPICY RAISIN SAUCE: * ( Ive liked red currant jelly) Heat the sugar in the  water until the sugar dissolves. Add remaining ingredients and cook until  the jelly melts. (from Fannie Farmer, 11th ed., 1965)    Here are two recipes I have used many times. As you can see, they are quite  different. Which one I make is whichever one hits me right when Im ready  to make it. GARY BRAMMER (BBFT81A)  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #455 by Martha Sheppard  <marthahs@ix.netcom.com> on Dec 16, 1997
