[NOTE: Grand prize winner from the 1992 Startext Christmas Recipe contest.  Entered by David Duke.]    I kept everything except the ground red pepper in the recipe. I replaced  the pepper with 1 tsp of Habanero powder which has a delay of its own  built in. Other than that, everything that the author states is true. It  really does work, and is pretty tasty also.    Blend in a small pot over low heat. Stir gently till bubbly dont burn the  stuff. Then allow to cool and put in a small crock pot (the one you got  left over from the school PTA cheese sale) By the way this stuff will keep  almost forever! The best medium to serve this disguised taste bud screamer  is on Wheat Thins by Nabisco or Triscut for the healthy nuts.    The really strange thing about this little trick is that it has three  different things that happen. First is that your taste buds get the sweet  from the honey. Second a mild taste of peanut butter. THEN **KABOOM** RED  PEPPER! ILL SWEAR THAT THIS WORKS! It should take from a count of eight to  ten seconds for the grenade to go off and you oughta watch the faces of the  UNSUSPECTED!
