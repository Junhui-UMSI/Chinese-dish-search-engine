Ancho-Cheese Bread
Provolone cheese; grated, Water, Nonfat dry milk powder, Active dry yeast, Salt, Granulated sugar, Bread flour, Whole ancho peppers; ground, 
All items should be at room temperature. Remove stems and seeds from ancho  peppers and grind in a spice mill or grinder. Add ingredients to bread  machine in order except cheese which is added during final kneading. Bake  at regular setting for 1-1/2 Lb loaf.    Serving Ideas : Great with soups or stews    NOTES : This is a bread machine recipe.  I have used Calvins Powder for  this recipe.  If you do not have it, feel free to substitute another  powdered hot pepper.  I have only used 1 teaspoon as it adds heat without  being overwhelming. You can add more to suit your tastes, but watch how  much more you add as it will affect the consistency of the dough. You can  also substitute sharp cheddar cheese for the provolone. The ground anchos  add wonderful flavor and a nice orange color to the bread.
