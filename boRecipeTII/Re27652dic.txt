(from Helen Witty)    "The firepower of the peanuts (or almonds if you wuld like) can be  increased by stepping up the hot red pepper, but be warned -- the recipe  supplies enough warmth for most palates."    Combine the first eight ingredients in a blender or food processor -- blemd  well. Add egg whites. Blend. Pour over peanuts and let the peanuts sit at  least 30 minutes, stirring them several times.    Preheat oven to 250 in the meantime and oil two baking sheets. Drain the  nuts in a seive, reserving the liquid. Spread the nuts out on the baking  sheets and bake about ten munutes. Drizzle the extra liquid on the nuts.  Bake an additional 15 minutes, turn off oven, stir nuts. Let cool  completely while still in oven and store in airtight containers.
