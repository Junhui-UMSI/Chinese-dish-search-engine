In small batches saute the meat in the olive oil until all the liquid is  gone and the meat is lightly browned. Pour off any excess grease. Add the  salt, pepper, chicken broth, {reserve some to mix with the cornstarch  later} tomato, oregano, cumin, allspice, onion, garlic and diced green  chiles. Mix well and cook over low heat until the meat is tender. About 1  hour. If necessary add more chicken broth or water. Mix the corn starch  with the reserved chicken broth and thicken the gravy to the consistency of  a light smooth gravy. Add the sliced green chiles and oyster mushrooms, mix  well but gently and cook just long enough to heat them through. Correct the  seasonings if needed and serve at once.
