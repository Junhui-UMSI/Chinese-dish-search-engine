Boiled potatoes, Whole wheat flour or graham, White flour, Raw potatoes, Baking Powder, Ham shank, Salt and pepper, 
This recipe comes from Helen Myhres Cookbook "farm Recipes and Food  Secrets" from the Norske Nook. The Norske Nook is the Midwests #1 Roadside  Cafe. If anyone ever travels close to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, this cafe is  probably the worlds best food! It is located in a tiny town called Osseo,  Wisconsin. It is on the interstate highway going to and from Minneapolis  and St. Paul, Minnesota.    1. Boil the shank until done (when the meat loosens from the bone). Remove  it from the liquid, and let cool. Save the liquid.    2. Remove the meat and some of the fatty part from the bone and put it  through a grinder with the potatoes. Add the flours, baking powder, and  salt and pepper, making sure theres enough flour to make a stiff dough.    3. Using your hands, roll into dumplings, drop into the ham liquid, and  cook at a slow boil until done (about 1 hour). Serve the dumplings with  butter on top.
