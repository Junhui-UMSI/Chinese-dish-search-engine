Randys Secret Sauce
Vinegar, Dark Brown Sugar, Tabasco, Cayenne pepper, FIVE ALIVE (citrus beverage, Ketchup, Apple Cider Vinegar, Coarsely ground Black Pepper, Cumin, WINE & PEPPER WORCESTERSHIRE, 
This is the third an final BBQ sauce that I use. I call it Randys Secret  Sauce. It is my own creation. I have been working on this sauce for several  years trying many variations. At this point Its real good with a fresh  Taste but I think it needs some fine tuning. Give it a try and let me know  if you have some suggested improvements.    Mix at room temperature and use as a finishing and dipping sauce    NOTES: The Five Alive product (if you have not tried it) is a mixture of  different fruits like orange lime,tangerine grapefruit & something else.  Pretty tasty The Wine & Pepper sauce is excellent and is found usually near  the regular Worc. sauce    Substations:    Five Alive SUB the juice of 1 Valencia Orange    Wine & Pepper SUB Worcestershire sauce    Variations: (one at the time):    :  add 1 Tablespoon Soy sauce  :  add 1 Teaspoon Lime  :  Increase Apple Cider Vinegar to 1/4 cup  :  add 1 Tablespoon Sherry  :  add a dash of Liquid Smoke    Posted to bbq-digest Digest V97 #016 by "Randy & JoAnne Dewberry"  <flog68@altamaha.net> on Feb 28, 1997.
