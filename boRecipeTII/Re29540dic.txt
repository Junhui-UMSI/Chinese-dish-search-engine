Continue beating for 1 to 2 minutes, gradually  adding flour, lemonade (or orange juice) concentrate and baking soda,  and scraping sides of bowl often, until well-blended.    3. Drop batter by rounded teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets. Bake in a  preheated 400-degree oven until edges of cookies are lightly browned,  about 8 to 14 minutes.    4. Remove cookies from baking sheet. Let cool completely on a wire  rack.    Make the Frosting:    Combine all frosting ingredients except the milk in a small mixing  bowl.
