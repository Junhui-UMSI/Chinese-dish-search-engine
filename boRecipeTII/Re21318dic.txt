Put the vegetable juice, coffee, bay leaves, beef base or broth, garlic,  cumin and chile powder into a large Dutch oven. Bring to a boil. Reduce  heat to a simmer. Stir in the cocoa. Continue to simmer. Brown the beef and  pork in a large, heavy skillet. Add the pieces of meat to the Dutch oven as  they are browned. Let the mixture continue to simmer. Crumble the ancho  chiles into the blender. Add enough of the onion and celery to fill the  blender loosely. Add only enough hot water to permit the blender to work  easily. Blend until the ingredients are chopped fine. Add to the mixture in  the Dutch oven. Repeat with the remaining onion and celery. Add the chopped  green chiles and whole red chiles. Stir to mix thoroughly. Continue to  simmer, stirring only enough to prevent sticking or burning. Add the bell  peppers and tomato to the mixture. Simmer for at least 30 minutes. Add  vegetable juice or beef stock or broth if the mixture starts to get too  thick. Adjust the "heat" of the mixture with cayenne, waiting several  minutes after each addition before rechecking the balance. Continue to cook  to taste. Stir in the cinnamon at that point. Let simmer for four or five  minutes. Remove the bay leaves and whole chiles. Serve hot. Posted to EAT-L  Digest  by Joel Ehrlich <Joel.Ehrlich@SALATA.COM> on Jul 5, 1997
