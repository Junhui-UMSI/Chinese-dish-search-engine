Brown sugar, Butter, Water, Baking soda, Yeast, Salt, Warm water, Sugar, Brown sugar, Bread flour, Honey, 
Mix yeast, brown sugar, dash of salt and 1 1/2 cups water.  Let sit for  five minutes.  Add bread flour.  Knead well.  Let rise for about one hour.   Take a piece of dough and roll and shape into a pretzel.  The easiest way  to shape is to roll into a rope, whatever size you prefer.  Pinch ends of  rope then bring ends of rope to other side of circle.  Mix baking soda and  warm water.  Melt butter and mix with honey. Dip pretzels in baking soda  and water mixture.  Bake at 550F for approximately 8 minutes. Sprinkle with  white and brown sugar.    Posted to Digest bread-bakers.v097.n054 by Peg Doolin  <pegsean@together.net> on Aug 24, 1997
