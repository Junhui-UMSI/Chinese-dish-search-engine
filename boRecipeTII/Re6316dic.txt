I made them this evening and my SO loved them.  I  deleted 1/2 cup toasted sunflower seeds from the recipe for the board. When  I made these I also reduced the amount of soy sauce to 2 or 3 tablespoons  and the amount of egg white or replacer, because they didnt seem to need  that much to keep them stuck together. You might just add enough of them  until the mixture starts sticking well together, like I did. I ended up  with 10 "burger-shaped" patties. I hope that you enjoy these as much as we  did!    Combine all ingredients, except bread and condiments, in a large bowl and  mix well.  Form into 8 rectangular patties.  "Fry" in a large nonstick  skillet over medium-high heat until thoroughly heated, about 4 minutes per  side. Serve on French bread with condiments.
