~--------------For the beef:---------------------------------------  ~--------------FOR THE DISH:---------------------------------------- PLACE  THE MEAT in the freezer for 30 minutes to facilitate slicing. Slice it  against the grain into very thin slices, less than 1/4-inch. Combine the  beef with the wine, vinegar, garlic, onion, thyme, marjoram, parsley, bay  leaf, salt and pepper in a glass or stainless steel bowl. Marinate at room  temperature for 20 minutes, or up to 4 hours refrigerated, tightly covered  with plastic wrap. Drain the beef. Reserve the marinade, and pat beef dry  on paper towels. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add  the beef and stir-fry for 1 minute. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon,  and reserve. Add the pepper, onion and celery to the wok, and stir-fry for  2 minutes. Add the reserved marinade, and cook over high heat until the  liquid is reduced by 2/3 and the vegetables are cooked but still crisp,  about 5 minutes. Return the beef to the pan, and heat for 1 minute. Serve  immediately. Serves 4.
