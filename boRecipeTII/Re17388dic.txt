Walnut Crescents
Egg yolks, Ground walnuts, Confectioners sugar, Flour, Sugar, Sweet butter, 
Legend has it that bakers started making pastry in the form of crescents  following the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683.     Preheat oven to 350?.     In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar and ground walnuts. Make a little well  in the flour mixture and add the egg yolks. Cut butter into small pieces  and add to the flour mixture. Knead thoroughly and shape into a ball. Add  flour, if needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl.     Cut the ball in 4 parts and shape each part in a roll about inch thick.  Cut 1/4-inch pieces and form small crescents in the palm of your hand.  Place crescents on a greased baking sheet and bake about 9-10 minutes,  until light brown.     While still warm, roll the crescents in the confectioners sugar (be  careful, they break very easily), then place them on a board to cool. Store  in a cookie tin. The flavor actually improves with time.    Yield: about 3 dozen. Franziska Mayer, Washington, DC       Randy Shearer
