Heres the recipe for the  bread and the sandwich: -he gives recipe for mixer and hand combination -  adapt as necessary!]    Softenyeast in warm water in large mixer bowl, add buttermilk, eggs, butter  sugar baking powder sale ant 2 1/2 c flour. Blend at low then beat at  medium for 2 minutes. Stir in remaining flour by hand and knead till smooth  [3-5 minutes]. Shpe into round loaves and place in greased large brioche  molds or 1 lob coffee cans. Cover and let rist until light, about 45  minutes. Bake at 350 until golden brown and done, about 45 minutes - remove  from oven and brush tops with butter.    SANDWICHES: Slice the bread thinly and cut into rounds using a cookie  cutter. Peel and thinly slice 6-8 small white onions and chop a large bunch  of parsley. Spread the brioche rounds with mayonaise, top half with an  onionslice and salt well.
