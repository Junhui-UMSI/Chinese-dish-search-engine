LAY 2 SLICES OF HAM on 1 side of the butterflied breast. Refold the breast,  enclosing the ham. Lay the breast on a sheet of caul fat. Roll up tight.  The caul is sticky, so it needs nothing to seal it. Dust the surface with  water chestnut powder, flour or cornstarch. Shake off the excess. Heat the  oil in a wok to 350F (moderate). Slide the chicken breasts into the oil, 1  by 1. When they have browned (about 5 minutes), remove 1 from the oil and  press it. If it feels mushy, it needs more cooking. Remove and drain the  chicken. Slice the chicken, crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.    VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a wok and flavor with garlic and ginger.  Remove the garlic and ginger and add the water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and  scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add soy sauce, wine or  sherry, and chicken broth. When the liquid boils, stir in the dissolved  cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread the sauce on a platter as a bed for  the sliced chicken breast.    KEN HOM - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
