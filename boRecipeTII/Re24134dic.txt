Recipe by: Los Angeles Times 4-30-97 Use medium-sized macaroni, not large  or salad-size. Macaroni gets floppy and limp when overcooked so begin  testing for tenderness at 5 minutes. Macaroni and cheese can taste flat, so  carefully taste for salt and add until dish tastes finished.Bring water to  boil and add salt to taste. Add macaroni and stir. Some macaroni will stick  to bottom of pot, so stir often first 5 minutes of cooking. Cook until  tender, about 7 minutes. Drain in colander and pour into 2-quart baking  dish. Add 3 tablespoons melted butter, sour cream, cheese and salt to  taste. Toss mixture until all ingredients are well integrated and cheese  has melted. Toss bread crumbs with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter  and sprinkle over top of macaroni.Bake at 350 degrees 15 minutes. Serve  hot. Formatted by Lynn Thomas.
