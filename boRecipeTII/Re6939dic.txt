Meanwhile cook the onions in 4 T. olive oil over moderate heat for 6 to 8  minutes until they are soft but not bown. Stir in the pepper and garlic and  cook, stirring, for 5 minutes more. Scrape the entire contents into a food  processor bowl..    Remove the skin from the eggplant. Add to the food processor. Pulse to  desired texture - can be coarse, smooth or anything in between, your call.  Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper & sugar.    Heat the remaining oil in the skillet and pour in the eggplant mixture.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then turn to low heat, cover and  simmer for about 1 hour. Remove the cover and cook an additional half hour,  stirring frequently, until all the moisture in the pan has evaporated and  the mixture is thick enough to hold its shape in a spoon. Stir in 2 T.  lemon juice and taste for seasoning. Transfer to a bowl and chill, covered  with plastic wrap, until ready to serve.    Spread on squares of pumpernickel bread or sesame crackers.    Serving Ideas : A terrific hors doeuvres    NOTES : The amount of olive oil can be reduced, but the texture  changes  -  it is still delicious. This also makes a delicious sandwich filling if  there is any left. This is time consuming, but doesnt need a lot of  attention, just an occasional stir.
