I made this recipe tonight from Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish. It  was absolutely wonderful!!! I feel compelled to share it.    Remove and discard tough kale ribs. Bring a large pot of salted water to  boil over high heat. Add kale leaves and boil 2 minutes. Drain in a  colander. Rinse with running cold water. Drain again well. Chop coarsely.  In a medium pot, combine broth, potaotes, onion, garlic, and bay leaf.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and adjust heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until  potatoes are just tender,about 10 minutes. Add beans and their liquid. Cook  covered over low heat, until potatoes are soft and flavors are well  blended, about 20 minutes.    Add chopped kale and simmer 5 minutes, uncovered. Season to taste with salt  and pepper. Remove bay leaf. Stir in lemon zest and serve.    Posted to fatfree digest by JBennicoff@aol.com on Feb 5, 1998
