Wash  and thoroughly dry the lettuce then place in a large salad bowl.  Chop the  chicken into bite sized pieces and mix with the tomatoes, pepper, spring  onions and bean sprouts. Add to the bowl. Mix together the dressing  ingredients. Pour over the salad, toss and serve.     237 Calories, 29 g protein, 6.4 g carbohydrates of which 4.9 g is sugar,  11 g fat of which 2.3 g is saturated, trace of sodium, 2.1 g dietary fibre.     NOTE: Recipe called for "2 lettuces"! If this is iceberg lettuce, the  amount seems way too much, I think. Maybe it should be "2 heads/bunches  leaf lettuce" or something like that??? --Glen    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MealMaster recipe list.
