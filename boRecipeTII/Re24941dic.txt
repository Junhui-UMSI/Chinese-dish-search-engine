Autumn Broccoli Salad
Lemon juice, Cherry tomatoes -- halved, Salt, Mustard, Pepper -- to taste, Minced green onion, Broccoli, olive oil, Garlic oil (see note) or, Grated Parmesan cheese, Red wine vinegar, 
1. In a small bowl whisk together mustard, vinegar, and lemon juice. Add  garlic oil gradually, whisking constantly. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the  Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and set aside for at least 1  hour or up to 1 day.    2. Trim broccoli and cut into florets (reserve stalks for soup, if  desired). Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat; add  florets and cook until tender-crisp. Drain and immediately plunge into ice  water. When cool, drain again and pat dry. Broccoli may be cooked up to 6  hours ahead, cooled, and stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator.    3. Transfer broccoli to a large bowl along with tomatoes. Add dressing to  vegetables and toss to coat well. Add green onion and remaining 1/4 cup  Parmesan and toss to blend. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer to a  serving platter.    Note: To make garlic oil, add 6 whole peeled garlic cloves to 1 pint extra  virgin olive oil. Marinate at least 1 week before using. Oil will keep  indefinitely if covered and refrigerated.    Variation: Cauliflower may be substituted for all or part of the broccoli.    Recipe By     : The California Culinary Academy    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
