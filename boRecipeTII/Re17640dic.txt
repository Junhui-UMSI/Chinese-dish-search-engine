Beat  egg whites until stiff but not dry then beat in the sugar gradually. Beat  until stiff and satiny. Fold the vanilla, chocolate, and almonds into the  egg whites. Drop by spoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350  degrees F. for 15 minutes. This will make 4 1/2 dozen - gauge the size of  the meringue accordingly so you know you are making them the correct size.
