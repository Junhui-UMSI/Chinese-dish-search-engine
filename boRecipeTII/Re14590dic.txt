"Kentucky Friend Chicken" Coleslaw
Mayonnaise, Lemon joice, White vinegar, Whole cabbage, Pepper, Salt, Carrot, Buttermilk, Sugar, milk, 
combine first 8 ingredients. mix well. add cabbage and carrot. chill 2  hours.  (for LF list) my friend made this and said it was GREAT. im sure you can  use reduced fat stuff, but it wont come out EXACTLY the same... play with  the sugar if you feel the need. enjoy!!!
