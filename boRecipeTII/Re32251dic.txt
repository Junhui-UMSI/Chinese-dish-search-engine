An All-American  Lowfat Feast by Lou Seibert Pappas    Wash the turkey inside and out and pat dry. Rub the entire surface as well  as the cavity with lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the  turkey breast side up on the grill of a barbecue over medium hot coals,  cover with a kettle lid, and barbecue until a meat thermometer registers  170 degrees F, about 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Transfer to a board. Let the turkey  rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Garnish the platter with a wreath  of rosemary and oregano.    Makes about 12 servings.
