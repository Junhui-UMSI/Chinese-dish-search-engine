Asparagus/tomato/pasta Salad
Parmesan cheese, Dijon mustard, Onion, Dried basil, Black pepper, Asparagus, Red wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic, Dried parsley, Cherry tomatoes, Salt, Pasta, 
Cook pasta according to instructions. Add asparagus for the last 2 1/2  minutes of boiling (not longer than this or it will be too soft). Drain and  rinse with cold water. Add tomatoes and onions. Chill. Combine the  remaining ingredients, and pour over salad when ready to serve. Add salt  and freshly ground black pepper to taste. [Sprinkle parmesan cheese on  top.]    Yumm! this served 10 at dinner with leftovers, (but it was not the main  dish). I can also imagine it with small cubes of mozzarella cheese instead  of (or in addtion to) parmesan, or with dill instead of basil.
