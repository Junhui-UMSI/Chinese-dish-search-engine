In a large stewpot, saute the onions and garlic in the olive oil until  translucent. Cut the eggplant into 1" cubes and add them to the pot. Slice  the pepper into 1"-square pieces. Crush the tomatoes. Add the peppers,  tomatoes, water, salt, and fennel to the pot. If using dried dill, add it  now. Cover the pot and simmer, stirring frequently, until the eggplant is  completely tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the fresh dill, if used, and  add the lemon juice and spinach. Simmer for another minute or two until the  spinach wilts but is still bright green. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Serve topped with feta cheese, if desired    NOTES : If you expect to have leftover stew, set some aside before adding  the spinach, because the spinach will lose its fresh color. Rewarm the  leftover stew, and stir in the spinach just before serving. Serve with a  hearty bread. **original recipe called for 1/2 cup feta cheese, which puts  this recipe over 30% CFF Per serving: 161.8 Cals., 5.9 g fat (29.7% CFF), 7  g fiber, 673 mg sodium    Recipe by: Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by Diana Slade <dianaslade@mindspring.com> on Nov  19, 1998,
