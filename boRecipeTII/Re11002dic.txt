Its from  Joan Nathans Cooking in America.    1. In a medium saucepan, heat oil and brown orzo until it is slightly  brown.    2. Wash the rice in a bowl with warm water, rubbing lightlyl.  Drain and  repeat twice more.    3. Bring the 3 1/2 cups of water to a boil.  Add the rice, orzo, and salt,  and let the water return to a boil, stirring thoroughly.    4. Cover the pan tightly and lower the heat. Simmer for 20 minutes or until  water is absorbed.  Fluff with a fork.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 253    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
