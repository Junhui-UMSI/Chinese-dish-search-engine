Lay out chicken parts in baking dish and bake in 350 degree oven for 40  min.  Cool them a bit and pour sauce (method below) over the chicken, cover  and marinate in refrigerator for at least an hour, or overnight would be  better. When ready to grill, drain excess sauce and reserve. Place chicken  on prepared grill, skin side up, about 8" from heat. Grill, turning a few  times, for about 20 min or until fork can be inserted with ease. Brush  generously with reserved sauce during 20 min of grilling. When chicken is  done, place on platter; top with remaining sauce and sprinkle with cheese,  if you like. Sauce: In small saucepan, make sauce by mixing together onion,  tomato sauce, taco sauce, molasses, vinegar, oil, salt, oregano, and  pepper.  Bring mixture to a boil.  Remove from heat and cool 2 min. FROM:  PAT MULDROW   (DCGM11B)
