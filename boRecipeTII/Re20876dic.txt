Apple Mousse
Tahini, Apple juice, Cinnamon; to garnish, Agar-agar flakes, 
And ... I dont have this book but it is apparently one of the bibles on  the macro subject: THE SELF-HEALING COOKBOOK, by Kristina Turner, 1987  Earthtones Press.    Serves 4 to 6: Bring juice and agar to a boil and simmer until agar  dissolves. Pour into a shallow glass dish and refrigerate until sent.  Blend/whip with tahini and spoon into individual parfait glasses. Garnish  with dusting of cinnamon.    SOURCE: DIET FOR ALL SEASONS, by Elson M. Haas (Paperback - ISBN 0890877327  ~ Celestial Arts - 1995). He does not mention that this particular recipe  comes from the Turner book but the Turner book is in the "recommended  reading" list.
