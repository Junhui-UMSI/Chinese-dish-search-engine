1. In a heavy-bottom pot, saute the leeks in butter over medium heat until  they are soft but not brown, 6 to 7 minutes.      2. Add the stock, potatoes, salt, and thyme. Cover and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes can be easily pierced with a  fork, about 15 minutes.      3. Add the asparagus and pepper and simmer uncovered until the asparagus  are cooked, about 10 minutes.      4. Transfer half the solids to a blender or food processor. Add the  half-and-half and puree until smooth. Return this mixture to the pot and  bring to a simmer over low heat. Serve hot, garnished with parsley.      Notes: This soup can be refrigerated for 2 days. Reheat gently before  serving.      Chowder is also very good made with chicken stock.      Serves 6 as a first course, 4 as a light entree      Preparation time: 20 to 30 minutes    Cooking time: 30 to 35 minutes      Recipe by Karen Lee and Diane Porter,The Occasional Vegetarian      MC formatted by Brenda Adams ~~ltadamsfmle~~at;sprintmail.com>; mc 6/3/97      NOTES : Tastes rich, but it has only a fraction of the fat of most  chowders.
