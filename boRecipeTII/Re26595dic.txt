Place yeast in a warm bowl and add the water, stirring to dissolve. Add  malted milk powder and sugar and stir until dissolved.  Add salt and flour  all at once. Work the dough with fingers and hands, kneading into a stiff  dough. Or use a mixer equipped with a dough hook.    2.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth.  Shape the dough into a ball and place it in an ungreased bowl.  Cover with  plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk.    3.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.    4.  Bring the ingredients for the water bath to a boil.    5.  Punch the dough down and divide into 16 equal portions.  Roll each  portion into a ball. Pierce the center of each ball with thumb and index  finger. Using fingers, shape each ball into a ring like a doughnut.    6.  If the water bath is boiling, turn off the heat.  When the bagels are  dropped into it, the water should be just below the boiling point.    7.  Drop the bagel rounds into the just-under-boiling water and let them  cook for about 20 seconds on each side. Remove the rounds from the water  using a slotted spoon.    8.  Place the bagel rounds on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 15-17  minutes or until lightly browned. Eat fresh or store in freezer.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
