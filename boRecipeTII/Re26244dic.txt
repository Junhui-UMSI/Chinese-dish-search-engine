Tomatillo Soup
Onion, Vegetable oil spray, Nonfat sour cream, Tomatillos, Orzo, Chicken bouillon, Garlic, Jalapeno, 
Lightly spray a nonstick 4-quart Dutch oven with vegetable oil and place  over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, a few teaspoons water, and cook,  stirring constantly, about 5 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add 3  cups water, tomatillos, jalapeno, and bouillon cube and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly.    Transfer the mixture to a food processor, or use an immersion, or hand,  blender, and puree until smooth. Return the mixture to the Dutch oven, stir  in the orzo, and heat through, but dont boil. Either stir in the sour  cream in the pot or add a dollop on each serving.

The       tomatillo is smaller than a tomato, covered with a tight-fitting       paperlike husk, and tastes best when green. It can be found in       specialty food stores, Latin American markets, and some       supermarkets. Substitute green tomatoes if you cant find       tomatillos. Orzo is a small rice- shaped pasta that cooks in just       a few minutes. (250 cal, 1.5g fat)
