Because of the richness of the  avocado, we can use milk instead of cream without compromising the texture.    1. Steam or boil the potatoes until soft and let cool. Meanwhile, roast,  peel, and seed the poblanos. Roast the tomatillos and onions until lightly  charred.    2. Combine the roasted vegetables and potatoes in a food processor or  blender and puree. Add the serrano chile, cilantro, mint, lime juice,  ginger, and avocado and puree until smooth, adding milk as necessary to  facilitate the blending. Transfer to a bowl or storage container and thin  to the desired texture with milk. Add salt and pepper to taste. Chill.    3. Taste the chilled soup for seasoning and correct if necessary. Mix the  sour cream and chipotle chile together and drizzle over each bowl soup as a  garnish.    Note:   Normally this soup is served cold, but it can be reheated gently  and served warm. If you prefer it less spicy, leave out the chipotle  garnish and simply garnish with a sprig cilantro. Typos by Brenda Adams    EAT-L Digest 18 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
