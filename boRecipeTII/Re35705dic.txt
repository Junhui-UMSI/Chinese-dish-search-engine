Stuffed Cabbage
Cloved of garlic -- thinly, Cooks wild rice*, Diced onion, 
*(I used a mixture, actaully, of black japonica, brown and a long grain  white)    In apple cider, saute onion and garlic until onion is soft. Add rice,  raisins and some more cider. Heat gently for a few minutes to let flavors  meld.    Take cabbage and core and plunge into hot water for a few (5?) minutes to  loosen leaves. Peel off a dozen or so leaves.    Put a layer of sauce in the bottom of the pan. Roll the cabbage leaves  around the rice mixture by putting a tablespoon or so of the mixture i the  middle of the cabbage leaf, fold up the sides and roll. Put the rolled  cabbage on the sauce; layer as needed by putting sauce on top of the  cabbage, adding more rolls, end with sauce. Cover and bake 30 minutes in a      350    degree oven.    I made this the other night -- adapting a recipe I found a while back in  Vegetarian Times. It was yummy! Served with an acorn squash and some sliced  fresh vegetables. And, it was good the next day for lunch, too.
