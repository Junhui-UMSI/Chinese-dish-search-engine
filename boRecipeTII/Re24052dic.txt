Pate de foie gras, Whole mushroom caps, Beef tenderloin steaks, Toast -- buttered, Red wine, Sherry, Whole truffles -- sliced, Beef bouillon, 
Cook steaks in butter to your own taste, and remove to a warmed platter. In  the same butter, saute mushroom caps gently for 5 minutes. Prepare 4 slices  of buttered toast (crusts removed).    Add 4 neat slices of pate de foie gras and 1 minced truffle to the meat  pan, and heat very gently. Place the foie gras on the toast, and top with  steak and a bit of minced truffle. Keep warm.    Deglaze the pan by adding the bouillon and sherry, and scraping down all  the good brown bits of meat from the sides of the pan. Blend it all as  smoothly as possible, add mushrooms, and pour over the beef.    Recipe By     : Elizabeth Powell    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
