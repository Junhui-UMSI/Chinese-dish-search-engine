Plain Rice Pilaf - Armenian (Printz Pilaf)
Chicken Broth (Stock), Onion, Paprika, Parsley; finely chopped, OPTIONAL GARNISHES, Butter, Salt to taste, Garlic, Basmati Rice (uncooked), OPTIONAL ADDITIONS, 
In a heavy saucepan or casserole, melt the butter over moderate heat. Add  the rice and cook 2 minutes until grains are thoroughly coated with butter  but not browned, stirring constantly. Pour in the broth (stock), sprinkle  with salt and bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and  simmer for about 20 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed and  the rice is tender, but still firm to the bite - not mushy. Gently fluff  the rice with a fork. Spoon onto a heated serving platter being careful not  to mash it.    NOTE. You may simmer the rice 15 minutes or until just tender, then stir  gently with a fork and place uncovered in a preheated 325 F oven 30 minutes  or until the grains are dry and separate. Fluff gently with a fork every 10  minutes.    Although it is not typical, the pilaf may be flavoured with onion or  garlic -as shown in the optional extras. The onion would be fried in the  butter before adding the rice, or the crushed garlic added to the fried  rice, before the addition of the broth. The pilaf may also be sprinkled  with finely chopped parsley or paprika just before serving.
