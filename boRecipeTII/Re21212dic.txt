U-238 Punch
Fresh strawberries, Orange wedges, Pineapple chunks, Vodka, Pineapple juice, Strawberry juice, Orange juice, Rum, 
Mix all ingredients well. Chill. Serve as you would punch.     This beverages motto is: Hiroshimas favorite since 45. Guaranteed to  bomb you into the next decade!     NOTE: Orange juice and wedges and pineapple juice and chunks can be  substituted for your favorite fruit. However, the strawberries and juice is  considered MANDATORY! The vodka can also be substituted for your favorite  booze, but rum is MANDATORY!     The general rule of thumb for this recipe is: two quarts of booze (one of  which MUST be rum), and three quarts of fruit juice including 1 pint of  accompanying FRESH fruit (one of the fruits MUST be strawberries)    Personal Note: I "discovered" this one at the 1979 Milwaukee Summerfest.  Two fellow audience members were passing this stuff around in a plastic  milk jug several hours before Seals & Crofts were to go on. How come this  stuff didnt eat through the jug is beyond me, but the drink (more of a  "punch") is very tasty. I thank those two intrepid people for this recipe.  ~ Michael P. Orchekowski.
