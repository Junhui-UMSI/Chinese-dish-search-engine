For chili: The recipe recommends soaking the beans overnight. Personally,  I dont like to do that. I find the quick soak method works better. That  is, cover beans with cold water. Bring to a boil and boil for 1-2 min. Turn  off heat and let soak for 1 1/2 hours. Drain beans. Heat vegetable oil in a  large heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped onion and saute 5  minutes.  Add diced chilies, minced garlic, oregano, cumin, and chili  powder. Saute for 5 minutes. Add beans, chicken broth, chopped tomatillos  and cilantro. Its important that the chicken broth contain little or no  salt. Salt inhibits the softening of the seed coat of beans. Therefore, if  you add salt too early the beans with never soften up. Add turkey breast  and simmer until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Transfer turkey to  plate. Cover with foil and refrigerate. Simmer chili until beans are  tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Cut turkey into 1/2 inch pieces. Add turkey,  green onions and lime juice to chili. Stir. Heat through. Season with salt  and pepper.    For cilantro cream: Combine yogurt, parsley, chopped cilantro in a medium  bowl.  Ladle chili into bowls. Top with spoonful of cilantro cream.  Sprinkle with cilantro sprigs and cheese. Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover chili and cilantro cream separately and refrigerate. Before serving,  reheat chili over low heat. Like most chili, it tastes better the second  day.
