Violet Souffle
Granulated sugar, Violet essence, Butter, Candied violets, Egg whites, Salt, Granulated sugar, Egg yolks, 
Beat sugar and yolks together until pale and thick. Add violet essence and  candied violets. Whip egg whites with salt to stiff peaks. Fold together.    Butter the inside of a large souffle dish and coat with as much sugar as  will stick to the butter. Pour souffle mixture in. Bake 15 minutes at 400.  Sprinkle confectioners sugar over the top and return to oven for 5 more  minutes. Serve hot.    You may substitute 1/3 c of liquor (rum or bourbon, for example) or up to  1/2 c of liqueur (orange or apricot brandy or Grand Marnier, for example)  for the violet essence and candied violets. In most of these cases you  might want to add 1/2 t or so of vanilla as well.
