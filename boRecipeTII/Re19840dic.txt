Apple and Celery Soup
Salt and milled pepper, fresh celery, parsley, Butter, Milk, apples, cooking, Vegetable stock, Onions, brown sugar, 
In a large saucepan sweat off the diced onion in the butter. Wash, trim and  dice the celery, add to the onion and continue on a low heat. Remove and  bruises from the apples and grate them into your pan, discarding the core.  Cook for a further 10 minutes before adding the stock, seasoning and sugar  ~ beware too much salt if you are using a stock cube. Bring to the boil,  then simmer, lid on, for 30 minutes - dont over cook or the celery flavour  becomes jaded and the colours dull. Allow to cool a little before  liquidising thoroughly. Pass through a large mesh sieve to ensure there are  no stringy threads of celery remaining. Check seasoning and consistency,  adding a little milk if needed. Serve in warmed bowls, sprinkled with  parsley and the browned almond flakes.    Source: Lakeland Plastics
