SERVES 10      Boston has so many truly fine seafood restaurants that trying to decide  where to go for dinner is frustrating. Turners offers good food and fine  chowder and claims to have won several Boston contests with this recipe. It  is very basic Boston chowder. Bostonians dont want you messing around with  good basic chowder. I have adapted the recipe to use regular clams .      Clams on the West Coast have a bit stronger flavor than those in the  East. While I prefer the western clam, some of my eastern friends say that  my favorite is too strong for them. You can adjust this recipe to your  liking.      Wash clams and steam in a 12-quart heavy stockpot. Reserve the broth.  Remove the clams from their shells and chop coarsely. Cover both items and  set aside.      In the same pot saute the garlic in the butter for about 3 minutes. Add  the onion, celery, pepper, bay leaf, and thyme. saute until the onions are  clear. Add the flour to make a roux, stirring constantly. Cook over low  heat for 5 minutes (dont brown). Slowly add the clam nectar, stirring  constantly to avoid lumps. Simmer for 10 minutes (the soup will be thick at  this point so be careful that it does not burn). Add the potato and cook  until tender. Add the cream and clams and bring back to a boil. Correct the  seasoning.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
