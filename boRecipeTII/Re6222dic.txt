Pizza W/ Salmon and Caviar
-(up to), Dry active yeast, Smoked salmon; thin, All-purpose flour, Sour cream, olive oil, Golden caviar, Bunch chives; finely chopped, Sugar, Salt, 
Activate the yeast by sprinkling it over 1/4 C. warm water. Let stand 5  min. Dissolve the sugar & salt in 1 C. warm water. Sift the flour into a  large bowl. Add the sugar/water mixture & mix the dough w/ your fingers for  1 min. Add the dissolved yeast & knead the dough about 10 min. or until it  is smooth and elastic and no longer sticks to fingers or bowl. Cover w/a  warm, damp cloth and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hr., or until doubled in  bulk. Preheat oven to 450 F. Punch down the risen dough. Remove from bowl  and divide into 2 equal portions. Flatten one portion with your palm, then  stretch and turn with your fingers to form a circle. Place the stretched  dough on a lightly floured surface and roll out to a 12 in. circle using a  rolling pin. Turn the dough clockwise after each roll. Repeat with second  portion. Form a rim around the edge of each pizza & place on lightly  floured baking sheets. Brush the dough w/olive oil. Bake on lower rack of  oven until golden brown, about 10 min. When baked, remove pizzas from oven,  cool slightly & spread the sour cream generously over each. Place 1 tbs.  caviar in center of each pizza, surround w/salmon slices, and sprinkle  salmon w/chives. Serve immediately, cut into wedges. Note: Use oven bricks  when baking to obtain crispier dough. If you wish, divide dough into 4  portions for 9-in. pizzas.    SPAGO    W. SUNSET BLVD.; LOS ANGELES    WINE: VILLA MT.
