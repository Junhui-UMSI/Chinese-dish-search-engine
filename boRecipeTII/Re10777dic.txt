From: christi@meaddata.com (Christi Wilson)    Date: 12 Jan 1994 23:31:22 GMT    Good Housekeeping, October 1992. About 3.5 hours before serving or day  ahead:    1. In large bowl, combine cornmeal, salt, yeast, and 1 cup flour.  In  1-quart saucepan over low heat, heat molasses, margarine or butter, and 1  cup water until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). Margarine or  butter does not need to melt completely. Meanwhile, grease a 2-quart  souffle dish or casserole.    2. With mixer at low speed, gradually beat molasses mixture into dry  ingredients just until blended. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes,  occasionally scraping bowl with rubber spatula. Beat in egg and 1 cup flour  to make a thick batter; continue beating 2 minutes, scraping bowl often.  With wooden spoon, stir in remaining 1 cup flour to make a soft dough.    3. Place dough in souffle dish. Cover and let rise in warm place (80-85  degrees F) until doubled, about 1 hour.    4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Bake bread 30-35 minutes until browned  and loaf tests done. Remove loaf from souffle dish. Cool bread on wire  rack. Makes 1 round loaf, about 10 servings.
