Water, Stock, rice, Eggs, juice of 1 lemon, salt and pepper, 
Prepare a stock by boiling slowly lean lamb, meat bones, or chicken with  enough water to cover.  Strain stock when meat is done.  1/2 hour before  serving, boil stock and add rice or orzo.  When orzo is done, reduce heat  to simmer. In a bowl, beat eggs with 2 Tbsp. water and the lemon juice.  Spoon broth into egg mixture STIRRING CONSTANTLY to prevent curdling. After  adding about 5 Tbsp. broth to eggs, add eggs to the broth on the stove  STIRRING CONSTANTLY. Remove from heat. It should be slightly thick. Serve  immediately.  I like this pretty "lemony", so I sometimes add more lemon.  From archives of rec.food.recipes    Date: Tue, 31 Jan 1995 08:20:10 GMT    From: trev@wg.icl.co.uk (Trevor Hall)
