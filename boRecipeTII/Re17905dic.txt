Alsatian Gratin of Roots (Lacto)
Onions finely chopped, Minced fresh parsley, (2 medium) rutabagas, Broth chicken, beef, or, Potatoes (about 6large), Carrots (1 lb) chopped, Nutmeg to taste, Vegetable, Jarlsberg cheese (I used ff, Cheese instead), 
In a 5-6 quart pan (I used a small roaster) cook onions and carrots in 1/2  cup of broth until softened.  Add to this the parsley.    Peel and thinly slice the potatoes and rutabagas.  Arrange half of the  potato/rutabaga combo in the bottom of the pan (I sprayed with Pam first).  Top with half the onion/carrot mixture. Repeat with the other half of the  ingredients.  Over the top, pour the rest of the broth.    Cover and bake for 1 1/2 hours in a 425 degree oven.  Top with cheese and  sprinkle with nutmeg.  Broil until cheese is browned.    Makes 10-12 servings    Comment: I wanted to share a recipe which I have been making this winter  for my family.  It is a good cold weather dish. It makes enough for a crowd  ~ my family (2 adults and 3 teens) only eat about half. This can be made  ahead and chilled until ready to use.    Source: Sunset Magazine.
