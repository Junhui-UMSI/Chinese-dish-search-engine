Add onion and cook over low  heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened. Add rice and toss to coat with  butter. Stir in 3 cups water and the salt. Bring to a simmer, cover  tightly, and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 45 to 50  minutes, or until rice is tender and all water is absorbed.If water is  absorbed before rice is tender, add a few tablespoons more and continue  cooking. Melt the remaining tbsp butter in a medium skillet. Add green and  purple grapes and toss in the butter until heated through. Add grape  mixture and parsley to the cooked wild rice, season with pepper, and toss  to mix thoroughly. Add additional salt if necessary. Serve hot.
