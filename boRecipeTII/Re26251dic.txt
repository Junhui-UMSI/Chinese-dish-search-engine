Tomatillo-Cucumber Salsa
Red wine, Cucumber; peeled, Lime; juice of, Ripe Jalapenos, Red bell pepper, salt and pepper, Garlic, Tomatillos; peeled, rinsed,, Corncob; corn from, Jabaneros; gutted, Bunch cilantro, White onion, 
Mix all this stuff in a blender or cuisinart-type device (except corn, add  that at the end).    As it turned out, the cucumber made it taste sort of like gazpacho to me,  but this opinion was not universal.    I thought the heat was sort of sneaky and subtle but one person put it in  her mouth and said, "WOW, ITS HOT!" so what do I know?    To prepare the tomatillos, remove the green outer peel and rinse under  water, then dump into boiling water until the color changes.    To prepare the corn, I recommend cooking the corncob and using a knife to  remove only the first row of kernels.  After that, use your fingers to bend  each row torwards the open space until the kernels pop off.  Its easier  than it sounds and results in kernels that remain uncut.
