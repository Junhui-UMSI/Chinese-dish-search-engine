Apple Potpourri
Cinnamon; (2") sticks, Whole allspice berries, Cloves, Cinnamon oil, Canella or nandina berries, Ground cinnamon, Pinecones, Dried apple slices, 
Combine all ingredients and place in a tight jar or tin. Shake every few  days. Cinnamon oil has an extremely strong scent that intensifies as it is  absorbed. Add additional oil if needed.    The red sumac berries that grow wild can be used dried as a stablizer for  potpourri (in other recipes it takes the place of orris root which is very  expensive). I used sumac berries instead of nandina berries in this recipe.    busted by sooz    Recipe by: Key Gourmet    Posted to recipelu-digest by sooz <kirkland@gj.net> on Mar 20, 1998
