Potato Soup with Worst and Garden Herbs
Potatoes, Takjes parsley, finely, Beef bouillon tablet; (or, Water, Sparkling white wine, Freshly ground pepper; to, Gekookte worst **, Takjes selderij***, finely, 
* A Dutch bouillon tablet is good for 1/2 liter (about 2 cups) water; an  American cube is good for 1 cup water.    ** "Gekookte worst" is a worst, 2-3" in diameter. When we get a craving for  a bologna sandwich, this is what we use. It doesnt really look like  bologna - its smaller around and a bit coarser in texture, but the taste  is similar. I think you could substitute some good-quality bologna.    *** Cant think of the English word for "selderij". It looks like flat  parsley; tastes a bit of celery. Just use more parsley if you cant find  anything similar.    Peel, wash, then dice the potatoes. Put the pots in a pan with the water,  bouillon tablet, and wine. Bring to a boil; put a lid on, turn down the  heat, and simmer for 20 min, till the pots are done. Let cool for a bit.  Puree the pots and cooking liquid; return to pan. [This is a good point to  put it in the frig, if youre making ahead.] [I thought it was a bit  gelatinous, as potato soups are wont to be, at this point, so I added  another cup of water (that I whizzed in the blender to clean it out.]    Remove the skin from the worst. Cut the worst into "matchsticks" up to 2"  long. Finely chop the parsley and selderij.    Warm the soup broth. Stir in the worst and herbs and heat till warmed  through.    Serves 2 as main course, or 4-6 as starter.
