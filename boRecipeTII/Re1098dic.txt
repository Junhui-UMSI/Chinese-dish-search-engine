Cornpone
All Purpose Unbleached White, Yellow cornmeal, Baking Powder, Salt, Sugar; (up to 4), Buttermilk, Whole Milk, Eggs, Butter or Margarine, 
Preheat oven to 425. Using about 2-3 T. of shortening, grease a 9" inch  cast iron skillet. Place the skillet in the preheated oven. In a large  mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredents together. Blend well. In a  smaller bowl add buttermilk, milk, and eggs. Add the melted margarine and  mix well. Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredents and mix well. Remove  the hot skillet from the oven and carefully pour in the batter. Return the  skillet to the oven, remembering that the skillet is still hot. Bake for 25  minutes. Remove to a plate and rub top with a stick of butter or margarine.    TIPS Have all ingredents at room temperature. Stone ground yellow corn meal  works best and gives a golden color bread. Dont use no-fat margarines.  They contain too much water. Mix the batter till smooth. I dont care what  your Grandmother said about lumpy batter being OK. Use a seasoned cast iron  skillet. You may also use a cast iron muffin pan without the paper cups. If  you use any other type muffin pan the paper cups may be necessary. Spray  the paper cups with PAM. Make sure the greased skillet is in the oven long  enough to get hot. This will make for a crispy crust.    Posted to bbq-digest by "James A. Whitten" <bigjim@atlantic.net> on Aug 17,  1998,
