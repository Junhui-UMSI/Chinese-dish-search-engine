Meanwhile, saute onion in oil until tender.  Add  remaining ingredients; simmer 15 minutes.  Drain ribs.  Place on rack in  broiler pan or over ash-colored coals on outdoor grill so meat is 6 to 7  inches from heat.  Broil 10 minutes, turning occasionally.  Baste ribs  with sauce; continue broiling about 10 minutes, turning and basting  frequently with sauce.  Serve with remaining sauce, if desired.
