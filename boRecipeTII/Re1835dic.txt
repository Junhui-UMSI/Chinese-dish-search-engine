Chicken Sofrito
Chicken, Sunflower oil, Juice of 1/2 lemon, Tumeric, Salt & white pepper, Cardamon, 
"Sophrito" is a method of cooking in Sephardi communities that employs slow  cooking in a mixture of oil and very little water - adding water gradually  as the sauce becomes reduced - which results in a taste & feel quite  different than that of a stew. You may choose to add some fried diced  potatoes - or boiled new potatoes - at the end if you wish.    In a large pot or casserole put oil, lemon juice & c. water, tumeric, salt,  pepper, cardamon & bring to a boil. Add the chicken. Cover & cook over very  low heat, turning chicken frequently & adding more water more water if  necessary until the chicken is very tender. There should be a good amount  of the sauce. Serve with plain rice.    Variation: add 2 cloves crushed garlic and INSTEAD of the tumeric &  cardamon add 1/2 ts. ground ginger & 1/2 ts. saffron powder    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Leatrice Spevack <leatrice@interlog.com> on  Nov 1, 1998,
