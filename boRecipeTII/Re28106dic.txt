Recipes by Jacqueline Higuera McMahan    These simple corn cakes are the perfect accompaniment to grilled meats or  poultry, or to a bowl of fiery chili. The texture is grainier than  cornbread and the flavor is reminiscent of tamales made with fresh corn.  Theyre irresistible!    INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch square  baking pan. Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Gradually  beat in the masa harina, water and cornmeal to make a thick batter. Blend  in the grated corn and sugar. Gently blend in the baking powder, salt and  cream.    Pour into the prepared pan, cover tightly with foil, and bake for 35  minutes, or until the cake is firm.    Cut into squares and serve hot or warm.    Serves 8.
