Basic Lebanese Aoili (Garlic Dressing)
Dijon mustard, Salt, Cayenne pepper, Wine vinegar, pepper, olive oil, roasted garlic, Unsalted chicken broth, fresh garlic, 
basic Lebanese aoili (garlic dressing) doesnt use egg for its base but  will still achieve the "mayo" consistancy - needless to say, for lo-fat use  less oil or substitute with one of the "better" oils - the original recipe  given to me called for putting the raw garlic in a blender & pureeing it  until you had a smooth paste, then a little lemon juice & pepper, then  slowly add oil (while the blenders running) - this will result in a  consistency    so we can take your basic recipe :    1 head roasted garlic - add some fresh garlic cloves for more flavor    blend till garlic is smooth paste    then add 1 tsp Dijon mustard,      1/2    tsp salt,      1/8    tsp cayenne pepper, fresh ground pepper to tste.    turn blender on & add 2 TBS olive oil,      1/4    cup unsalted chicken broth, 1/4 cup wine vinegar - try balsamic  vinegar instead for more flavor & zest.  Let sit for and hour or so and serve at roon temperature.    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n194 by "Rund, Sharen"  <RUNDSAB@alisa1.lockheed.com> on Aug 01, 1997
