Green Salsa
Green tomatos, Read onion; finely chopped, Fresh green chiles; seeded, Chopped fresh coriander, olive oil, White vinegar, Salt, 
Just mix em all together and serve in 30 minutes I didnt have any fresh  coriander, so I used ground up seed.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by John Moody <ai816@chebucto.ns.ca> on 4 No,  v 1998,
