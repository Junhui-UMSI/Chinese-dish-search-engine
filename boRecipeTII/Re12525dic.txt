from The Yemenite Cookbook by Zion Levi and Hani Agabria    Combine ground beef with flour, 1 tbsp oil, salt, pepper and zhoug. Form  the meat mixture into a 10-inch loaf. Make a well the entire length of the  loaf.    Heat 3 tbsp of oil in a skillet. Saute together the onions, mushrooms and  parsley until the onions are golden. Place the mixture in the well of the  loaf. Lightly beat the eggs and pour over the vegetables.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Pat the sides of the loaf together to close up the well, and wrap in  aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. The loaf may be served either hot or  cold.    *Zhoug is a source of pride among the Yemenite population. Made with the  sharpest of chili peppers, it is eaten with classically oriental Jewish  meals. More than just a condiment, it is a tradition. Yemenites believe  that daily consumption of zhoug wards off disease and strengthens the  heart. It can be an addition to salad, and a sauce for various kinds of  meat, fish and poultry dishes.    Zhoug: In a blender, puree enough chili peppers to measure 1 cup. Puree  parsley and coriander together and blend well with the chili peppers. Add  garlic, seasonings and olive oil. Again, blend well. Put the zhoug in a jar  and keep it in the refrigerator. It will remain fresh for many months.
