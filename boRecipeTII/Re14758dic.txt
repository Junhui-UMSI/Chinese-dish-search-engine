The traditional French dish takes days to prepare and contains a generous  portion of high-fat meats. By using sausage only, preparation time, fat and  calories are all cut down without sacrificing flavour.    In large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat; cook sausage, onions,  garlic,  carrots, celery, thyme, pepper and cloves, stirring, for about 5  minutes or until onions are softened. Add tomatoes, breaking up with fork.  Add chicken stock and bay leaf; bring to boil. Add beans; reduce heat and  simmer  for about 30 minutes or until slightly thickened. Discard bay leaf.    [Can be prepared to this point, cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to  1 day. Or freeze for up to 1 week; thaw in refrigerator for up to 36 hours.  Add 45 minutes to 1 hour to baking time.]    Topping: In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic; cook for  about 2 minutes or until softened. Stir in bread crumbs and chopped  parsley; sprinkle over cassoulet. Bake in 350F 180C oven for about 30  minutes or until crusty and golden on top, bubbly and heated through.    6 servings for $13.20CDN [Nov 95]    Per Serving: about 440 calories, 20 g protein, 18 g fat, 51 g carbohydrate,  very high source fibre, excellent source iron    Source: Canadian Living magazine, Nov 95 Presented in article "Hearty &  Healthy: Casseroles See The Light" Recipe by Canadian Living Test Kitchen        [-=PAM=-]   PA_Meadows@msn.com  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #342    From: "Paul A Meadows" <PA_Meadows@msn.com>    Date: Sat, 14 Dec 96 21:52:40 UT
