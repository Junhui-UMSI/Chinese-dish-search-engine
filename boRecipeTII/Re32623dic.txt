Sweet Onions with Asparagus Spears (Shaw)
Green onion; white part, Fresh orange juice, Vidalia onions; OR other, Chopped fresh basil, Slender asparagus; trimmed, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, bring enough water to cover the  onions to a boil. Add the onions and boil until theyre soft but still  retain their shape, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool. Bring  another pot of water to boil over medium-high heat and blanch the asparagus  in boiling water, for about 30 seconds, then drain and dunk in cold water  to stop the cooking. Set aside.    In a mixing bowl, combine olive oil orange juice, basil, and green onion.  Heat your grill or broiler.    Using a sharp paring knife, slice the outer layer off one of the onions in  one piece, cutting from top to bottom, so that you can unravel it. Place  the layer horizontally on your work surface. (The ends may curl toward the  center, hold them flat while you proceed.) Place 3 or 4 asparagus spears on  top, vertically, and roll up the onion layer so that it holds them snugly  in the center with the tips and the stems sticking out on either end. When  you reach the smaller layers, start cutting from another onion. Continue  stripping away layers of the onions and wrapping asparagus until youve  used up one or the other.    Brush each asparagus roll with the olive oil mixture. Grill over hot coats  or cook under the broiler, turning after 3 to 4 minutes, until the onions  have browned, about 6 to 8 minutes in all. 4 servings.    >Recipe from THE ESSENTIAL VEGETARIAN COOKBOOK, by Diana Shaw (Potter).  >Distributed by The Riverside Press-Enterprise, Food for 18-mar-98. >Edited  by Pat Hanneman (Kitpath) MC Serving: 165 cals, 14g fat 72%cff.
