Make a well in the center of the flour and put into it the next four  ingredients.  Quickly work these ingredients into the flour to make a  smooth dough, adding a bit more flour if needed, to facilitate handling. On  a floured board, roll out the dough into a 11X17" rectangle. Line a baking  sheet with the dough and bake it in a moderate oven (350 degrees F>), for  about 15 minutes, or until it is about half done.   Let it cool. Add the 4 egg yolks and lemon rind to the cottage cheese.  Beat the egg whites until very stiff, gradually adding the sugar, beginning  when they have slightly stiffened. Fold the beaten egg whites into the  cheese and spread the cooled pastry shell with the cheese filling. Sprinkle  the cake with the raisins and almonds. Bake in a very slow oven (250  degrees F.) about 45 minutes. Let cool and cut into large squares.  Gourmets Old Vienna Cookbook
