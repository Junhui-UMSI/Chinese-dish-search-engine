Eggs, Butter, Sugar, Warm water, Salt, All-Purpose Flour; Sifted, Active dry yeast, Cool water, 
Soften the yeast in warm water and stir in the sugar and salt to dissolve.  In a bowl, beat 2 of the eggs and blend in the flour. Then stir in the  yeast mixture and melted butter. Knead vigorously in the bowl with the  hands, till the dough leaves the sides of the bowl and is elastic -- about  5 min.  Make into a ball, put in a buttered bowl, and cover with plastic  wrap.  Let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 1/2 hours, or till  doubled in bulk. Punch down and divide into 18 equal pieces. Roll the  pieces into balls and arrange, well separated, on a buttered baking sheet.  Let rise 30 min till doubled in size. Brush with remaining egg beaten with  a tsp of water. Bake in a preheated oven at 375~ for 10 min or until nicely  browned.  Cool on a rack.
