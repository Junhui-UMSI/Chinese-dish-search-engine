Sweet-And-Sour Duck Sauce
Firm, ripe red plums*, Rice wine or cider vinegar, pitted, in 1/2" chunks, Sugar, Peeled, crushed garlic, Ground coriander, Onions; peeled, Dried crushed red pepper, Ground allspice, finely chopped**, 
*Should yield about 2 quarts.  **Should yield about 1 cup.    Place all ingredients except the sugar in a wide 4-quart saucepan and bring  to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil steadily for about 30  minutes.    Remove from heat, put through food mill, and return pureed fruit to pan.  Add sugar, place over medium heat, and stir constantly until mixture again  boils. Boil steadily about 30 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking;  continue boiling about 15 minutes more, stirring constantly. Sauce is done  when about 1/2 tsp. of it holds its shape on a chilled saucer. Spoon at  once into hot, sterilized half-pint jars and seal. Store at least a week to  mellow.    Yield: About 5 1/2 cups.    Lesem writes that her version is "...a fine dipping sauce not just for  roast duck, but also barbecued spareribs. I also like to mix it with oil  and vinegar to glaze spareribs or duckling during the last 20 to 30 minutes  of roasting or grilling."
