Peaches and Cream Soup
Peaches, nutmeg, Amaretto liqueur, Lemon juice, Half-and-half, 
This soup is a good use for overripe or damaged peaches. For a winter  treat, make it with canned peaches.    Drop the peaches into boiling water. Keep the water at a simmer for  about half a minute. Remove the peaches, and let them cool. Then  peel, pit, and slice them. Put the peaches with the rest of the  ingredients into a blender. Blend the soup until it is smooth, then  chill it.    Serve with a sprinkling of nutmeg or cardamon.
