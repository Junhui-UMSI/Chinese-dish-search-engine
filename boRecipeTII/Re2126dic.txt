Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast in warm water in a large bowl; let  stand 5 minutes. Add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, 3 cups flour, and next  4 ingredients, stirring until a soft dough forms.    Turn dough out onto floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about  10 minutes); add enough remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent  dough from sticking. Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray,  turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg), free from  drafts, 1 hour or until doubled. Punch dough down, and turn out onto  floured surface; roll into a 17- x 8-inch rectangle. Combine brown sugar  and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough, leaving 1/2-inch margin around edges.  Top with apple and raisins. Roll up tightly, starting at short side,  pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seam and edges to seal.  Place roll, seam side down, in 9- x 5- x 3-inch loaf pan coated with  cooking spray. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 deg), free from  drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled.    Uncover; bake at 350 deg for 35 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when  tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.    Combine powdered sugar and 1-1/2 teaspoons milk; stir well. Drizzle over  loaf. Yield: 1 loaf, 18 servings (serving size: 1 [1/2-inch] slice).
