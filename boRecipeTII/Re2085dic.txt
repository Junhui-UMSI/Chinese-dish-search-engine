Place all ingredients in bread pan, select light crust setting, and press  start. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake  rack, and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing. Books Note: Heres a good,  milk, apple and wheat flavored breakfast toast. This is a very soft bread  when it first comes out of the pan, so its best to wait several hours  before slicing it.
