Heat the oven to 350F.    In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and cream and set aside. Process  the pork fat until finely minced. Transfer to a large bowl. Process the  chicken livers until fine and add to the pork fat.    Whisk together the eggs, onion and garlic. Add the seasonings, then add the  Cognac and Calvados.    To the porkfat mixture, add the ground pork and veal. Blend by hand until  well-combined. Mix in the bread crumbs and cream. Add the egg mixture, then  add the pistachios.    Line two 9"x5"x3" loaf pans with the sliced bacon, leaving some overhang on  the sides and reserving 4 strips for the top. Fill the pans with the meat  mixture, pressing evenly into the corners. Place bay leaves atop and  enclose with the bacon. Cover the pans with a double layer of foil and set  the pans into a larger roasting pan for a bain-marie with 1 to 1-1/2" warm  water.    Bake for 1-3/4 hours, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove the pans from the water and peel off the foil to cool completely. It  is best at this point to cover them with plastic wrap, when cool enough,  and put one atop the other with another weight atop (a foil-covered brick  works nicely), to refrigerate for one week. The weights can be removed  after two days.    To serve, remove the bay leaves and, if desired, leave the bacon but scrape  off the surrounding fat. Serve slightly chilled.
