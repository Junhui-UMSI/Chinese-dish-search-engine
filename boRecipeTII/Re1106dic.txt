Couscous
Couscous; not the instant, Cold water, Vegetable oil, Room temperature water, 
In a large bowl, sprinkle cold water over couscous. Drain and let stand for  15 minutes. Drizzle with oil and stir with a fork or your fingers to  separate the granules. Place in a steamer, sieve or colander and set over  boiling water. (If the holes in your steamer are too large, line with  cheesecloth.) Steam, covered, for 10 minutes. Spoon couscous into a large  dish. Sprinkle with salt water and stir with a fork to separate granules.  Return couscous to steamer, cover, and steam until heated through and  tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes. Heap onto a warm serving platter  and stir with a fork again to separate granules. Yields: 6 to 8 servings.    Notes: The term couscous refers to small semolina pasta granules, as well  as to the various stews that are served with it. In North Africa, both the  grains and the stew are traditionally made in a couscoussier, a vessel with  a stewing pot on the bottom and a steamer on top. As the couscous cooks, it  absorbs the flavours ofthe stew below. A steamer or colander set over a  large, deep pot can be substituted for the couscoussier or you can steam it  separately.
