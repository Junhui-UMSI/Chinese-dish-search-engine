* Any cheese that gratinates well.  Mince the soaked, boneless, skinless, cod fish, the  peeled onions and the cleaned carrots. Place the  vegetables in a skillet with the olive oil, a  tablespoon butter and the minced lard. Wait until the  onion is soft but not brown, quickly add the minced  cod fish, mix with the contents of the skillet and  remove from the range. Add the fresh bread crumbs  soaked in milk but squeezed. Mix everything and set  aside. Prepare a bechamel sauce with 2 cups of milk, 2  tablespoons of flour and 2 tablespoons of butter,  season with salt and pepper and add 4 of the yolks.  Mix the above very well with the cod mixture, place  everything in a tray that can be taken to the oven.  Prepare another bechamel-style sauce as above with the  remaining ingredients, except for the grated cheese  and dry bread crumbs. Cover the contents of the tray  with this sauce, sprinkle with equal parts of grated  cheese and dry bread crumbs, and distribute some  butter nuggets. Bake in a moderate oven (350?) for    20/25    minutes.
