Let cool slightly and remove from pan. Glaze when cool.    GLAZE: Melt butter in saucepan.  Stir in water and sugar.  Boil 5 minutes,  stirring constantly.  Remove from heat; add rum.    In order to glaze the cake, first use a carving fork to poke holes in the  top and sides of the cake.  Slowly spoon glaze over cake.  It will take a  while for the cake to soak up all the glaze.  Sometimes it is necessary to  let the cake stand for five minutes or so in the midst of glazing so it can  absord the liquid. Then continue to glaze the cake until the glaze is all  used up.
