Apple Pancakes
Applesauce, Whole-grain wheat pastry flo, Active dry yeast, Bran, Egg substitute, dried; mixed, WATER; WARM, Water, Apple; peeled and grated, Apple juice, 
Recipe by: McDougall Mix flour and bran. Add applesauce and mix well. Add  yeast to warm water, stir to dissolve. Let rest 5 minutes while grating the  apple. Add the apple juice, grated apple, and yeast mixture to the flour  mixture. Stir batter well. Mix the egg replacer with water, beat until  frothy. Add to batter. Cover batter and let rest for 15 minutes. Cook on  medium-hot non-stick griddle, about 10 minutes on first side, about 5-8  minutes on other side.    HELPFUL HINTS: Ladle the batter on the griddle and flatten cakes, or the  center wont be done. Do not turn until bubbles form on top. These are much  thicker than regular pancakes and take longer to cook.
