Apricot Divinity
Pkg apricot gelatin, Light corn syrup, Sugar, NORMA WRENN, Water, Egg whites, Pecan halves; shelled, 
Mix sugar, syrup and water. Bring to a oil and cook to hard ball stage.  Beat egg whites until stiff, then add gelatin and beat well. Pour in syrup  slowly, beating constantly with a hand-held electric mixer. Beat until  mixture holds its shape; you may have to do this by hand as it gets  stiffer. Drop mixture by spoonfuls onto wax paper. Top each candy with a  pecan half.
