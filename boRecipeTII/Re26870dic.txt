Baked Beans (Kens)
Cheap yellow mustard, Tabasco to taste, Maple syrup, Onion, sliced, Hamburger, browned, Garlic powder, Brown sugar, Liquid smoke, Ginger, Ketchup, (1 pound) baked beans, 1/2, Thick sliced bacon, cooked,, 
Combine all in crockpot, low for 6 hours. Though meal is fully cooked at  start, flavors blend much better at end of time period. This is probably my  most requested recipe.Spice it up to your taste. I add cayenne and habanero  powder for a nice burn.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 15 Sep 96    From:    Dot & Tim McChesney <jrjet@WHIDBEY.NET>    Date:    Mon, 16 Sep 1996 10:13:32 -0700
