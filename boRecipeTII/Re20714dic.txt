Sift together flour, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and soda. Mix oil, eggs and  sugar. Add flour mixture to oil mixture and mix well. Add apples, nuts,  vanilla and brandy; mix again. Batter will be very stiff like a cookie  dough. Spread into lightly greased 13x5x2 inch pan. Bake at 350~ for 35 to  45 minutes. This is a very rich cake and should not be iced. The crust is  crunchy like a cookie and the inside is moist and chewy like a brownie.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Apr  30, 1998
