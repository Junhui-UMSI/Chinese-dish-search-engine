The longer you strain it, the thicker it gets.  To strain, I  place the yogurt in coffee filters inside a strainer (colander) inside a  bowl. You can buy yogurt strainer gizmos (not in Hong Kong unfortunately)  that take up a lot less room in the fridge. I eat this all the time. On  bagels, toast, pancakes, burritos, potatoes. On crackers with sliced  tomatoes.  In soups where I would add sour cream. You can make cheesecakes  (I havent tried that) substituting for cream cheese. It doesnt taste at  all like yogurt to me.
