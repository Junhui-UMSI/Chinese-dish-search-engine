Pizza Crust 1
Sugar, olive oil, Water; lukewarm, All-purpose flour, Salt, 
Dissolve yeast with sugar in 1/4 cup water and proof for 15 minutes.  Combine flour, salt, dissolved yeast, and remaining water. Stir in enough  additional flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto lightly floured surface  and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Turn into  greased bowl, turn to coat all sides of dough with grease. Cover and allow  to rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 45 minutes.    Punch dough down and divide in half. Form each half into a ball and roll  out to fit two 12 inch pizza pans. Top as desired.    Place pans on bottom of preheated 400F oven and bake 10-15 minutes.
