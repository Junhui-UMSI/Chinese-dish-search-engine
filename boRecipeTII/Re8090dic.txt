Potato Bread or Rolls
Hot potato water, Yeast, Crisco, Eggs, Sugar, potatoes, Warm water, Bread flour, Salt, butter, 
Put on 4 to 5 potatoes to boil in salted water until tender. Be sure you  have at least 3 cups of water to boil them in, because you will need 2 cups  of the hot water in the recipe. Pour off 2 cups of potato water and set  aside. Pour out the rest and mash the potatoes. Dissolve 2 pkgs. yeast in 1  cup warm water and set aside. Mix together Crisco, sugar, salt, mashed  potatoes, and potato water. Let cool. Add yeast and eggs. Gradually add  flour to make stiff dough. It will be several cups. Raise dough in greased  bowl (I use a big stainless steel bowl that I coat with cooking oil. Be  sure to cover bowl with dishtowel or something to keep dough out of draft.  Works best in a warm place). When doubled in size, punch down and separate  into either greased loaf pans or make rolls in muffin tins. Brush with  melted butter. Let rise again (be sure to cover). When doubled, bake in 350  oven for 30 to 45 minutes depending on whether your making loafs or rolls  and also how your oven bakes - until golden brown. Remove from oven and  brush with butter again and enjoy some of the best bread you ever ate! When  cool, I store in large ziploc bags.    Posted to T.nt (sdm-marked) Recipes Digest by "Susan G.
