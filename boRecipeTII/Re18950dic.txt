Cook the pasta in boiling, salted water for 4 to 6 minutes, or until just  tender.   Drain the pasta and toss it with 1 tablespoon of the oil to keep  it from sticking together, then keep it warm. Heat the remaining 2  tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet. Add the garlic and saute it lightly;  do not brown. Add the broccoli flowerets and peppers, and saute over medium  heatuntil tender, about 5 to 7 minutes.  Remove the vegetables from the  skillet. Add the cream to the pan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and  simmer until it starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese  and nutmeg, and cook an additional 2 minutes to thicken it a bit more. Add  vegetables and the cooked pasta. Toss them together well. Season with salt  and pepper if needed.  Serve immediately, with additional Parmesan on the  side.
