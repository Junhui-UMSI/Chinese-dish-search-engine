Cut zucchini lengthwise into 3/4" long strips. Cut across in 1/2" pieces to  make about 5-6 cups. Set aside while you bring wine, oil, salt, pepper and  tarragon to a boil. Add zucchini, bring to a boil again. Cover and simmer,  stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes until just barely tender. Pour into  a serving dish, cover and chill several hours or overnight.    Garnish with parsley before serving. Goes nicely with grilled fish, chicken  or ribs.    Source: Medford Mail Tribune, 31 May 1994 Typed by Katherine Smith
