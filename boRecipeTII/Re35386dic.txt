*Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION:       Slice flank  steak across the grain in thin strips no more than 1/8 inch thick. Mix with  meat marinade for       1/2 hour. String and cut green beans in 1 1/2 inch  length. Cut green onions the same length. Combine sauce mixture. Separate  store bought rice noodles so       they will not stick to each other. If  you make your        own noodles, cut them in 1/2 inch wide strips and  separate them. COOKING: Stir fry green beans in 1 tbsp. oil for 3-4  minutes, adding 2 tbsp. water the        last 2 minutes and cover. Set  aside. Add 1 tbsp. oil       and brown the garlic and ginger. Stir fry  beef,            drizzle 1 tbsp. of oyster sauce on top. Set aside. Add 2  tbsp. oil and stir fry noodles, turning and adding a     little water so  theyll soften. It takes about 3-4         minutes. You may find you have  to add more water or oil to keep a steady stream of steam to help soften  the noodles. Add back the vegetables and meat. Add the rest of the oyster  sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil. DO AHEAD NOTES: Do through preparation.  COMMENTS: Rice noodles can be purchased in Chinatown by the pound. They  come in sheets or pre cut. You can easily make your own rice noodles.  Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for MM by Karen Adler  FNGP13B.
