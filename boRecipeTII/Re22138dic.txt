My note: Remove bones from turkey or chicken before serving and  refrigerate or freeze until you have time to prepare the soup. I like  to do it the next day, if possible, and make a batch of crackers  while the soup is cooking.    STOCK: In stockpot or large saucepan, combine bones, water, bay leaf,  celery and onion. (Skin and drippings may be included, if desired.)  Simmer, covered about 4 hours. Strain, reserving stock. Let bones  cool, pick out any meat and add to the stock.    SOUP: In stockpot or saucepan, bring stock to boil; add noodles and  simmer for 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, green onions, zucchini,  basil and thyme. Simmer for 10 minutes.  Stir in hot pepper sauce,  season with salt and pepper to taste.
