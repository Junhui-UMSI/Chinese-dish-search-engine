Helen Mccullys Cranberry Relish
Cranberries, Naval orange; quartered, Sugar, Grand Marnier or bourbon, 
In 2 batches, process the cranberries and orange until evenly chopped, but  not too fine. Transfer to a bowl.    Add the sugar and Grand Marnier and mix well. Taste and add more sugar if  desired.    Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.    NOTE:    If you prefer a tart cranberry dish, try using less sugar than the full cup  ~ taste and add to your own taste.    NOTES : Delicious. A holiday tradition at our house.    Recipe by: Helen McNully    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by KSBAUM@aol.com on Sep 4, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.
