Sweet Little Things
Sugar, Vanilla (to taste), Crescent Rolls (canned), Lemon, Cream cheese, 
Mix all except rolls together in bowl. Seperate rolls, and roll them out  thinner (like pie crust). Place 2 - 3 TB of filling in middle of long edge.  Fold corners up and roll up remaining flap. Bake at 350F until brown (10-12  minutes).  These are quick, easy and great for unexpected company. They  look better if you use clear vanilla.
