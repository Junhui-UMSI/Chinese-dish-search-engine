On a floured  board, divide the dough in half & roll each half into a long roll  about 1 1/2 inches in diameter & about 10 inches long. Set the rolls  on a baking sheet at least 3 inches apart, bake in the top third of  the oven (*325*) for about 25 minutes, or until they are set &  lightly browned on top. Cool the rolls for 5 minutes or so, then  slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices. Lay the slices flat on  the baking sheet & return to the oven for another 10 minutes. Turn  the slices over & bake for another 10 minutes. Cool on a rack, and  keep in a tightly covered tin - they keep for months.
