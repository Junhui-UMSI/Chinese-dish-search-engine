Bacon Waffles
Bacon, waffles, 
I am sure that you have tried these before, but just in case I shall  suggest a favorite of my sons, Channing and Jason.      Fry the bacon first and then place a slice or two on top of the batter  when you put it in the iron. The boys think I thought that up . . . and I  have never had the nerve to tell them the truth.
