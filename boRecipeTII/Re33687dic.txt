Sweet and Creamy Vermicelli (Seviyan)
Hot water, Sugar, almonds, Sultanas, Fine vermicelli, Ghee, Ground cardamom, Saffron strands, 
Break the vermicelli into small pieces less than 2.5cm (1 inch) in length.  They need not be uniform, but longer pieces make stirring difficult.    Heat ghee in a heavy saucepan and fry the vermicelli intil golden brown,  stirring so it colours evenly. Add hot water and saffron and bring to the  boil, then turn heat low, cover and simmer gently until vermicelli is  cooked. Add sugar and sultanas and cook uncovered until liquid is absorbed.  Stir in the almonds and cardamom, stir well and serve warm or chilled with  cream.    Imran C.
