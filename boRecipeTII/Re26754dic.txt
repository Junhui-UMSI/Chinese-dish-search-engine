Nonstick cooking spray, Angel Hair pasta, fully-cooked Shrimp, Green onion, Plum tomatoes, Garlic, fresh basil, Dry white wine, clam chowder, Parmesan cheese, 
Spray a  5 cup or larger capacity baking dish with nonstick cooking  spray. Set aside. Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Cook the angel hair pasta very briefly (about 11/2 minutes) in lightly salted boiling water. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Drain again and set aside.  In a large bowl, combine the thawed shrimp, green onion, tomatoes, garlic,  basil, white wine and clam chowder. Add 3 tablespoons of the parmesan cheese,  reserving 1/2 tablespoon for the top. Stir in the cooked angel hair pasta and toss  to coat the ingredients evenly. Spoon into the prepared baking dish.  Sprinkle the reserved parmesan cheese on top. Lightly coat a sheet of  aluminum foil with nonstick cooking spray and place over the dish, covering tightly. Bake  for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side, if  desired.    You can prepare this dish up to 8 hours in advance and bake it when you are  ready to serve.
