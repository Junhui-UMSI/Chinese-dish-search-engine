Amaretto Cheesecake
Crust, Graham cracker crumbs, Sugar, Cinnamon, Stick margarine; melted, CAKE, Cream cheese, Sugar, Eggs, Amaretto (up to 1/2 cup), TOPPING, Sour cream, Plus 1 tsp. sugar, Amaretto, GARNISHES, Almond halves, Shavings from a Hershey bar, 
Combine crust ingredients and press into the bottom and sides of a 10"  springform pan.    Combine cake ingredients and pour into the crust.  Bake at 375 F. for       45    to       50    minutes.    Turn the oven to 500 F.  Meanwhile, combine topping ingredients. Spread on  the cheesecake and return to the oven for five minutes. (Ms. Barker was  unclear at this point as to whether to leave the oven on while the  cheesecake was in it for the five minutes, or whether to turn the oven off  and just have the remaining heat set the topping ingredients.) Chill  overnight and garnish as desired.    From Sharron Barkers 06/14/90 "Amaretto Bliss" class at The Cookbook  Cottage/1279 Bardstown Rd./Louisville, KY 40204.  Posted by Cathy Harned.
