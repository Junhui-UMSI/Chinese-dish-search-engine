The Worlds Easiest Boston Cream Pie
Yellow cake mix, Margerine, softened, Dry cocoa, (3 oz) vanilla pudding mix, Hot water to make spreading, FOR THE ICING, Confectioners sugar, Salt, 
Well over a year ago Judy Howle posted this recipe on the LIST. It has  become one of Kennys favorites, and he asked me tonight to make it  again...of course I will, with a price. It deserves a re-post.    For the cake: Prepare cake mix according to package directions. Bake in 2  (8 inch) layers. Cool. Freeze one layer for future use.    For the filling: Prepare pudding according to package directions. Cool.    For the icing: Mix together with a wire whisk.    To assemble: Split cooled cake layer. Spread bottom with cooked pudding.  Place top of cake layer over the pudding. Frost top with icing, and let  additional run down sides of cake. Refrigerate 4-6 hours before serving to  make slicing easier.    Note: They dont get much easier than this, and it sure is good. Its easy,  too! Leftovers will keep a couple of days in the fridge, but this never  lasts more than one day at my house.
