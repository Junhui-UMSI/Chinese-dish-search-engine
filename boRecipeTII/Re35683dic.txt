Cut beancurd squares in half diagonally.  Use paring knife and spoon to  make hollow pocket in beancurd. Fill pocket with a tablespoon or so of meat  mixture; dredge meat face with cornstarch. Deep-fry each piece until face  is brown and crusty; drain.    Combine chicken broth, stuffed deep-fried beancurd, whole mushrooms and  peas in clay pot. Bring to boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 10  minutes. Uncover, return to boil, and thicken soup slightly with cornstarch  paste. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
