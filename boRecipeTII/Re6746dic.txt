Sage, dried, Fresh pork fat, Black Pepper, Nutmeg, Vegetable oil, Salt, Cloves garlic, finely minced, Lean pork, ground, Sweet hungarian paprika, Cayenne, Veal, ground, Marjoram, dried, 
Mix all together very well.  Stuff about 8 feet of casing.  Smoke as usual.  Dont get it too dry.    As I said, this is very basic, so I hope you have some experience making  sausage.  If you need further instructions, let me know and Ill call  Charlton. Hope you enjoy it!    Posted to EAT-L Digest  6 November 96    Date:    Thu, 7 Nov 1996 21:12:34 -0500    From:    "Raymond F.
