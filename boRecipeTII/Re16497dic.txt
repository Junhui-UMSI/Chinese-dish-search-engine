Cut pork into approximately 3 cm (1-1/4 inch) pieces leaving some fat on  meat as this is desirable.    Heat half the butter in a heavy based pan and brown potatoes. Remove and  keep aside.    Add remaining butter and brown pork on each side, push to side of pan.    Trim and clean mushrooms and fry quickly in pan next to meat. Stir to  combine.  Reduce heat to low.    Pour in wine, add salt and pepper to taste and place potatoes on top.    Sprinkle with coriander seeds, cover pan with lid and simmer over low heat  for 45 minutes or until pork and potatoes are tender.    Serve with a tossed green salad.    * Source: The Complete Middle East Cookbook, by Tess Mallos * Typed for you  by Karen Mintzias
