Szechwan Cucumber Salad
Red hot peppers cut in thin, Light soy sauce, Sesame oil, Salt, Small dried wood ear, Chinese white vinegar, Sugar, Cucumbers, 
Pour boiling water over tree ears; let stand for 15 minutes.  Peel  cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, scrape out seeds.  Slice into thin  half-moons.  When mushrooms are soft, drain, rinse and dry.  (Slice  em if theyre too big.  Wood ears will quadruple in size when  soaked++SC.) Combine with remaining ingredients.  Let stand for 15  minutes then toss again before serving.    NOTE:  (Wood ears can be found in Chinese markets.  After soaking  they have little taste but lots of crunch.  Theyre there for the  texture.  I cant think of anything to substitute (maybe raw carrots  or water chestnuts) except for dried duck web or jellyfish and youre  much more likely to find wood ears than those items.  Be sure to use  the dark, cooked, Asian sesame oil rather than the light stuff in  health food stores. Id make this before the ribs and chill it well  while doing the rest.)
