Egg whites, Vanilla, Fruit, Granulated sugar, Cornstarch, Heavy cream, Salt, White wine vinegar, Cream of tartar, 
1.  preheat oven to 275 degrees Farenheit    2.  Beat egg whites, salt,& cream of tartar together in a bowl until whites  hold a stiff peak.  (Do not use a plastic bowl the egg whites will not  climb up the side of the bowl.)  Add sugar, a few tablespoons at a time,  beating until mixture is stiff and glossy. Beat in cornstarch, then vinegar  and then vanilla.    3. Butter & and lightly flour a loose bottomed 8 inched cake pan and fill  gently with the meringue mixture, spreading it higher around the edges than  in the center of the pan to form a depression or bowl.    4. Bake cake for 1 hour-1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the meringue is  firm and lightly browned.  Pavlova will remain moist inside.  Cool slightly  the unmold, slide onto serving plate and cool completely. The meringue can  be kept for one day in a plastic bag tightly closed.  5. Lightly whip the cream.  Just before serving , mix in some of the fruit  into the whip cream and spread on the Pavlova.  Top with the rest of the  fruit and garnish the way you want.
