FOR SAUCE: Heat oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion,  carrots and garlic; saute until softened, about 12 minutes. Add beef and  sausages to pan; saute until cooked through, breaking up meat with back of  spoon, about 5 minutes. Add remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer until  flavors blend and sauce measures about 5 cups, stirring occasionally, about  15 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Cool.    FOR LASAGNA: Preheat oven to 350F. Cook noodles in large pot of boiling  salted water until almost tender, about 7 minutes. Drain; cover with cold  water.    Combine ricotta and 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese in medium bowl. Mix in spinach.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix in eggs.    Drain pasta and pat dry. Spread 1/2 cup sauce over bottom of 13x9-inch  glass baking dish. Place 5 noodles over sauce, overlapping to fit. Spread  half of ricotta-spinach mixture evenly over noodles. Sprinkle 2 cups  mozzarella cheese evenly over ricotta-spinach mixture. Spoon 1 1/2 cups  sauce over cheese, spreading with spatula to cover (sauce will be thick).  Repeat layering with 5 noodles, remaining ricotta-spinach mixture, 2 cups  mozzarella and 1 1/2 cups sauce. Arrange remaining 5 noodles over sauce.  Spread remaining sauce over noodles. Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup mozzarella  cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese evenly over lasagna. (Can be prepared up  to 1 day ahead. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate.) Cover  baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake lasagna 40 minutes; uncover and bake  until hot and bubbly, about 40 minutes. Let lasagna stand 15 minutes before  serving.          8    servings.
