This is the cookie recipe I was talking about. This is the one I scaled  down from our cafeteria recipe. It is wonderful, its easy, and it keeps  well in the cookie jar. Our cafeteria manager doesnt make these too often  because of the new guidelines for fats, but when she does, the kids devour  them (and the teachers, too).    (Note: I dont usually measure the 1/8 cup...I just heap the top of the 1  cup measure a bit.)    Cream sugar, oil, and butter. Add eggs and vanilla. With a spoon, stir in  the flour, salt, and soda. Roll into balls the size of a walnut. Roll the  balls in granulated sugar.    Place balls on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten slightly with a glass  that has been dipped in sugar. Bake at 350 degrees until firm, but not  brown, about 8-10 minutes. Remove to rack and cool completely.    Makes 5-6 dozen cookies.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 11 Jan 97, by "Sharon H.
