Tabouli (Bulgur Wheat Salad)
Boiling water, Lemon juice, Black epper, Onion chopped, Diced tomatoes, Whole wheat bulgur, Tomatoes, chopped or 1*16*oz, Salt, 
Put 1 cup of whole wheat bulgur and 1 large chopped onion in a medium Pyrex  bowl and cover with boiling water...let these soak 2 hours (if you like the  bite of raw onion, you can add the onion later...I like it better slightly  cooked by the water).  Drain well and add 1 lb of fresh chopped tomatoes or  one 16 oz can of diced tomatoes, 1/3 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed  tastes much better than from concentrate), 1/4 tsp or more freshly ground  black pepper, and salt to taste. Let it stand for several hours or  overnight in the refrigerator to mix the flavors. Pritikin also suggested  adding fresh mint leaves, chopped, but Ive never had any to try! This is  great in ww pita pockets!    Enjoy...and let me know if you make any yummy variations!    Source: From the original Pritikin Program with modifications.
