Black pepper, Potatoes; medium size, Carrots; diced, Salt, Lima beans, Beef broth; *see note, Celery stalks; diced, Small onion; diced, Margarine; solid, Water, Green peppers; diced, Green beans; chopped, Tomato juice, Corn, 
* Use about 6 cups liquid. You may mix chicken and beef broth (canned  lowfat, not bouillon cubes) with water and tomato juice or vegetable juice  cocktail to suit your tastes.       1. Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in skillet. Add the chopped green  peppers, carrots, celery and onion. Saute on low heat until vegetables are  softened and onion browned lightly. Add this to the broth mixture which has  been placed in a large, heavy pan with lid.     2. Add to this the potatoes, green beans, lima beans and corn. Cover and  simmer for about 45 minutes or until all the vegetables are done. Add the  salt and pepper.     3. Remove about 2 cups of the mixture and put into blender. Puree this  mixture and return to pot with rest of soup. Turn off heat and cover soup.  Best if allowed to set for up to 1 hour to blend flavors.     Since this is a basic recipe for soup, you can add the vegetables you  prefer and follow the directions above to finish the soup. Some  suggestions: Add bay leaf, shredded cabbage, chopped zucchini, diced  turnips, fresh tomatoes, okra or parsley. For added nutrition, serve with a  sprinkling of lowfat cheese on the hot soup. Also good sprinkled with  toasted croutons. This stores very well in refrigerator and is actually  improved with time.
