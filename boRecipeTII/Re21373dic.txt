Union Hotel Chocolate Cake
Vanilla extract, Heavy cream, TOPPING, Cake flour, Eggs, Salt, Squares unsweetened, Baking soda, Strong coffee, Butter, Sugar, Bourbon, Vanilla extract, 
Preheat oven to 275? Grease and flour 2 9 X 5 X 3-inch loaf pans.    Put the chocolate, butter, and coffee in a heavy-bottomed pan of about  16-cup capacity. Place over low heat and stir almost constantly until the  chocolate melts, then stir vigorously until the mixture is smooth and  completely blended.    Set aside to cool for about 10 minutes, then beat in the bourbon, eggs, and  vanilla.    Combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt and sift them together. Add  to the chocolate mixtrure and beat with a wooden spoon until well blended  and smooth.    Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 45 to 55  minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out  clean. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for 15  minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.    Before serving, combine the cream and vanilla and whip until it barely  stands in peaks; it should be fluffy but thin enough to run down the sides  of the cake when you place a spoonful on each serving.    Makes 2 loaves.    NOTE:"In the words of one chocolate lover, this cake, which is on the menu  at the venerable Union Hotel in Benicia, a small town at the mouth of the  Sacramento Delta, is so good that it can make you cry. It is a dark, rich,  moist loaf, quickly and easily mixed with a spoon in a saucepan - you do  not need an electric beater. Sliced thickly, it requires no icing, just a  spoonful of unsweetened whipped cream."
