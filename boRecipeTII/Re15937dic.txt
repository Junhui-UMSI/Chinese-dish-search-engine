Lukewarm water, All purpose flour, Vegetable shortening, melted, Salt, Cold water, Active dry yeast (1/4 oz), 
In a large bowl, soften the yeast in the lukewarm water.  Mix the salt, 2  tablespoons of the shortening, and the cold water together and add to the  yeast mixture.    Sift in the flour gradually, beating well after each addition for a smooth  consistency.  You will probably have to knead in the final cup of flour.    Shape the dough into a ball, brish lightly with the remaining shortening,  and cover with a dry cloth.  Set the bowl in a warm place until doubled in  bulk, anout 1 hour.    Punch the dough down and, on a floured board, knead about 5 minutes. Shape  into 2 round loaves on a well greased baking sheet.  Cover with a dry cloth  and set to rise another 45 minutes.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Bake the loaves on a cookie sheet 50  minutes, until they are light brown and sound hollow when tapped. *****    This is an adaptation of the traditional recipe that is still being used by  almost every Native American family.
