Add steamed  vegetables, onion mixture, and shredded cheese. Mix gently but thoroughly.  Preheat oven to 375.  Oil large baking sheet and set aside. Place 1 phyllo  sheet on work surface (cover remaining phyllo with plastic wrap to prevent  drying.)  Brush with melted butter. Stack remaining phyllo sheets on top,  brushing all but the last sheet with butter. Spread vegetable mixture onto  dough, leaving 3" border on all sides.  Fold in short ends of dough, then  fold in long sides, overlapping at center. Brush with butter to seal.  Carefully transfer strudel to prepared baking sheet. Brush top with butter.  Sprinkle with sesame seed if desired.   Bake until golden, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Transfer to heated platter and  serve immediately.  Accompany with Hollandaise sauce.
