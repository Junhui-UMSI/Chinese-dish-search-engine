Arroz Y Gandules
See Below, 
While sofrito is simmering, cook 2 cups rice.  Set aside.  Also prepare 1  lb dry or two cans, drained pigeon peas. To prepare dry peas, simply cook  in boiling salted water until done; drained peas can simply be tossed with  cooked rice.  Place rice in pot large enough to hold rice, peas, and  sofrito. (Add them to pot in this order). Toss until thoroughly mixed and  warmed. It may be necessary to rewarm the rice mixture.
