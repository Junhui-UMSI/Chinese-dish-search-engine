1. Pulse tomatoes in a food processor two or three times, leaving some  chunks.    2. In a saucepan, saute onion in olive oil over medium-high heat for two to  three minutes, or until soft. Add garlic and saute another minute.    3. Add tomatoes and parsley, cook for 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to  taste. Set aside.    4. Boil penne in a large pot of salted water until done a la dente. Drain.    5. In a large frying pan, toss pasta with melted butter. Add balsamic  vinegar, toss again.    6. Add tomato sauce and parmesan cheese (optional) and toss. Turn out into  pasta bowls. Serve immediately.    I decreased the olive oil, butter and eliminated the Parmesan cheese from  the original recipe that Naralon posted. Like she stated ... this is  absolutely excellent.
