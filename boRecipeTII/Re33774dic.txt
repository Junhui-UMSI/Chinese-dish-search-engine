In medium nonmetal bowl, combine all marinade ingredients; mix well.  Add  fish, turning to coat all sides.  Cover; refrigerate 30 minutes to 2 hours.    Drain fish,  reserving marinade.  On metal skewers, arrange fish, water  chestnuts, pineapple and peppers.  When ready to barbecue, place kabobs on  grill over medium heat.  Brush with marinade; cook 16-20 minutes or until  fish flakes easily with fork, turning once and brushing frequently with  marinade.    NOTES:  I usually add cherry tomatoes and small whole mushrooms to the  kebabs, also.  And remember, my cooking software estimates nutritional  values higher than MC.
