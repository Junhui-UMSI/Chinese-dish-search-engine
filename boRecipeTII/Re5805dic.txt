Place the beans in a large pot and cover generously with water. Bring to a  boil. Reduce the heat to mediumlow and cook, covered, until the beans are  creamy inside, but not mushy, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Drain beans and  transfer to a large bowl to cool. Cook shells in rapidly boiling salted  water. When done, drain in a colander, then spread shells on a cookie sheet  to allow steam to escape. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil. When cool,  combine pasta with the pinto beans. Add peppers. In a small bowl, combine  the remaining ingredients. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss gently to  combine.    To roast chiles and peppers: Place over a gas flame or on a tray under a  broiler. Keep turning so that the skin is evenly charred, without burning  and drying out the flesh. Transfer charred peppers to a plastic or paper  bag, tie the top closed and allow to steam until cool to the touch, about  fifteen minutes. (To speed things up, place bag in a bowl of ice water.)  Peel the peppers by hand, then dip the them briefly in water to remove any  blackened bits.
