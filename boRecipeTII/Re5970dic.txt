Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Culinary Technique: Cover Page Cooking: Recipes Featured in Eating Well  Magazine: Holiday Issue Culinary Technique is a class where the pick a  specific aspect of cooking and really give you the ins and outs of it.  Cover Page Cooking is a new class that from these results, I hope they keep  around. Cover Page takes the recipes that are featured on the "cover" of  magazines and shows you how to prepare and present them to look just as  good.    Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with  non-sick cooking spray.    In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add pistachios and stir  until the butter is lightly browned and the nuts are toasted, about 1  minute. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Whisk in sugar. Add flour,  egg white and cardamom or ginger and whisk until smooth.    Drop the batter by heaping teaspoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, onto  prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden. With a  spatula, immediately transfer the cookies to a rack to cool. (If the  cookies begin to stick before all are removed, briefly return the pan to  the oven).
