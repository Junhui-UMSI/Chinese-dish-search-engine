Vegetables and Rice
Black beans, rinsed &, Parsnips, sliced thin (peel, Bok choy, chopped/sliced, in, 
Put the sliced parsnips in a casserole (at least 4 qt.) with a tablespoon  of water. Microwave on high for five minutes or until a fork can pierce the  slices.  Dump the black beans in, and stuff the bok choy on the top.  If  the water has dried up, add a little more. Microwave until the bok choy is  wilted and the stem tender-crisp. Stir and serve over cooked rice. Let  everyone add their own teriaki sauce.    The natural flavors of the vegetables make this appealing, so go easy on  the sauce or any spices you are inclined to add.
