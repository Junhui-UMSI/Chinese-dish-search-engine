Put the espresso in a wide bowl and  soak each ladyfinger briefly.  Arrange half of the ladyfingers in a  rectangular serving dish.  In another bowl, beat the egg yolks with the  sugar until it turns pale yellow. Add the mascarpone, rum, and triple sec;  stir to combine. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff. Fold  whites into the mascarpone mixture. Layer half of the mixture atop the  ladyfingers in a serving dish. Add another layer of ladyfingers, followed  by the remaining mascarpone mixture. Dust liberally with cocoa. Cover and  refrigerate at least one hour before serving.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
