Quick Maple Fudge
Brown sugar, Heavy cream, Pure maple syrup, 
Here are several maple fudge recipes from my collection. They are taken  from a French cookbook called "Les Ptits Becs Sucres De La Beauce" which,  loosely translated, means "Sweets lovers from the Beauce" (the Beauce is a  region of southeastern Quebec that is the main maple syrup production  center of the province). Here they are:    Cook all ingredients together to the soft ball stage (about 238 degrees F).  Remove from heat and stir until the mixture is smooth. Pour into a buttered  dish and let cool.
