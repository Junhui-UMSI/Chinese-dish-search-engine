If anyone  can obtain good tomatoes I would highly recommend it. Organic tomatoes  would be best because they have much more flavour.    From (The Australian Womens Weekly Basic Cookbook) Adapted slightly to  meet Fatfree list requirements.    NOTE: (Original recipe asked for a chicken stock cube, which I omitted and  didnt miss. You may want to add salt to compensate.)    1. Using a shape knife, carefully remove cores from tomatoes (dig from the  top, you don;t need to remove the entire middle), cut small crosses at  opposite ends. Place tomatoes in medium saucepan with enough boiling water  to cover them. Boil for about 30 seconds; strain immediately, place into  bowl of iced water. Peel away skin. (I thought this sounded hard, but it is  really quite straightforward.    2. Chop tomatoes roughly    3. In a medium saucepan, saute onions and garlic in water for about three  minutes. Add tomatoes then remaining ingredients. Bring to boil, reduce  heat, cover. Simmer 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf. Blend or process mixture.  This is a lovely fresh and light soup. I invited some friends who live  around the corner to bring over some fresh bread and we all had a great  lunch together. The whole process took about an hour. The recipe book says  it keeps for two days in the fridge and can be frozen for up to two months.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #47    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
