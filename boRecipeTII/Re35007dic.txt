Makes 4 to 6 Servings    Fresh bean sprouts are a must for this recipe from Chinas Hunan province.  The canned variety dont have the requisite crispness. Keep a close eye on  the toasting sesame seeds so they dont burn.    PREHEAT OVEN TO 300F. Toast the sesame seeds by spreading them over the  bottom of a pie tin. Roast for 12-to-16 minutes, stirring often, until they  are golden. The seeds can be toasted in advance and stored in an airtight  container. Place the bean sprouts in a large heatproof bowl and set it  aside. In a medium-size skillet set over moderately low heat, stir-fry the  garlic, scallions and ginger in the oil for 2 to 3 minutes, until they are  limp. Add all the remaining ingredients, increase the heat to moderate,  then boil the mixture, uncovered, for 1 minute to slightly reduce the  liquid. Pour the boiling dressing over the bean sprouts, toss well, then  cover the bowl and chill the salad for several hours. Toss again before  serving.
