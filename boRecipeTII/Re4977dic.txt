Pickled Onions, New Orleans Style
TINY YELLOW ONIONS (UP TO 1, INCH IN DIAMETER), Water, LIQUID CRAB BOIL, Bay Leaves, DISTILLED WHITE VINEGAR, Crushed red pepper, RED FOOD COLORING (OPTIONAL), SWEET BASIL, COOL WATER, Salt, 
PEEL THE ONIONS AND PLACE IN A GLASS OR PLASTIC CONTAINER - NOT METAL!!!  MIX THE WATER AND SALT, POUR OVER THE ONIONS AND LET SOAK OVERNIGHT.  THE  NEXT DAY, TAKE CLEAN CANNING JARS AND SPRINKLE SOME OF THE RED PEPPER,  BASIL AND ONE BAYLEAF ON THE BOTTOM.  PACK THE ONIONS TO THE 1/3 LEVEL,  THEN REPEAT IN LAYERS TILL FULL.  WHEN ALL JARS ARE PACKED, MIX THE  VINEGAR, WATER, CRAB BOIL AND FOOD COLORING (IF DESIRED) AND POUR OVER  ONIONS. CAP THE JARS AND REFRIGERATE FOR AT LEAST ONE WEEK BEFORE USING. IF  YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT YOURRE MAKING, JUST MAINTAIN A 3:1 RATION VINEGAR  TO WATER.  FANTASTIC WITH RED BEANS AND RICE!!!!
