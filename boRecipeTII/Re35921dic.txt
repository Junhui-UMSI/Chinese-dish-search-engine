Meats are up to you. Try imitation crab, baby shrimp, bacon, lobster, tuna,  smoked salmon or marlin, or what have you, to make 1/2 pound.    Melt butter on low heat in a skillet. Stir in flour, add milk slowly,  stirring until of heavy soup consistency. Add remaining ingredients except  meat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until cheese is fully melted. Remove  mushroom stems and hollow out caps. Chop the meat finely and add to the  sauce; simmer to a sticky hamburger consistency. Mound stuffing in mushroom  caps and broil to a golden brown. Works well on the barbecue. Stuffing may  also be used as a spread for crackers.
