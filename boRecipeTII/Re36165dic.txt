Marinated Beef: In a deep bowl, combine 1 clove garlic, crushed  peppercorns, allspice, 1 ts salt, and wine. Stir to dissolve salt. Add beef  cubes, pressing cubes down into marinade to immerse as much as possible.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Remove beef and  garlic from marinade with a slotted spoon, reserving marinade. Pat beef and  garlic dry on paper towels.    Beef Stew: In a 6 quart non-reactive oven-going pot, heat olive oil and  garlic over medium-high heat. Add meat in 2 batches, searing meat on all  sides until deep brown. Return all meat to pot. Pour in reserved marinade  and beef boullion. Add bouquet garni. Bring to a boil. Boil gently for 10  minutes. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.    Preheat oven to 350F. Layer carrots, onions, turnips and mushrooms atop  meat mixture in casserole. Cover and bake at 350F for 1 1/2 hours until  meat and vegetables are tender. Remove bouquet garni. Stir in frozen peas.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and bake 4-5 minutes until peas  are cooked. Spoon stew and cooking juices into individual serving bowls.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
