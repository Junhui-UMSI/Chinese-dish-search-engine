Timman (Iraqi-Style Rice)
olive oil, Jasmine rice, 
Wash rice in cool water and drain. In a large pot, put in rice with  water to cover by 3-4". Bring to boil and cook for 6 minutes. Test by  biting a grain of rice: The outside should be soft but the inside  still hard. Transfer rice to a sieve and rinse. Add oil to the pot  and put wet rice back in. Place a kitchen towel over the pot and  replace the lid. Cook on low heat for 45-55 minutes, or until fluffy.  At the bottom of the pot a crunchy layer will form that is everyones  part.    Makes 10-12 servings.    Per serving: 226 calories, 4 grams protein, 44 grams carbohydrates, 3  grams fat, 0 gram saturated fat, 0 milligram cholesterol, 3 milligrams  sodium.
