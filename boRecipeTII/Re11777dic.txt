Note:  Most supermarkets carry salsas in varying degrees of hotness. For  this dish, we recommend using one that packs a substantial wallop.    BARBECUE SAUCE:      Combine all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl, and whisk until the  sauce is well blended.  Adjust seasonings to taste.    Makes 3 cups.    RIBS:      1.  Combine all the braising liquid ingredients in a large pot. Stir  well, and bring to a simmer over medium heat.      2.  Add the ribs, and simmer until tender but not falling apart, about  1 hour and 45 minutes.  When done, carefully transfer the ribs to a baking  sheet.      3.  Combine all the spice mixture ingredients in a medium-size bowl,  and stir to form a paste.  (Add more beer if it is too dry.)      4.  Rub the paste over all surfaces of the ribs. Wrap each slab in  aluminum foil, dull side out, and refrigerate until ready to cook. (These  can be prepared up to 4 days in advance.)      5.  Preheat the oven to 400F, and prepare hot coals for grilling. Place  the rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat.      6.  Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the ribs on the  foil.  Coat the ribs with 2 cups of the barbecue sauce, and bake on the  center rack of the oven for 10 minutes.      7.  Transfer the ribs to the grill, and cook long enough to char. Serve  immediately, with the remaining 1 cup barbecue sauce on the side.          4    portions.    Authors note:  One of Americas finest chefs, Jimmy Schmidt -- of the  Rattlesnake Club in Denver -- has made these one of his signature dishes.  The three sauces created deep hot flavor -- these are real mean western  ribs.    Recipe from Michelle M. Bass.
