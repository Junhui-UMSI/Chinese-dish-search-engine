Zucchini and Tomatoes Parmesan
Tomatoes, Zucchini, Chicken broth, Seasoned bread crumbs, Parmesan; grated, Basil, 
Preheat oven to 425F.  Trim zucchini with self-sharpening knife and cut  into 3/8-to-1/2 inch thick slices with Vario-slicer. Arrange in the DDB.  Season with salt and pepper and brush with chicken broth.  Bake 12 minutes,  or until almost tender.  Remove from oven but leave oven on.    Place a slice of tomato on each zucchini slice.  Combine bread crumbs with  cheese and basil in Batter Bowl.  Return to oven and bake 5-6 minutes,  until crumbs are lightly browned.    Note: Can be done in one step, but squash may not be soft when done. Great  for a show, if they are the Zucchini type. Posted by Sarah Gruenwald.
