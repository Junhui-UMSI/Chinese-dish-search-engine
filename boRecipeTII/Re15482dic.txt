White Chocolate Cheesecake #3
White chocolate, Cream cheese, softened, Pound cake crumbs, Apricot brandy, Sour cream, Vanilla, Sugar, 
Melt white chocolate over low heat in a double boiler.   Set aside to cool slightly.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Distribute pound  cake crumbs evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Press crumbs  down lightly. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together cream cheese,  sugar, vanilla, and apricot brandy with an electric mixer for at least five  minutes or until very smooth.  Add melted white chocolate and blend another  five minutes.   Add sour cream and mix to combine.  Pour into crumb lined pan and bake at      350    degrees for 30 minutes.   Chill overnight before serving. This cheesecake freezes very well, and  makes about 12-14 slices.  It goes well with commercial fruit sauces or  fresh fruit but it is so delicious that it really doesnt need anything  else!  It does look nice when it is garnished with fresh raspberries and  mint sprigs though.  This one has been described as "to die for"!!!
