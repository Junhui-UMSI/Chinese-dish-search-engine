Sugar, peanuts, Vegetable oil, Fresh red chile, Shallot, shrimp, Juice of 1 lime, Garlic, Kosher salt, Assorted fruits *, 
* (sliced green apples, pears, tangerine or orange sections, grapefruit or  pomelo, halved and seeded grapes, strawberries, firm papaya).    Recipe courtesy of Chalie Amatyakul, director, Thai Cooking School at The  Oriental, Bangkok.  Reprinted from "Southeast Asian Cooking," by Jay Harlow  (Ortho Books, 1987).    Cut the fruit into bite-sized pieces.  If using pomelo, peel the individual  sections and break them apart into grains about the size of a grape seed.  Toss apple or pear slices in a little citrus juice to keep them from  oxidizing.    Using a small skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over low heat and gently  fry the shallot and garlic in it until lightly browned. Remove and drain on  paper towels. Discard the oil or reserve it for another use.    Combine the lime juice, salt and sugar (if used) in a medium bowl and stir  to dissolve.  Add the fruits, shrimp and half the garlic and shallot: toss  to coat evenly with dressing. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.  Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the remaining garlic and  shallot, peanuts and chile shreds.    Serves 4.    San Francisco Chronicle, 3/9/88.
