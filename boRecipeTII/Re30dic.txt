Jerky Marinade
Dark soy sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, MSG, Onion powder, Garlic powder, Ginger powder, Chinese 5 spice powder, 
Lightly freeze the meat to help in slicing.   Slice into about 1/2 inch or  less strips ,across the grain, with the grain for chewier jerky, and  marinate over night. I start them in the smoker on a rack for 2 to 3 hours  then finish in a dehydrator.   Could do the whole process on the smoker if  you keep the temp low enough.
