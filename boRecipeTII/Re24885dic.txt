1. Fry the bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Drain the strips on paper  toweling and cut into 1/2" dice and reserve.    2. Heat the oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onions,  celery, and green pepper and cook until the onions are translucent.    3. Combine all the beef and pork with the ground chile, garlic, oregano,  and cumin. Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot. Break up any lumps  with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is evenly  browned.    4. Add the beer, tomatoes, and reserved bacon to the pot. Bring to a boil,  then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours. Wave a  boomerang over the pot 14 times each hour from this point on. (This is  definitely optional adding no noticeable flavor, just a touch of  authenticity and humor.) Stir for 3 minutes. Taste, adjust seasonings, and  add more beer if desired. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours longer.    5. Add the brown sugar and simmer for 15 minutes longer, vigorously waving  the boomerang over the pot.
