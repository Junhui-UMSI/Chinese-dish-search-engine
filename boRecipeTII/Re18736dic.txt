I did       and she       enjoyed it saying it was one of the best ones she tasted so far.       Here is her       recipe/ my conversion with minor changes. The bread is a med loaf,       semi       coarse grain, moist texture, good crisp crust with great flavor.       It was       wonderful warm and made great toast the next day.She and I still       have ideas       to even improve it more, but it a great one as a base recipe.
