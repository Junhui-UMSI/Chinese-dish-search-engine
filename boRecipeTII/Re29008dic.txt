Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a small saucepan, combine the raisins  and wine and bring to a simmer. Remove from the heat and let stand 15  minutes to allow the raisins to plump. Strain the raisins and drain well,  reserving any liquid. Place the pears in a baking dish just large enough to  hold them. Combine the raisins with the pine nuts and fill the cavities of  the pears. Put the butter, brown sugar, white wine, lemon zest and the  reserved raisin liquid in the saucepan and simmer to melt the sugar,  approximately 2 minutes. Drizzle over the pears. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes  or until the pears are tender when pierced with a toothpick, basting  occasionally with the juices. Serve the warm pears in shallow wide-rimmed  bowls. Spoon the Sherry Custard Sauce around and sprinkle with crushed  Amaretti Cookies. Garnish with the mint sprigs, if desired.
