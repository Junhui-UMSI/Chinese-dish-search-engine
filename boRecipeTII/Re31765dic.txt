Heat oil in a large casserole.  Saute onion & garlic until the onion is  tender.  Add cumin & coriander. Saute for another minute over medium heat.    Add cayenne pepper, lentils, bay leaf & water.  Bring to a boil. Add salt &  pepper to taste, cover, reduce heat & simmer for 45 minutes. Simmer only  until the lentils are just tender. Adjust seasonings.
