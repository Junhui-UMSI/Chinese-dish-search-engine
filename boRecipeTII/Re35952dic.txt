Someone on this list (sorry I forgot who) asked for a recipe for Stuffed  Pepper Soup.  I found this in the Oct/Now 96 issue of Taste of Home.  I  hope its what you were looking for:    In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, brown beef;  drain.  Add remaining  ingredients;  bring to a boil.  Reduce heat;  cover and simmer for 30-40  mins or until peppers are tender.    Yield 10 servings.
