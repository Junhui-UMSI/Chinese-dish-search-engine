Asopao De Pollo
Onion, Salt, Pimiento Stuffed Olives, Medium Grain Rice, Garlic, Parmesan cheese, Oregano, Pimentos, Smoked Ham, Green Peas, Bacon, Tomatoes, Chicken, Green Bell Pepper, Capers, 
In a small bowl, combine the oregano, garlic and salt.  Rub the seasonings  on the chicken pieces.    In a large enameled cast iron casserole, cook the bacon over moderately low  heat until the fat is rendered.  Remove the bacon and reserve for another  use.  Add half the chicken and cook over moderately high heat, turning,  until browned all over, about 7 minutes.  Transfer to a plate and brown the  remaining chicken to the pan and add the ham, tomatoes, onion and green  pepper. Cover and simmer over low heat until the chicken is cooked through,  about 25 minutes.  Let cool.    Remover the chicken meant from the bones.  Discard the skin and bones and  return the meat to the pan.  Add 6 1/2 cups of water and the capers and  olives and simmer for 5 minutes.   Stir in the rice and 1 teaspoon salt and  simmer until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes.    Season the *asopao* with salt.  Garnish with the peas and pimientos and  sprinkle with the Parmesan.  Serve at once; otherwise it will lose its  characteristic soupiness.

Asapao can be as       basic as       the rural "three can" variation, in which chicken and rice are       fancied up       with a can of green peas, a can of pimientos and a can of       asparagus tips,       or it can be a sublime dish that brings out the flavors of the       freshest of       ingredients.
