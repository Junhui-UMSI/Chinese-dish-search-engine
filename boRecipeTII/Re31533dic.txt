Sweet-Sour Cucumber Salad
White vinegar, Cucumbers, Salt, 
You take the cukes, peel them and then thinly slice them on a grater or a  Mouli.  Layer these in a colander and sprinkle salt on each layer. Let  these sit at least 1/2 hour so they wilt. Thoroughly wash off the salt.  Meanwhile, mix white vinegar in about equal proportions with sugar. Toss  the cucumbers with this and chill.  You may need to adjust the ratio to  your personal taste.    For a salad of 3 cucumbers, Id maybe use 1/4- 1/3 c. each of vinegar and  sugar.    You could add dill seed to this, but I prefer it plain.    From: Christel=Reeve%SQA%Banyan@magnolia.banyan.com. Fatfree Digest [Volume  9 Issue 30] July 21, 1994.
