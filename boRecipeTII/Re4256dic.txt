Perfectly Strained Stock for Soup
***  NON   NE *****, 
After making a rich meat stock, allow it to chill in the refrigerator  overnight. Then skim the surface with a slotted spoon to remove any  solidified fat. Place damp cheesecloth in a strainer, and freeze until  firm. Pour the skimmed stock through the lined strainer to remove very last  vestige of fat. Use perfectly strained stock in your favorite soup or  sauce.
