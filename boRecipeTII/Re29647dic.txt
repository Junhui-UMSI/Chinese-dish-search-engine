*We like the pasta broken up into about 2-3" pieces. It makes it a little  easier to eat.    In medium bowl, combine shrimp with 1/3 cup Newmans Own Light Italian  Dressing. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. In small bowl, with wire whisk or  fork, mix peanut butter, soy sauce, honey, ginger, crushed red pepper and  remaining dressing; set aside. Prepare capellini as label directs; drain.    Meanwhile, in 4 quart saucepan over high heat, heat vegetable and sesame  oils until very hot. Add carrot and cook 1 minute. Drain shrimp; discard  dressing. Add shrimp and green onions to carrot and cook, stirring  constantly, approximately 3 minutes or until shrimp turn opaque. In large  bowl, toss hot capellini with peanut butter and shrimp mixtures. Sprinkle  with chopped cilantro, if desired.
