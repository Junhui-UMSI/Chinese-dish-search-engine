Cranberry Relish in Orange Cups
Ground cloves, Cranberries, Oranges, Light Brown Sugar, Orange juice, Water, Crystallized Ginger, Ground ginger, 
Ingredients: Cut the oranges in half and remove pulp. (The Kitchen Staff  recommends you save the oranges for your post- Thanksgiving Day Breakfast  and serve as part of a fruit salad.) Cover and store orange shells in the  refrigerator; they will keep well for 2 days.    To loosen the pulp from the shell, cut around the inside of each orange  half with the knife. Using a small spoon, carefully remove the pulp and  discard (or reserve as recommended), leaving the orange shell intact.    In a large saucepan, stir together the brown sugar, orange juice, water,  crystallized ginger, ground ginger, and cloves. Bring the mixture to a boil  over high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat to  medium-high and cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes, stirring  occasionally.    Add the cranberries and return the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce  heat again to medium-high, and boil for 3 to 5 minutes or until skins pop,  stirring occasionally.    Transfer the relish to a covered container and refrigerate for at least 1  hour before serving. You may store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.  Spoon the cranberry relish into the orange shells to serve.    Kitchen Staff Tip: Prepare todays recipe in a wonderful orange cup with a  zigzag cut. To do so, use a small serrated knife and score a line around  the middle of each orange. Then, using the line as a guide, cut each orange  in half in a zigzag pattern to make a decorative edge. Pretty and tasteful  presentation for your Thanksgiving Day Dinner table.
