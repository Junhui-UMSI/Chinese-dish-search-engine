To clarify the butter; In a small heavy saucepan melt the butter over low  heat. Remove the pan from the heat and let the butter stand 3 minutes. Skim  the froth off and pour the butter through a sieve lined with a double  thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth into a bowl, discarding any  milky solids in the bottom of the pan.    In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla and rum. Transfer  1/2 of the mixture to a large shallow baking dish (about 13 X 9 X 2 inches)  and soak half of the bread slices 10 minutes. Turn slices over and soak 10  minutes more. In another large shallow baking dish spread half of the corn  flakes and coat the soaked bread slices on each side, transferring to a  tray when coated. Soak and coat the remaining slices with the remaining egg  mixture and corn flakes in the same manner.    Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.    In a large heavy skillet heat 2 Tbsps of the clarified butter over moderate  heat until hot but not smoking and cook 2 or 3 slices (or as many will fit  in one layer) 3 minutes on each side, or until puffed and golden brown.  Transfer the French toast as cooked to a baking sheet and keep warm in the  oven. Cook the remaining slices in the remaining butter in the same manner.    When ready to serve sprinkle the French toast with the cinnamon sugar and  serve with the accompaniments.    NOTES :      Have tried this and its a keeper.
