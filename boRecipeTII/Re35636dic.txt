Note: Feel free to substitute your favorite soy meat-like product for those  in the recipe.    Slice the bread so that you cut off the top third of the loaf. Scoop out  the inside of the lid and bottom with your fingers, leaving a generous wall  of bread. In a small bowl, mix the balsamic vinegar and the Pesto. In  another bowl mix together the artichoke hearts and olives. Spread the Pesto  mixture on the underside of the lid and in the bottom and along the sides  of the bread. This will glue all the other ingredients together.    Place the un-turkey slices in a layer on the bottom of the loaf over the  Pesto. Next layer one half of the cheese, followed by a layer of the soy  baloney and another layer of cheese. Then layer the red pepper, the red  onion slices, the lettuce leaves and the tomato slices. Finally, add the  artichoke-olive mixture. The loaf will be very full. Place the lid back  onto the bread and press down firmly. Wrap the loaf tightly in plastic wrap  to bind it together and then in aluminum foil. Place in the refrigerator  for at least 4-5 hours or overnight. Cut into slices to serve.
