I have no idea where my  Aunt found it, but I think it is delicious.    Bring the can of crushed pineapple to a boil.  Add cream cheese, package of  orange jello and apricot babyfood.  Mix all with and electric beater.  (Carfull it splatters - I put the bowl in the sink) Cover and chill -  before fully set fold the package of dream whip in.
