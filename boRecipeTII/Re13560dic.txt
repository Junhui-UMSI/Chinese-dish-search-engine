Wiener Schnitzel (Breaded Pork Cutlets)
Eggs, milk, Lard, Plain bread crumbs, Pork cutlets, flour, 
Dip cutlets into flour. Mix eggs and milk. Dip cutlets into egg-milk  mixture. Carefully coat with bread crumbs, not too heavily. Let stand for 5  to 10 minutes to seal coating. Deep fry cutlets until browned on both  sides, about 3 or 4 minutes. Turn cutlets several times during cooking. Do  not pierce.    Remove cutlets from lard with tongs and drain over pan for a few seconds  before removing to absorbent paper.    http://www.iowafarmer.com/cooks/schmink1.htm    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 15, 1998
