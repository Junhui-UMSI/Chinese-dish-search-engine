And here is a recipe for Tangy Fishermans Stew that I found in USA Today  week-end in an article called Ten Ways to A Healthy Heart. I made it for my  husband and I and its really very good. I used red snapper.    Saute garlic & peppers in oil til tender. Add tomatoes, water, potatoes,  cumin, parsley, and hot pepper, and bring to a boil. Simmer 20 minutes or  til potatoes are tender. To slightly thicken stew, use back of a spoon to  mash some potatoes against the side of the pan. Add fish and simmer ten  minutes or until fish is done. Serve with warm Italian or French bread.  Serves four.
