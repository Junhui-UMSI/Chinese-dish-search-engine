When the water in the medium-size pot has returned to a boil, add the  shrimp and cook for 2 minutes, or until opaque. Drain, and rinse shrimp  under cold water. Set aside.    Add the rice noodles to the large pot of boiling water. Boil for 4-5  minutes, drain, and rinse under cold water.    In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, shallot, lime juice, fish  sauce, 1/2 cup water, sugar, and pepper flakes until the sugar is  dissolved. Divide the dressing into four small bowls.
