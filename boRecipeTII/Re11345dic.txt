Ranch-Style Lentil Casserole
Cooked lentils, Ground beef, Catsup, Water, Cooking oil, Vinegar, Onion soup mix, Prepared mustard, 
Preheat oven to 400-degrees F.    Brown ground beef in oil and drain (you may not need oil at all to brown  the beef, use your judgement)    Stir in remaining ingredients. Place in casserole dish.    Bake for 30 minutes.    This freezes very nicely.    Recipe by: From A-1 (Kennebec Bean Co.)    Posted to brand-name-recipes by "cathylee@mindspring.com"  <cathylee@mindspring.com> on Mar 16, 1998
