Sweet Potatoes in Praline Sauce
Butter, Salt, Sugar, PRALINE SAUCE, Pecans, Corn syrup, Salt, Sweet potatoes, Water, Vanilla, 
SERVES 8      If you do not like sweet, rich foods on your table, avoid this one. On  the other hand, the children will love you for it. The sauce is from New  Orleans.      Boil the potatoes in salted water until not quite tender, about 15  minutes.      Prepare the sauce by melting the sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium  heat. In a short time the sugar will begin to turn to a light golden brown.  Stir to prevent burning. When light brown syrup is formed, immediately add  the corn syrup, followed by the water. Blend thoroughly. Allow to cool for  just a moment and then stir in the pecans, butter, salt, and vanilla. If  you wind up with a small sugar lump or two, do not worry about it. Simply  remove the offending lump.      Place the potatoes in a greased baking dish. Pour some of the sauce over  the potatoes and bake at 375? for about 20 minutes.      This sauce is very rich and I expect that you will want to save some of  it for ice cream tomorrow.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
