Peanut Fudge #2
Sugar, Butter or regular margarine, Vanilla, Baking chocolate; cut up, Light corn syrup, milk, Peanuts; salted, chopped, 
Combine milk, corn syrup, sugar and chocolate in a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved.  Continue cooking over medium heat until the candy reaches the soft ball  stage (236 F) on the candy thermometer. Stir occasionally to prevent  sticking. Remove from heat and add butter. Cool to 110 F without stirring,  then add the vanilla. Beat until fudge begins to lose its shine. Stir in  the peanuts and quickly pour into a greased 8-inch square baking pan. Cut  into squares when candy is completely cooled. Makes 1 1/2 pounds.
