In 1965, he (along with  Arthur Whitman) published "Walter Jettons LBJ Barbecue Cook Book."  I have  mentioned it a couple of times in posts, and, since the book is long out of  print, I got several requests to post some of the recipes.  Here are some  of my favorites, along with Jettons comments and instructions...    The easiest way to get yourself a good baked bean dish is to buy yourself  some canned baked beans and then procede as follows.    Mix all the ingredients in a skillet and cook on the grill about 15 minutes  so the flavors can blend.  Some canned tomatoes on top will pep up the  color and add to the flavor.    bbq-digest V2 #058    From the BBQ recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
