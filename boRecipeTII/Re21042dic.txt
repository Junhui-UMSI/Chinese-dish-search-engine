Twice Baked Potatoes, Dianes Favorite
Baking Potatoes, Fat-free cream cheese, * see, Skim milk, Salt, pepper, paprika, Fat-free cheddar cheese,, 
Bake potatoes in the oven as you would for a normal baked potato (NOTE: you  MUST bake them - not microwave or boil - because the radiant heat toughens  the potato skin enough to be handled).    Allow to cool, then slice tops off and carefully scrape out pulp. Reheat  pulp in micro if you want the cheeses to blend better and the filling to  reload in a prettier fashion.    Mix the pulp with 2 tablespoons of the cheddar cheese, milk and butter or  cream cheese.. Season with salt & pepper. Add paprika to taste. Spoon  potato filling back into skins, topping with reserved cheese and a sprinkle  of paprika.    Broil until cheese is bubbling and serve immediately. Or - if done in  advance and chilled, bake at 350 - 400 for 20 - 30 minutes to heat through.  I prefer baking.  NOTES : This is for one potato, so that it will be easy to adjust for as  many as you need. *Note - Original receipe called for butter. Omitting  butter and changing to fat-free products cut calories from 298 to 140, fat  from 18.9g to .1g, % of calories from fat from 56.6% to .9%. Amazing what a  few simple changes will do.
