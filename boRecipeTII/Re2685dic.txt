Hi everyone! Im finally getting around to sending the list a recipe. The  other day, a friend was at the lunch table at work who I hadnt seen there  in ages because shed been out recovering from bipass surgery. I asked what  she was reading and as usual, she was reading a mystery. This one was  called "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Crime", and there were recipes  throughout the book. One that she mentioned to me really caught my atention  so I asked her to copy it for me before she returned the book to the  library. If I remember correctly, the author is Tamar Myers. So here goes:    Cream together the butter, sugar and peanut butter. Beat in the egg. Stir  in the applesauce. Sift the remaining dry ingredients together and slowly  stir them into the batter. Mix well. Liberally grease and flour an  eight-inch-square pan. Pour the batter into the pan and bake at 350 degrees  until done (about 40 to 45 minutes.) The cake is done when a toothpick  inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool before attempting to remove  from the pan. Even better when eaten with someone you love.
