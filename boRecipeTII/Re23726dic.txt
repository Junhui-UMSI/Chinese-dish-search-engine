We got it out of Food and Wine or the Gourmet magazine around 20  years ago.    To prepare artichokes, remove the stems, cut 1/2" off of top and snip off  sharp tips of leaves and cook.  Dont over cook.  Remove chokes of  artichoke by carefully spreading leaves and pulling out innermost ones and  scrape away the fuzzy choke with a spoon. To cook shrimp, bring 1 quart  water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 teaspoons salt. Add  shrimp and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 3 to 5 minutes till  shrimp turns pink. Reserve 1/2 cup water shrimp was cooked in, then drain,  peel and clean the shrimp. Reserve 18 shrimp for garnish. Place remaining  shrimp in blender with reserved liquid, the remaining 5 tablespoons lemon  juice, seasonings and 1 cup mayonnaise. Blend until shrimp are broken up,  chill in refrigerator, where it will become considerably thicker until  ready to fill artichokes.
