Baked Deer Meat
Cube deer meat, Beef bouillon, Worcestershire Sauce, Water, Soya sauce, Salt and pepper, onion, 
Combine all the above in a casserole dish and bake at 325F for about 2  hours, stirring occasionally. Or combine in a crockpot and let cook on low  for 6-8 hours. Use the broth to make gravy if you like. The meat is tender  and not at all gamey this way.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #456 by Mindy <vinqvist@brunnet.net> on  Dec 16, 1997
