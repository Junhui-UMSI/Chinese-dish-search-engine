Walnut Onion Bread for the Abm
Vegetable oil, Walnuts, Bread flour + or -, Sugar, Onions, Milk ( or water )+ or -, Active dry yeast, Salt, 
Place ingredients in the order as instructed by manufacturer.Add more flour  or water or whatever the case to get the plaible non sticky dough  consisitency. During the last 10 minutes of the last kneading cycle ( or if  your machine beeps to indicate additions ) add the nuts and onions. I use  the regular cycle for white bread ( my machine is a toastmaster)    Note: often some breads made with walnuts will have a reddish brown  discoloration coming from the nuts.It doesnt alter the taste though.
