Dry Red Wine, Snipped chives + 2 cloves, Beef tenderloin steaks or, Clear olive oil and vinegar, Cracked multicolored or, Vegetable Kabobs, see recipe, 
For marinade, combine the salad dressing, red wine, chives, and  peppercorns. Place beef in a heavy plastic bag set in a large bowl. Pour  marinade over beef in bag; seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerate for 8-12  hours, turning meat occasionally. Remove the beef from the bag; reserve  marinade.    Grill beef on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for  22 to 26 minutes for medium doneness, turning once and brushing with  reserved marinade halfway through grilling. Discard marinade.    Arrange Vegetable Kabobs over coals during the last 10-12 minutes of  grilling and cook until browned and tender, brushing with olive oil and  salad dressing mixture. Turn occasionally. Serve kabobs with beef. Makes 4  servings.    Vegetable Kabobs: Quarter 8 tiny new potatoes. Cut 2 small red onions into  6 wedges each. Halve 1 small zucchini lengthwise and cut into 1/2 inch  thick slices. Set vegetables aside. Cook potatoes in a small amount of  boiling water in a medium covered saucepan for 10 minutes. Gently stir in  the onion wedges, 8 baby yellow sunburst squash, and 4 miniature sweet  peppers or 1 medium red sweet pepper quartered. Cover and cook for 5-8  minutes or until vegetables are nearly tender. Drain; cool slightly.    Alternately skewer the precooked vegetables and uncooked zucchini onto  eight       10    inch skewers.    Combine 1/4 cup clear olive oil and vinegar salad dressing and 2 teaspoons  snipped fresh rosemary in a small bowl. Brush mixture over kaboabs.    NOTES : I would grill these slightly to make them LOOK grilled but the  recipe doesnt say to do this.
