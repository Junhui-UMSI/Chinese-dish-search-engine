Tapenade Verte (Green Olive Spread)
green salad olives, Shallot, Black Pepper, chives, Fresh Lemon Juice, olive oil, 
In a food processor or small mixer, combine olives, shallot, lemon juice,  pepper and half of the olive oil.  Add anchovies if desired.    Pulse until mixture is a course paste consistency.  Use more oil if  necessary.  I like to vary the coarseness according to what I am going to  serve.  A coarser consistency is good for vegetable crudites (a basket of  green onions, fennel slices, cherry tomatoes).  A smoother tapenade is good  spread on thin slices of baguette, toasted, or thicker chunks of sourdough  bread.  For a smoother tapenade, use all of the olive oil and blend until  creamy and smooth.  Top with a sprinkling of chives and serve.
