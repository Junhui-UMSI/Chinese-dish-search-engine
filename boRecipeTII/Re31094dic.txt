SHutt@aol.com    Recipe By: Miami Spice by Steven Rraichlen    Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl, and gently toss to mix. Correct  seasonings, adding  salt, lime juice, or sugar to taste.  The salsa should  be a little sweet and a little sour. Banana salsa tastes best when served a  couple of hours after making.  Refrigerate,covered, until serving time.    Serving Ideas: serve with grilled chicken, duck or shrimp.    NOTES: I am serving it with baked fish; I left out the cardamom; I also  used 1/2 of a hab instead of jalapeno.
