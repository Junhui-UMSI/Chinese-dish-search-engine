Favorite Mandelbrot
Orange juice, Flour, Baking Powder, Salt, Ground almonds, Eggs, Sugar, Vegetable oil, 
Our favorite cookies...I usually mix a few mini chocolate chips into one of  the loaves for the kids. OR:You can mix in 1/4 cup dried candied fruit, if  you wish. My husband likes to dunk these in his coffee.    Beat the eggs. Add sugar, 1/2 cup oil & orange juice. Mix well. Combine dry  ingredients, add to egg mixture & mix well. Oil your hands & shape 3  loaves. Place on 2 sprayed cookie sheets. Bake 40 minutes. Cut diagonal  slices while still warm & leave to cool.
