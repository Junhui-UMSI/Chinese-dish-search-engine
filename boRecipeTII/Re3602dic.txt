Brought this to the department picnic, one regular, one habd.  Very good  stuff.  Adapted from NIkki and David Goldbecks American Wholefood Cuisine.    In mixing bowl, beat eggs and habanero powder with fork.  Add honey, syrup,  vanilla, salt, beat some more.  Add butter and pecans, beat a little more.  Pour into pie crust, bake at 400 for 10 minutes, then 350 for about 25  minutes until set. Cool.    Good with Cool Whip (Im a non-dairy person).  The heat is slow - one woman  tried it and said this isnt hot... oooooh.... I think Ill get some more  soda!  Just a nice slow burn.  Use two tsp habanero for a bigger kick.  Garnish top of pie with fresh habs for nice look and also visual warning.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #134    Date: Fri, 18 Oct 1996 23:31:01 -0400    From: Naughyde@aol.com
