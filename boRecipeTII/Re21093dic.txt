* (Tobler(R), Lindt(R), or Nestles(R))     The ultimate indulgence!     Use the middle rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 425?. Butter bottom and  sides of two 13 x 9 x 2-inch aluminum pans, and dust lightly with flour.     For brownies, melt chocolate, butter and coffee on top of a double-boiler.  Blend until smooth.     In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs, salt, sugar and extracts  until light in color and creamy. Add melted chocolate to creamed mixture,  then mix in the flour and fold in walnut pieces.     Pour batter evenly into pans. Reduce oven to 375? and bake for 30 minutes.  Test for doneness with a toothpick (center will come out clean and dry).  Remove from oven and refrigerate immediately to cool.     To make icing: in the top of a double-boiler, add white chocolate, chopped  in pieces, sugar and cream. Heat until smooth; sugar should be completely  melted. Pour over cooled brownies. Sprinkle walnuts on top. Return to  refrigerator for chocolate to set.     Serve at room temperature, or freeze in trays, or serve individually by  wrapping in saran wrap and foil.    Yield: 48.
