"Crispy, sugar-dusted wonton wrappers cache a sweet chewy filling of fruit  and nuts, adding a perfect touch to the end of the meal." For filling, in a  medium bowl toss together pears, apples, cherries and lemon juice. In a  large skillet cook fruit mixture in 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat 7  minutes. Reduce heat. Stir in Marsala, nuts, cinnamon and ginger. Cook 3  minutes or until liquid has disappeared stirring often. Stir in syrup; set  aside. For each wonton spoon 2 teaspoons filling into the center of a  wrapper. Lightly moistened edges of wrapper with water. Fold top edge of  wrapper over filling to opposite edge making half-moon. Press edges  together to seal. Arrange wontons on a greased baking sheet. Brush with the  melted butter. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. Bake at 350F 12-15 minutes or  until golden. Cool slightly. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Makes 36  wontons. Better Homes and Gardens, "Good things in small packages", January  1998.    Recipe by: Better Homes and Gardens, January 1998, Page 132.
