submitted by: thereseM@qimr.edu.au  Submitted by Therese Murphy from Brisbane, Australia.  The following are  recipes with an Indian/Malay background.    Fry sliced onion in oil till golden brown. Add spices with a little water.  Stir fry for about 5 minutes. Add tomato juice and salt, 2 1/4 cups water  and the rice. Turn up heat for a minute, then turn down and keep dish  covered. When all the water has been absorbed, turn off heat, and leave  covered for another 10 minutes to complete cooking. For best results, add 1  Tbsp butter or margarine and gently stir and fluff up with a fork. Please  note that this dish may also be cooked in a rice cooker, after the initial  stage.
