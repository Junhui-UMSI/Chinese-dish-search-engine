Transfer to a large bowl.    In small pot over very low heat, combine orange juice with gelatin. Heat,  stirring frequently, until all gelatin dissolves, about 2 minutes. Slowly  whisk gelatin mixture into strawberry puree.    With mixer at high speed, beat cream until soft peaks form. Fold 1/4 of  whipped cream into strawberry mixture until well conbined., Gently fold in  remaining whipped cream. Line 5 cup bowl or mold with plastic wrap. Pour in  mousse. Chill until firm, about 2 hours.    To unmold, invert onto serving platter. Gently pull mold away from plastic  wrap. Peel off wrap. Smooth sides of mousse, if necessary, with small warm  knife or metal spatula. Garnish mousse with whipped cream, strawberries and  mint, if desired.  Ready to serve in 2 hours 20 minutes.    Tips: To make the cream extra fluffy, chill the cream, mixing bowl and  beaters for at least 3 hours before beating.    Make sure that the orange juice mixture and strawberry puree is at about  the same temperature, so it will combine more easily; (no lumps). SLOWLY  whisk juice mixture into puree.
