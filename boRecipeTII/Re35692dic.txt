1. Cut top off each pepper and remove seeds and veins. Blanch in boiling  water for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and let cool. 2. In a skillet, heat oil,  add onion and garlic and saute for 4 to 5 minutes. 3. Add meat, salt,  pepper and thyme and cook until meat is browned. 4. In a large mixing bowl,  combine the meat, tomatoes, rice and parsley. 5. Stuff each pepper with the  meat mixture, place top back on each and bake in a preheated 325 degree F.  oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  *You may use yellow or red peppers as a substitute for eye appeal. One of  my favorite serving tricks to use green, red, yellow peppers in this  preparation. Then, use a large, well garnished platter for the cooked  peppers. If you use a creole type suace, the affect is truely spectacular.  **I have from time to time cut the peppers in half lenghtwise in order to  add plate coverage. This is especially important if the peppers are small.  It gives the appearence of quantity with out the bulk. When I do this I  increase the cooked rice to 1 1/2 cups. Your mileage may vary!
