By Linda West Eckhardt and Diana Collingwood Butts    *NOTE:  Original recipe used 2 T vegetable oil    If you dont have polenta you can use the same amounts of cornmeal.  The  directions are for the dough setting, although this bread can be made and  baked in a 1 lb machine. (Alas, the flavor will not be the same.)  Serve  the loaf warm.    Add all the ingredients to the bread machine pan.  Process on the dough  setting.  Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet or place a piece of  parchment paper on a peel.    Remove the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for a few seconds  to remove any remaining air bubbles.  Shape into a ball and flatten  slightly with the palm of your hand.  Place on the prepared baking sheet or  peel.   Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and  set aside to rise in a wram draft-free area until doubled in bulk, about 1  hour.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 deg F, inserting a baking stone  or tiles if you are not using a baking sheet.    When the dough has doubled in bulk, score the top with a sharp knife or  razor blade held at a 45 deg angle to the bread.  Bake for 30 minutes, or  until medium brown, on the middle rack of the preheated oven on the baking  stone or tiles.  Transfer from the baking sheet or stone to cool on a rack.  Store wrapped in a plastic bag.    Dough setting    Excellent!!  Absolutely incredible flavor and texture.
