It  originally called for low fat cheese, I substituted fat free cheese here,  although I used a rice cheese on mine. It would probably be fine without  the cheese too.    "Saute" the onion, pepper, garlic, tomatoes, picante and cumin until  lightly cooked. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Stir in beans.    In a 13 x 9 x 2  pan:  Spread 1/3 of the bean mixture over bottom. Top with  1/2 the tortillas, overlap as necessary and 1/2 the cheese.  Add another  1/3 of bean mixture, then remaining tortillas and bean mixture. Cover and  bake at 350 (I baked uncovered by accident..it turned out fine) for 30-35  minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Top with tomatoes, lettuce, ff  sour cream if desired. Makes six servings.    fatfree digest V96 #215    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
