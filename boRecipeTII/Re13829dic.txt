Boil syrup & dry malt extract with 3-5 gallons of water for 1 hr, adding  hops and cinnamon to the boil for the indicated times. Cool and place in a  sanitized container, adding the prepared (swollen) liquid yeast pack to the  wort at a temperature of no more than 85 degrees F.    Hold at 65 to 85 degrees until fermentation begins, then drop the temp to  60-70 for 7 days.  After 7 days, place the thawed fruit in a sanitized  secondary fermenter and siphon the beer on top.    Again, hold at 60-75 degrees for 7 days. After 7 days, check with a  hydrometer to be sure the finishing gravity has been reached or exceeded  AND the gravity has stopped dropping.  Once the gravity checks have beeb  completed, siphon beer into priming tank, mix in corn sugar, and bottle. It  is vital to make sure that the gravity has stopped dropping before  bottling, as beer that is still fermenting coould cause bottles to explode  after capping.    Age beer for 3 weeks at 55-65 before refrigerating and drinking. Starting  gravity: 1.044 Finishing Gravity: 1.010 or less    Recipe By     : Williams    From:                                 Date: 05/29    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
