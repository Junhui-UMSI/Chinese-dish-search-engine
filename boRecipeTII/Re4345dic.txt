Persimmon Habanero Salsa
Habanero, seeded and cut up, Quatre Epices, (4-Spice, Khaki persimmon, (Asian not, Garlic clove, peeled and cut, 
Scrape the flesh of the persimmon off the skin and into a food processor;  add the Habanero, the garlic and the Quatre Epices. Pulse till smooth. * If  you cant find Quatre Epices in a specialty food store, you can make your  own. In France its much used in charcouterie, but I like it a lot in prune  butter, pumpkin pie and apple crisp. Larousse Gastronomique gives the  following formula, but I think the one I buy here in Phila at Assouline &  Ting has less pepper. Quatre Epices 1 1/8 Cup ground white pepper 1 1/2 Tbs  ground or powdered cloves 3 1/2 Tbs ground ginger 4 Tbs ground nutmeg  Combine the spices really well...you could even use a hand mixer, and store  in a closed jar    NOTES : If you cook this, it gets very thick, loses some of the terrific  persimmon color and some heat, but it isnt bad         sauteed briefly.  Store in a closed jar in the refrigerator    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #309 by Walt Gray <waltgray@mnsinc.com> on  Apr 29, 1997
