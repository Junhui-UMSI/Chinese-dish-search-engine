Yorkshire Pork Chops
olive oil, Pork loin chops - 1-1/2 to 2, Eggs, milk, Butter, Salt, Flour, Lg golden delicious apple, 
(Serve with warm applesauce.. OPTIONAL) Peel and slice the apple into 4  thick rings.  Melt the oil in an oven-proof pan, and brown them for about 1  minute on each side. Put an apple ring on each chop. Whisk the milk, eggs,  flour butter and salt until well mixed. Pour the batter over the chops and  bake for about 35 minutes at 450~ or until the batter is browned and puffy.  Serve immediately - with the warm applesauce. Since the Yorkshire batter  bakes with the pork chops, it swells up and around the chops and becomes  crisp on top, but stays soft and moist inside - like you think of yorkshire  pudding.  If you use thin chops they will tend to become dry and tough, so  best use thick ones for this recipe.                                                Carole
