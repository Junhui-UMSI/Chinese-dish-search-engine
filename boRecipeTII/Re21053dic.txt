milk, Paprika (Optional), Cheddar cheese, Green Onions, Butter or margarine, Med. Baking Potatoes, 
Scrub baking potatoes with a brush.  Prick with a fork in several places.  Place potatoes in a shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100%  power for 6 to 8 minutes or till potatoes are tender.  Cut a lengthwise  slice from the top of each potato.  Discard the skin from the lengthwise  slices, place the potato portions from the lengthwise slices in a mixing  bowl.  Scoop out the insides of the potatoes leaving two 1/4-inch thick  shells; reserve the shells.  Add the insides of the potatoes to the mixing  bowl containing the potato portions from the top slices; mash.  Stir in  shredded cheddar cheese, butter or margarine and sliced green onion.  Beat  in enough milk to give the mixture a stiff consistency.  Season to taste  with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Pile the mashed potato mixture into  the reserved potato shells.  Return to the shallow baking dish.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power for 2 to 3 minutes or till potato  mixture is heated through.  Sprinkle with paprika, if desired.
