Chicken boullion, Dark brown sugar, chicken broth, Plain yogurt, boneless chicken, Dijon mustard, Raw long-grain wild rice, Hot water, Honey, Soy sauce, 
Here is a recipe from Lora Brodys "The Kitchen Survival Guide."    Heat oven to 375F. with rack in center position. Spray a 2-quart casserole  with non-stick vegetable cooking spray or coat it lightly with vegetable  shortening. Pour rice over botton of prepared dish, then pour in broth.  Rinse chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Layer the chicken over the  rice.    Combine remaining ingredients, mix well, and spread over the chicken. Cover  loosely with foil and bake 40-50 minutes. Remove the foil and continue  baking 10 minutes, or until chicken is done. Makes 6 servings.    NOTE: Test chicken for doneness by pricking with fork; juices should run  clear. Or slice into thickest part with a small sharp knife to make sure  there is no pinkness in the meat. If liquid is not absorbed, let sit 5-10  before serving.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #266      Date: Sat, 28 Sep 1996 07:10:05 -0500      From: netdir@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)
