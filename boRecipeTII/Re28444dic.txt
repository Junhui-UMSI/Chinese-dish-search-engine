Baked Oatmeal
Baking Powder, Raisins; Seedless,, Vanilla extract, Eggs****, Oats; Rolled (Raw), Milk; Rice, Soy Or Dairy ***, Salt, Honey, Cinnamon, 
Mix together and pour into an ungreased 9 x 13 baking pan.    Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until golden brown.    This re-heats well. You can assemble ahead (even overnight) and bake later.    ENJOY!!!    NOTES : ***** I use Rice Dream, or Vitasoy milk instead of dairy.    ***** I sometimes substitute flax seed mixture for one or more of the eggs.  The result is the same taste but a slightly softer texture.    Flax seed mixture: Place in blender: 1/2 cup whole organic flax seeds.  Blend until a fine meal. Add 1 1/2 cup cold water and blend 2-3 minutes  until thickened and has consistency of eggs. Use 1/4 cup flax seed mixture  to replace one egg in baking.    To make it a little extra special, try pouring half of the batter in the  pan, then placing fresh, sliced fruit over top. We use bananas, kiwi,  apples and others. Now, pour the remaining batter over the fruit and spread  evenly to cover. Bake as directed    Recipe by: HOMEHEARTH MAILING LIST 1998    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 553 by ctlindab@mail1.nai.net on  Jan 18, 1998
