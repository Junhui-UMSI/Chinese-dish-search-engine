Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly in a medium  bowl. Cut the butter and shortening into small pieces and add them to the  flour mixture. Blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal.    2. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients and pour in the beer. Stir  just until mixture is evenly moistened, then turn out onto a lightly  floured surface.    3. Knead just until the dough comes together, about 30 seconds. Pat out  dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out biscuits with a 2 1/2-inch round  cutter dipped in flour. Wiggle rather than twist cutter to loosen the  biscuits.    4. Lift away the trimmings and transfer the biscuits to an ungreased baking  sheet. Gently press the trimmings together, overlapping them slightly, and  roll the dough out again. Cut additional biscuits and discard any  trimmings.    5. Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve hot.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
