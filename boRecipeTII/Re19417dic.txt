Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl and pour in enough boiling water to  cover. Push any floating mushrooms to the bottom. Allow to soak for 5  minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and cut into small pieces.  Discard the stems. The white mushrooms should be halved.  Heat 2  tablespoons oil in a large, heavy, nonreactive casserole over medium heat.  Stir in the garlic and saute for 10 seconds. Then add the tomatoes and cook  1 minute over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons water, the dried mushrooms that  soaked and the herbs. Stir and bring to a slow boil. Add the baby onions,  white mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Stir the mixture and  return to a boil. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes  or until mushrooms are tender. Gently mix in the beans and heat through on  low heat. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Heat the broiler. Spoon the  mixture into a 9 or 10-cup casserole. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs. You  may also sprinkle with 1 tablespoon oil. Broil about 1 minute or until the  crumbs brown.   WATCH CAREFULLY SO THIS DOES NOT BURN.
