Sweet Yeast Cookies
Sugar, Salt, Flour, Eggs, Yeast, Vegetable oil, Water (up to 2), 
Here is a recipe that runs in my family for generations.  We make it for  the "Azkara" feast which takes place in a synagogue.    Here in Israel you need to take a "hafrashat hala" out of the dough in case  you want it to be kosher. Also I am not certain whether this cookie is  "bore minei mezonot" or "hamotsi lechem". Check with youre rabbi.    1. put the yeast in a glass with 1/2 cup warm water and 2 tablespoons of  sugar for 5 to 10 min.    2. put the flour in a big bowl, add  the dry ingredients and mix.  add the  yeast, half of the oil and mix for 2 min.  add the eggs one at a time and  mix for 2 min. add the rest off the water and mix for 2 min. add rest off  the oil and mix for 2 min. at this stage you should get a smooth dough.    3.  cover the dough with plastic bag and over it a towel. put aside for 1  to      1.5    hours till dough is doubled.    4. make a long sausage out of the Dough and cut 3.5 cm. balls out of it.    5. roll the balls into 1.5 cm. wide - 15 cm. long strips. connect the  strips ends to form loops. if you want to get bright brown cookies glaze  loops with egg yoke.    6. bake in medium heat for 40 min. till golden brown (yokes deep brown).    about 45 cookies    this cookies are very tasty in there simple way and dont take a lot of  effort to make.  have a nice "Kinnus"  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #84    Date: Sat, 23 Nov 1996 21:41:11 +0200    From: Eyal Edelman via Shmulik Fishman <fms@actcom.co.il>
