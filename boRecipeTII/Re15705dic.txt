Stir in the Adobo de Achiote a bit at a time until everything is  beautifully oarange and the achiote is necely detectable; you may need to  season the dressing with more salt. Drizzle over the tometoes, then  sprinkle with thinly sliced green onions or sliced green-tops-on-white  onion. Strew with chopped herbs (anything from cilantro to chervil will be  welcom), and youre ready to serve    Recipe by: Simple Ideas from my American Home    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #914 by "Karrie Brothers"  <K_Brothers@classic.msn.com> on Nov 18, 97
