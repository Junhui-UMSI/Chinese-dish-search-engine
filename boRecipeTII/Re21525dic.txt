Apple Pie Filling
Dozen cloves, Apples, Water, Butter, Juice and grated rind of 1, Sugar, 
Laura Steele    This is a very standard apple pie filling that could come from anywhere in  America.  Pare, core, and quarter the apples. Boil the cores and parings in sugar and  water; strain off the liquor, adding more sugar; put the lemon rind over  the apples and the juice into the syrup. Mix cloves with the fruit; put in  a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Turn the fruit into a pastry-lined  pie shell. Add a small quantity of juice. Top the pie and add more juice  later if desired. Bake in a 450? oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350?  and bake for 3/4 to 1 hour or until done.
