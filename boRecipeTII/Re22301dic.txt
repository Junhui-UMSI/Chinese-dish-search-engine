This  is tedious work, but the improved flavor is a reward. They taste great  unpeeled too, so dont be guilted into peeling if you are impatient (hows  that for guilting?).    While peeling the nuts, bring 2-3 quarts of water to a boil and put in  noodles.    If nuts are peeled, pat dry with a towel.  Heat oil in a skillet, add  garlic and when golden, remove and discard. Add walnuts and fry over medium  heat until just golden - do not burn them. Remove and set aside. Add meat  to oil and toss while cooking until just done but still very tender, add  scallions and parsley, stir until wilted, return walnuts, and remove from  electric burner or turn off gas.    Drain noodles, cover with mixture from skillet.  This is also excellent  with chicken of course, or even a firm fish that will not fall into flakes.
