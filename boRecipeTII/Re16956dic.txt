Toast nuts in a 350F oven, about 8 to 10 minutes, until aromatic. Be  careful not to scorch. (Cut a few nuts open and check that the centers are  lightly browned but not dark.) Chop nuts coarsely. Reduce oven temperature  to 325F. Lightly spray-grease a large cooking sheet.    In a large mixer bowl, beat together oil, sugar and eggs. Sift flour,  baking powder and salt together. Add dry ingredients, anise seed and  almonds to mixer and mix until dough pulls together. Divide dough into 2  equal parts. Spread each portion of dough into a strip about 3- X 12-inches  long. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Carefully remove each cookie  strip to a cutting board and cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices. Turn each  slice onto its side and return to baking sheet. Return to oven and bake  another 15 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on a rack. Makes 3-1/2 dozen  cookies.    CopyrightA9 1996, Jane A. Rubey, M.P.H., R.D.
