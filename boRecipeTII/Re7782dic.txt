Portobello "Risotto"
Saffron (optional), Orzo, uncooked, Portobello mushrooms, Stock (I used, Garlic, minced, Other mushrooms such as, Onion, Salt, pepper to taste, Fatfree Parmesan (optional), 
Boil stock and saffron in large sauce pan. When boiling, add dry Orzo and  let cook until done, about 20 minutes.    Meanwhile, saute garlic and onion in a large, sprayed pan. When onions are  translucent, add all mushrooms and cook until soft. Season with salt and  pepper to taste.    Drain Orzo, but not thoroughly--reserve some (1/4 cup) of the liquid.  Combine Orzo with sauteed vegetables. Spread in a 9" x 13" baking pan,  sprayed with cooking spray if desired. Top with a sprinkle of Parmesan and  fresh black pepper. Bake uncovered at 325 F for 20 minutes.    Note: this recipe doesnt use much seasoning. If you use a flavorful enough  stock, the Orzo absorbs excellently and the dish will have a nice, rich  flavor.
