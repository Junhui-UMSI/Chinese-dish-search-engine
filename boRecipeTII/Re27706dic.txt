The Kaplans Better Than Butter
Water, ButterBuds natural butter, Nonfat dry milk, Lowfat (1-2% milkfat), 
Its easy. Just pour all of above into your blender. Blend on low and  increase speed until smooth. Then pour/scrape mixture back into cheese  container and refrigerate.    Youll never taste the cottage cheese. I use 2 packs of Sweet n Low.  Experiment until you love the taste. With just 7 calories per tablespoon  and an almost unmeasurable trace of artery clogging fat and cholesterol,  youll never want to use cholesterol laden 100 calorie butter or 100  calorie margarine on your bread again.
