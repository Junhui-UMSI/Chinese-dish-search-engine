Place 4 slices of bread, with crusts removed, into greased 8" X 8" X 2"  pan. Put slice of cheese on each piece of bread, then place asparagus  evenly on top of cheese. Top each with another slice of bread. Mix egg,  milk, salt, pepper, and mustard and pour over bread. Let refrigerate  overnight. Sprinkle top with additional grated cheese and bake at 350  degrees for 45-50 minutes or until custard is set (knife comes out clean  when inserte).    As a variation, use ham slices instead of asparagus and top with corn  flakes and 4T melted butter.    Mrs. Harold T.
