Ann Smith of Plainfield won second place, and described how her gingerbread  men left Bohemia in 1872 and immigrated to the United States. Smiths  great-grandmother, "Babicka" Novak, lived in a small Czech-American town in  South Dakota where Smiths mother grew up in the 1920s. At Christmas time,  her great-grandma would give her neighbors Old World gingerbread men,  reindeer and rocking horses.    "One year when Great-grandma delivered the cookies, she brought along her  teenaged grandson, who was visiting from a small ethnic Czech community in  Nebraska," Smith wrote.    "Introductions made that day over the watchful eyes of the gingerbread  men eventually lead to wedding bells for my parents a decade later.  Great-grandma Novak probably had planned this all along!" from the Chicago  Tribune second annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 14, 1989  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 01:07:01 +0000
