Barbara Mihalevich Arciero, Food Writer, "The Times", Shreveport,  Louisiana.    "When I was a student at the University of Missouri, I spent a semester  working in a preschool. Thats where I discovered Aggression Cookies, a  not-so-unique cookie with a unique name. These cookies, I discovered, offer  a socially acceptable way for youngsters to let off steam and to make a  tasty snack at the same time. The dough is stiff, so children can mash,  knead, squeeze and pound it to their hearts content without inflicting any  damage. Children dont need to know the name of these cookies; just tell  them youve got a special cookie for them to make."    Combine brown sugar, butter, oats, baking soda and flour in a large mixing  bowl. Mash, knead, squeeze and pound ingredients to make a dough.    Form dough into small balls. Put balls on ungreased baking sheets. Grease  the bottom of a small glass or jar; dip into granulated sugar and use to  flatten balls.    Bake in a preheated 350 deg oven about 15 minutes or until done. Transfer  to racks to cool. Makes about 7 dozen cookies.
