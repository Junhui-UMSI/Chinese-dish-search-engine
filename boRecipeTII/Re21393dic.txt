Saute the onion, carrot, celery and garlic in a 4-1/2-quart saucepan or  Dutch oven, over medium-high heat, for 10 minutes.    2. Add the remaining ingredients, mix well, and bring the mixture to a  boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer  the mixture for 30 to 35 minutes. Do not stir or lift the lid until the  total cooking time has elapsed.    3. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture rest, covered, for        5    minutes.    4. Stir to mix well and serve hot.    Yield: 4 servings    NOTE: This recipe must be made with QUICK-COOKING brown rice. Do not  substitute regular brown rice. The acid in the tomato-based sauce prevents  regular brown rice from absorbing sufficient moisture to thoroughly soften  and cook.
