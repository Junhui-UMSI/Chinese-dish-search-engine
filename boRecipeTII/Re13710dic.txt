Wild Rice Casserole
Canned mushrooms, Butter, Slivered almonds, Chicken broth, Chives or green onions, Wild rice; washed, 
Notes: By Gov. Arne H. Carlson, Minnesota    Before the rice is cooked, it should be washed in cold water four or five  times and any chaff or other seeds should be discarded.    Put all ingredients except the broth in a heavy frypan. Cook, stirring  constantly, until rice turns yellow. Place in a casserole and add broth.  Cover tightly and bake at 325? for 1 hour. Serves 6. Luxurious wild rice  was the staple food of the Indians of the northern lake country of  Minnesota and Canada. One of the world?s rare flavors, it costs little to  serve. An ounce of dry rice cooks up to a generous serving that lends an  aristocratic touch to any meal. It is served often at the Minnesota  Governor?s residence.
