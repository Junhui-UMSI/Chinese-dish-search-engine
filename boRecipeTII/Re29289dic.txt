Scrub the potatoes and bake them in a 400 F. oven for 1 hour or until done.    While the potatoes are baking, prepare the filling. Saute the onions and  carrots in the oil until they are tender, for about 10 minutes. Add the  bell pepper and spices and continue to saute for another minute or two,  stirring. Add a little water to the pan to prevent sticking, cover it, and  cook for another 5 minutes, or until the bell pepper is just tender. Stir  in the cream cheese and add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.    When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, make a lengthwise cut in the  top of each one and scoop out at least half of the contents. If you are  using large potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise and scoop them out,  leaving about 1/2 inch of potato clining to the skin. Mash the scooped-out  potato and then add it to the vegetable-cream cheese mixture. Lower the  oven heat to 350 F. Fill the potato shells with this mixture and place them  in an oiled baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.    Serve topped with Spicy Yogurt Sauce. Baked Stuffed Potatoes served with  Dal and your favorite chutney make a complete meal. Note: this dish can be  prepared ahead. After stuffing the potatoes, wrap them well and refrigerate  for up to two days. When ready to serve, bake them in a 350 F. oven for  about 45 minutes.
