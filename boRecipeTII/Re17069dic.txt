* Note: Honest, the recipe was like this when I formatted it! I think its  supposed to be "PARSNIP roots". (K.M.)    QUARTER CARROT LENGTHWISE, trim and discard top 2 inches of celery and  quarter remaining head. Remove green part of leeks. Slice turnip into  3/8-inch slabs. Place vegetables, garlic and coriander in a saucepan large  enough to handle them comfortably and add water and salt. Cover, place over  high heat. Cook until vegetables are soft and remove each from the water as  they are done. Place vegetables to drain on towels and place in the  refrigerator to chill. Add vinegar to the liquid in the saucepan and boil  the liquid until reduced by 2/3. Remove from the heat and pour the liquid  into a mixing bowl. When the liquid is cool, add the dill and vigorously  beat in the oil. Arrange the vegetables on a platter, pour the sauce over  them and serve.
