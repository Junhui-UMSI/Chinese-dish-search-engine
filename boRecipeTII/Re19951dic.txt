Apple Butter
Vinegar, Thick Apple Pulp, Cinnamon, Sugar, 
1. Core and slice apples, leaving the peelings on.    2. Place in kettle, covering with water.    3. Cook until apples are soft.    4. Put apples in blender, high speed, or press through sieve to make a fine  pulp.    5. Measure 16 cups.    6. Combine pulp with remaining ingredients.    7. Bake at 250 degrees in a porcelain roaster, stirring occasionally with a  wooden spoon to keep from sticking to the sides.    8. Cook for about 1 1/2 hours.    9. To test for doneness, remove a small amount of the butter from the oven  and allow to cool.    10. If the butter remains smooth, take the roaster from the oven.    11. Pour into sterilized jars and seal while hot.    Recipe by: diane@keyway.net    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 199 by "Diane Geary"  <diane@keyway.net> on Nov 4, 1997
