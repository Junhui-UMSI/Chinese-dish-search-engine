SETTING: White Bread / MANUAL    The pleasant blend of whole wheat and bananas will fascinate the  bagel-fancier and provide a base for many toppings.    After the machine has completed  the second rising, it  will beep.  Remove  the dough and divide into 4 parts. Divide each fourth into 3 pieces. Shape  each piece into a smooth ball. Punch a hole in the center with a finger and  gently pull dough to make a one or two-inch hole.    In a 3-quart saucepan, combine 2 quarts water and 2 tablespoons sugar; heat  to boiling. Place a few bagels at a time in boiling water. Simmer 3  minutes, turning once. Remove with slotted spoon. Place on greased cookie  sheet. Brush tops with 1 egg white slightly beaten; sprinkle with poppy or  sesame seeds. Bake 375 degrees for 20 minutes.    >From: Rick Turley <rickt@hpfccg.sde.hp.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Welbilt/Red Star Yeast
