Wonderful Pesto Bread
Salt; up to 1 tsp, olive oil, Egg, Milk; whole or skim, Basil; or favorite pesto, Active dry yeast, All-purpose flour, 
Load ingredients into machine, per manufacturers instructions.  Use Quick  bake cycle.    The bread is wonderful.  Simply use your favorite pesto recipe.  The bread  is beautiful green tint, as well.  It browns some, when cooking, but the  hint of green still remains.  Suggestions would be to add ground walnuts or  pine nuts.  The bread is a compact one.  Works well for either the 1 pound  or 1 1/2 pound machines.  No machine--I still suggest making this one by  hand.  Simply add additional flour, as needed.  I also seem to remember, I  increased the pesto to 4 tablespoons.  But I do like flavor.    >From: Katie E Green <kgreen@u.washington.edu>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
