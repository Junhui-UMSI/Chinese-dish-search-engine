Judy et al., heres the translation of the original Spanish recipe I have  for Tacos Al Pastor...This recipe assumes you dont have a "trompo", so it  is not the real deal, but as close as one can get.    Preparation:    1. Clean the peppers and simmer them in the vinegar until they are soft.  Add remaining ingredients and puree. If it is too thick, add some more  vinegar.    2. Return to stove and bring to a boil, stirring continuosly so as not to  burn it. When it reaches boiling point, remove from heat and allow to cool.    3. Spread adobo over each of the pork slices, layering the pieces on top of  each other forming a neat pile. Cover and let sit for at least 5 hours in  refrigerator.    4. Add a little bit of oil to a hot pan/skillet, and sear each piece of  meat on both sides. When done searing all the meat, chop it into small  (1/8") pieces and return to skillet, this time adding the onion and the  pineapple pieces or juice. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes, the  wonderful smell will let you know when it is done!    Goes great with home-made corn tortillas.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #241 by "Luis K.
