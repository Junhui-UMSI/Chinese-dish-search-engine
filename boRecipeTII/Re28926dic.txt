To make cilantro paste, puree all ingredients in a mortar and pestle, or  blender, until a fine paste is formed. You can also do this by hand by  first chopping all ingredients, except fish sauce, together on a board to  form a paste. Then mix with fish sauce in a small bowl. Set aside. Follow  directions on packages for reconstituting cellophane noodles and dried  mushrooms, if necessary. Noodles usually need to soak in warm water for  about 15 minutes; mushrooms about 30 minutes. While ingredients are  soaking, make dumplings by combining ground pork, fish sauce, garlic, and  cornstarch in a bowl. With your hands, form small meatballs, about the size  of hazelnuts. Set aside. When noodles and mushrooms are finished soaking,  drain. Remove and discard the tough stems and slice mushrooms into julienne  strips. Cut noodles into 2 by 3inch lengths. Place all ingredients near  stove and bring chicken stock to a boil in a large stockpot. Reduce heat to  a simmer and add pork balls, mushrooms, and noodles. Cook, uncovered, until  pork is done, about 10 minutes. Stir in paste and adjust seasonings with  pepper and fish sauce. Ladle into serving bowls, sprinkle with sliced  scallions and cilantro leaves, and serve immediately.
