Carols Baked Chicken
Medium onion, Carrots, Squash (Yellow or green), salt and pepper, Small 3 lb chicken (whole), Large red or white potato, 
Ok, simple as it is, what to do if you are out of stuffing or time?    Simple.  Start oven at 400 degrees, and unwrap a defrosted chicken. Remove  the gizzards and save for something else.  Now chop up in large pieces, all  those veggies.  Got a big pot?  Put these at the bottom ans put the chicken  on top. If it doesnt all fit, put some of the veggies inside the chicken.  Best trick is lift chicken on a small metal rack or on a tuna/catfood can  that has been emptied and washed out with holes poked at the top.    Optional: other veggies are fine.  I use green beans, whole pea pods, and  leeks at times.    Fat savings:  Remove the skin and cover the pot.  May desire to add a can  of tomato soup or paste to prevent drying.    Serve with:  Baking soda cheese bread and plump green and black olives. For  dessert, consider something lite such as a delicate sugar free mocha coffee  or apple cinnimon herbal tea.
