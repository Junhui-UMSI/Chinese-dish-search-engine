This was published in the July 29, 1998 issue of the Los Angeles Times in  an article called, "Quick Fix" by Janet McCracken. She suggests that  arugula and fresh spinach are good mixed with other greens in this salad.    1. Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste (add salt carefully because  olives and capers will add saltiness).    2. Heat large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. When oil is  hot and smoky, add chicken and saute until cooked through and juices run  clear when pricked with fork, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet  and set aside.    3. Add tomatoes with juice to skillet. Add garlic and simmer 5 minutes. Add  capers, olives and oregano and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Taste  and adjust seasoning.    4. Add reserved chicken and toss to coat with sauce. Let sit 5 minutes,  stirring occasionally to release steam, until cooled slightly.    5. Put greens in large bowl and toss with chicken mixture.
