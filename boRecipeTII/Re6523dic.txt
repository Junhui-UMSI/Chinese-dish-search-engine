Poached Halibut in Warm Herb Vinaigrette
Chopped fresh italian, Vinaigrette; recipe follows, Freshly ground white pepper, Chopped fresh chives, Chopped fresh tarragon, Eight ounce halibut steaks;, Court bouillon; recipe, Chopped fresh chervil, Shallot; peeled and finely, Dijon mustard, Fine sea salt to taste, 
Place the mustard in a bowl and whisk in the vinaigrette. Whisk in the  shallot, place the mixture in a small saucepan and set aside.    Bring the court bouillon to a boil in a 10-inch wide pot. Season the  halibut with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the halibut to the pot and  adjust the heat so the liquid just simmers. Poach until a metal skewer  inserted into the center of the halibut meets only a little resistance and  the skewer, when left in the fish for 5 seconds, feels barely warm when  touched to your lip, about 5 to 6 minutes. The halibut will be rare, the  thinner the steaks, the sooner they will be ready. Take the steaks out of  the liquid as soon as they are done.    Add the herbs to the vinaigrette and warm over low heat. Pull the skin off  the halibut and place in the center of 4 plates. Spoon the vinaigrette over  and around the fish. Serve immediately.
