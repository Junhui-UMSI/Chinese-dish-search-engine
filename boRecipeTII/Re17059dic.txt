*  Beet should be washed and dried.    If you are using a fresh beet, preheat the oven to 375 Degrees F. Wrap the  beet in aluminum foil and bake until tender, about 1 1/4 hours. When the  beet is cool enough to handle, peel it and cut into 1/2-inch dice.  Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 10  minutes.  Add the carrots and cook until the vegetables are tender, but not  mushy, about 10 minutes more. Let cool until easy to handle, then cut the  vegetables into 1/2-inch dice.  In a large salad bowl, combine the  potatoes, carrots, onion, pickles, peas, beet, scallions, and dill. Season  with salt and pepper and toss gently, taking care not to crush the  vegetables.  In a small bowl, whisk the dry mustard, sugar and vinegar  together. Whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss the salad  with the dressing and tasting to correct the seasoning. Cover and  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.    Makes 4 generous servings.
