(Breakfast in Bed)    Jesse Cool Owner/Chef, Flea Street Cafe Menlo Park CA Author, Breakfast in  Bed (Harper Collins, 1997)  "Aphrodisiac foods are those that turn on the senses and make your whole  being feel alive. Oysters and chocolate are a given, but for those that  know the hedonistic side of life, the options are limitless. Anything that  melts in my mouth, makes me purr when I savor its flavor or enjoy the  feeling of texture as I swallow. Yes, food is sexy, so why avoid it.  Rather, look for it. Just like sexiness and sensuality, its different for  everyone. I like soft, delicate textures that I can savor for a long time.  At this time of the year, this polenta dish, suggested as breakfast food in  my new cookbook sounds perfect. Imagine, a rainy Saturday morning. No where  to go. Forget all the things you have to do. Make this polenta and take two  bowls back to bed, one for you and one for your lover. You may just stay  under the covers longer than you thought."    Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Working quickly, whisk in  the cornmeal and salt, and reduce the heat to a simmer, cook, uncovered,  stirring frequently, until thick and velvety, at least 45 minutes. If the  polenta is too thick, add more water. You can never overcook polenta, it  just gets smoother and smoother. (My grandmother used to keep adding water  and cook it for hours).    Spoon the polenta into bowls and top it generously with mascarpone and  maple syrup. Serve in bed with a big spoon.    Pour any leftover polenta into a well-oiled pan. Refrigerate and re-heat or  grill in slices.    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Mar 04, 1998
