Poppyseed Chicken
Chicken, Ritz cracker, Sour cream, Butter, Poppy seeds, Cream of chicken soup, 
Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and put it on the bottom of a  casserole dish big enough to hold it.    Combine sour cream and condensed chicken soup in a pan and pour it over the  chicken in an even layer.    In the same pan, (save dishes!) melt the butter and add broken-up crackers  and poppy seeds. Mix together and distribute over the chicken and sauce.    Bake at about 325 degrees F. for 20-30 minutes, until the topping is brown,  the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is hot.    NOTES:    *  Chicken casserole with poppy seeds -- This is an easy and good way to  use some cooked chicken. I got the recipe from my grandmother, who "hates  to cook" but nevertheless seems to do a great job...    *  Somehow this doesnt seem very nutritious.  Serve it with lots of  vegetables.  Broccoli and carrots go well. Use more or less of the  ingredients to taste, or depending on how many you are serving. Use  different soups. Add mushrooms. Add other stuff. Have fun.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  40 minutes.  : Precision:  no need to measure.    : William "Chops" Westfield  : Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA  : "Cooking (and eating) is my second greatest passion."  : BillW@Score.Stanford.EDU, ...glacier!navajo!billw    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
