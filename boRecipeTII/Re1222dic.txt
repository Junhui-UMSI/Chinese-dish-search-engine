Crockpot Butterbean Stew
Rosemary, Bay Leaves, Thyme, Celery seed **, Salt to taste, Brown rice; maybe a cup, Large dried limas;, Water, (rounded) dried onion; or to, Chipotles; (dried type),, 
* dont substitute fresh; surprisingly, in this dish, its not as good.    ** very approximate, but dont overdo it. several dashes Maggi seasoning  (look near the Worcestershire in most supermarkets, or with the Latino food  at Meijers; its a dirt-cheap vegetarian way to add richness to soups and  stews).    Put everything but the Maggi, rice and salt in a crockpot (salt makes beans  get tender much slower.) Cook on "high" till the beans are tender and the  smell is driving you crazy; 20-30 min. before ready to serve, add rice,  salt and Maggi.    Makes maybe five or six big bowls.
