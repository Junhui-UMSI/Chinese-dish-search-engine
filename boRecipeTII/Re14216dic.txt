White Pizza - Authentic Italian
PIZZA DOUGH, olive oil, White flour, olive oil, Dry yeast, Salt, Coarse Kosher salt (sea, TOPPING, Warm water; 105 degrees, Dried Rosemary, 
Dissolve yeast in the warm water.  Add yeast/water mixture to 3 cups of the  flour.   Mix, adding regular salt and olive oil a little at a time.  Add  the rest of the flour bit by bit until the dough "feels right".    Turn dough onto a floured board and knead; adding more flour if necessary  to keep  the dough from sticking to your fingers.  Put the dough in a  greased bowl and rotate to distribute the grease all over the dough.  Let  rise until about double  in size (approx. 2 hours).    Remove the dough, punch down and roll out on the floured board to a  thickness of  3/8 to 1/2 inch (make it any shape you desire).  Put dough in  a pan or cookie sheet.  With a pastry brush, paint liberally with  additional olive oil.  Use your  thumb and 2 fingers to make dimples over  the entire surface.  Sprinkle the Kosher sea salt and rosemary over the  surface of the dough.  Let rise a little more.    Bake at 375 degrees F for about 25 minutes.  When done, paint liberally  again with olive oil.    Makes 1 white pizza.
