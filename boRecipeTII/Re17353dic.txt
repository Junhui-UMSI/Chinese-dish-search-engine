Walnut Beer Bread
Active dry yeast, Sugar, Salt, Water, Coarsely chopped walnuts, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Egg, Rye flour, Walnut oil, Warm beer, Finely chopped yellow onion, or as needed, Fresh or dried rosemary, 
Heat the beer to 105 to 115 F. and pour 1/2 cup into a small bowl. Stir in  the yeast and let stand 10 minutes.    Mix the flours, sugar and salt in a large bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Pour the yeast mixture, oil and remaining 1 cup beer into the well and stir  until blended.    Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 10  minutes, adding more flour if necessary.    Coat a large bowl with walnut oil.  Place the dough in the bowl and turn to  coat with oil.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until  doubled in bulk.  (You can also let the dough rise overnight in a cool  place or in the refrigerator.)    Punch dough down and knead in the onion and walnuts until evenly  distributed throughout the dough.    Divide dough in half.  Divide each half into thirds.  Using your hands,  roll each of the pieces into 12" long ropes.  Braid 3 ropes together to  form a loaf.  Tuck the ends under and place on an 18 x 12" baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining dough, placing it on the same baking sheet. Cover and  let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour.    Beat the egg and 2 tsp. water in a small bowl.  Brush the tops of the  loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle with rosemary.  Bake at 375 F. until  crusty and brown, 45 to 50 minutes.  Cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Turn  out onto wire racks and cool completely.    The authors write: "A hearty and rustic bread that makes an excellent  picnic lunch with cheese, especially goats milk cheese.  Take your  favorite full-bodied red wine along."
