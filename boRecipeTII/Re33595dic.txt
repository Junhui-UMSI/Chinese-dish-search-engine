Swedish Meatball Gravy
Butter, Instant coffee, Flour, Fresh mushrooms, Beef broth, Onions, 
Melt 2 T butter in large fry pan, over med heat. Add mushrooms and onions,  cover. Allow to cook until wilted. Remove mushrooms and onions, leaving  juices. Add remaining butter and melt. Add flour, stirring constantly. Add  1 1/4 cup broth and coffee. You may have to add more broth, depending on  how much juice came from the mushrooms and onions. Cook and stir until  bubbly. Return mushrooms and onions to pan, cooking until thickened. You  may add your cooked meatballs to the sauce at this time. Pour over noodles  or rice.    I hope you enjoy this. The coffee really adds flavor to the gravy. Posted  to KitMailbox Digest  by Leon & Miriam Posvolsky <miriamp@pobox.com> on Jul  16, 1997
