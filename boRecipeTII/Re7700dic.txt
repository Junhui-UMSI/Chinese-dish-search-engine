Trim fat from pork and cut pork into 3/4-inch cubes. Mix together pork,  vinegar, onion, garlic and red pepper in glass or plastic bowl. Cover and  refrigerate, stirring occasionally, at least 6 hours. Fry bacon until  crisp. Drain. Remove pork from marinade, reserving marinade. Cook and stir  pork in bacon fat until all liquid has evaporated and pork is brown on all  sides. Drain. Mix together pork, reserved marinade, bacon and remaining  ingredients in ungreased 2-quart casserole. Cover. Bake at 350F until  liquid is absorbed, 25 to 30 minutes. Though Arroz con Carne de Cerdo is a  traditional casserole from the Dominican Republic, it hints of Africa where  highly seasoned combinations of rice and meat are common.
