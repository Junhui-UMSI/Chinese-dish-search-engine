1. Heat 2tb oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the potatoes until they turn  medium brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.  (Omit this step for a lower-fat dish.)    2. Add 2 tablespoons oil to the pan and heat over medium low heat. Fry bay  leaf, red chili, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves for a few seconds. Add  onion and fry until richly browned but not burnt, 18 to 20 minutes,  stirring constantly.    3. Stir in ginger, garlic, green chili, turmeric, cumin, and sugar. Add  meat and water. Lower the heat and simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Add the  potatoes and simmer, covered, until both meat and potatoes are tender,  about 30 more minutes. Turn heat very low. Blend in yogurt, nuts, and salt  and remove from heat. (Prolonged heating will curdle the sauce, detracting  from its appearance and texture.) Stir in garam masala. Decorate with onion  rings and cilantro.    From The Flavors of India, by Bharti Kirchner    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
