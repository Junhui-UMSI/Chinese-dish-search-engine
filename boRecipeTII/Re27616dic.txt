This is the recipe from the Black Labrador Pub in Houston, TX. It was  posted today in the Houston Chronicle.    Saute beef, onion, celery and garlic in large pan until well-done, about 20  minutes. Strain the beef mixture. Make a gravy with beef base and water and  whisk in enough flour to thicken, about 2 Tbl.    When gravy comes to a boil, add the beef mixture. Drain cooked potatoes and  mash with butter; set aside. Blanch carrots (cook briefly in boiling water)  and add to beef mixture. Place in a shallow 2-quart casserole or baking  pan. Spoon potatoes on top of beef. Bake 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Top  with cheese and let sit until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Makes 6 to        8    servings.    NOTE: Beef base is a commercial product usually found in supermarkets on  the soup and bouillon shelves. It is a paste. The Black Labrador uses  Frosted Acres; another brand is Monirs. One cup bouillon or stock may be  substituted for beef base and water for gravy.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 570 by jecraig@lan-inc.com on  Jan 21, 9
