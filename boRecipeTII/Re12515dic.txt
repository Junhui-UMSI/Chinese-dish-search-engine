Yellowman Toffee
Water, Butter, Vinegar, Baking soda, Golden syrup, Brown sugar, 
Yellowman is thick and sweet, And much tradition lies behind it; For  centuries at Lammas Fair In Ballycastle, you would find it.    To make this toffee, first you melt The butter in a heavy pan; Add sugar,  syrup, vinegar, And start to boil your Yellowman.    To test it, take a spoonful up And in cold water let it fall: Its ready if  the mixture turns Into a crisp and brittle ball.    Now put the baking soda in-- Youll find that it will foam and froth; So  take a spoon and rapidly Keep stirring up the bubbling broth.    Now pour it in a well-greased tin; Cool, then break in bits to eat. Youll  soon know why, at Lammas fair, The Yellowman was such a treat.
