Potato Dumplings (Maloney)
Pasta sauce; for serving, Flour, New potatoes, Salt, 
Boil potatoes in their skins just until tender. Be careful not to overcook  to the point where potatoes split. Drain and allow to cool. Peel the  potatoes and put them through a potato ricer or mash with a fork (be sure  to mash out all lumps).    Spread out on counter top and allow to cool. When quite cool, bring 4  quarts of salted water to a boil.    Now work the flour, a little at a time, into the cooled mashed potatoes,  add some salt and form a loaf. cut loaf into quarters and roll each quarter  with your hands on a floured board until it forms a cylinder about 1/2 inch  thick. With knife cut into pieces about 3/4 inch long. Repeat until all  dough has been used.    Slip gnocchi into the boiling water and cook until they float to the top.  no more than a minute or two. Do not overcook as the gnocchi will fall  apart if cooked too long. Drain gnocchi and toss in the sauce.    >From Cook and Tell by Liz Caesar, 18-Feb-98, Riverside Press-Enterprise.  Topic: Gnocchi (pronouced no-key or yo-key, Italian, for dumplings). An  excellent side dish. >another McBust from Pat Hanneman (kitpath)    Notes: Many cooks insist the secret to light gnocchi is to use a mimimal  amount of flour, no eggs and to allow the potatoes to cool before mashing.
