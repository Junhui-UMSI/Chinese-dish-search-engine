Good-For-You Apple Bran Muffins With Walnuts And Orange Zest
Walnuts, Butter, Salt, Oat bran, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Nonfat dry milk, Dark brown sugar, Cinnamon, Salt, Baking Powder, Carrot, Granny Smith apple, Zest of 2 oranges, Egg, Egg whites, Buttermilk, Canola oil, crushed pineapple, Nonstick cooking spray, 
1. Arrange shelf just below the center of oven and preheat the oven to 350?  F.    2. Roast the walnuts on a baking sheet for 10 to 12 minutes. While the nuts  are hot, stir in the butter and sprinkle with salt. Set aside.    3. Raise the oven temperature to 450? F.    4. Combine the oat bran, flour, dry milk, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and  baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Work any lumps out of the sugar with  your fingers if necessary. Add the grated carrot, orange zest, and nuts.  Stir to combine.    5. Beat together the egg, egg whites, buttermilk, oil, pineapple, and  vanilla in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture  and stir to combine.    6. Spray a standard-size muffin tin with Pam, grease well, or use paper  liners. Spoon 1/3 cup muffin batter into each cup; this should just fill  each cup to the brim. You willl have enough to fill a 12-muffin pan with  enough batter left for a few more muffins. If filling two or three cups in  a six- muffin pan, fill the empty spaces with water so that they will not  burn. Bake until browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. Tap the sides of the pan  on the counter to loosen the muffins and turn out onto a rack to cool.  Serve warm or at room temperature.    Makes 14 muffins.    NOTE: There is no vanilla listed in the ingredients list for this recipe,  but it is mentioned in the directions. Use your judgment here. I would try  about 1 tsp. and see how that works out.
