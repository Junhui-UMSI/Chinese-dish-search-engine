Mix manually the ingredients of the crust. Bake it until half cooked  in oven (medium heating).    Prepare the first layer. Melt the chocolate in the juice. Add the  other ingredients except the whites. Add the other ingredients. Let  it boil gently. Beat the whites. Mix everything. Pour it in the crust    Slice the pears. Dispose them in the crust. Return the lot in the  oven.    Prepare the second layer. Melt the chocolate in the juice. Add the  other ingredients. Let it boil gently. Pour it over the pie.    Let the pie cool, put it in the fridge. Serve it very cool.    It is absolutly delicous and is very very easy to make, even if it may  sound difficult.    I prefer it with extra chocolate and extra whisky.    In fact the proportions dont matter much. Just put as much of an  ingredient\ as you want. The result is always good.    Sorry i forgot about the yolks. Beat them and add them to the mixture  after the boiling. (at the same time as you add the whites).
