Put mung beans in a bowl with 3 cups water.  Cover lightly and set aside  for 12 hours.  Drain beans and wrap in a very damp dish towel. Put the  wrapped bundle in a bowl. Put this bowl in a dark place (like an unused  oven) for 24 hours.    Wash rice well and soak in 4 cups of water for half an hour. Drain well.    Preheat oven to 325 F.    Heat oil in a wide, heavy, 4- to 5-quart ovenproof pot over a medium-high  flame.  When hot, put in mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin  to pop (this takes just a few seconds), put in the onion. Stir and fry for  about 5 minutes or until onion turns brown at the edges. Add the garlic and  ginger.  Fry, stirring, for about 1 minute. Turn heat to medium-low and add  the mung beans, rice, string beans, mushrooms, garam masala, ground  coriander, and salt.  Stir and saute for about 10 minutes or until rice  turns translucent and vegetables are well coated with oil. Add 4 cups hot  water and the minced parsley.  Turn heat to a medium-high flame and cook,  stirring, for about 5 minutes or until most of the water is absorbed.  (There will be an inch or so of water at the bottom.) Cover the pot first  with aluminum foil, crimping and sealing the edges, and then with its own  lid.  Place in heated oven for half an hour.  Fluff up with a fork and  serve.
