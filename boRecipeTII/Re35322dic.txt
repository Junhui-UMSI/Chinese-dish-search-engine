Place in a shallow baking dish lined  with heavy-duty foil. Pour liquid smoke over the meat. Wrap tightly;  marinate 8 to 10 hours in the refrigerator, the longer the better. When  ready to bake, sprinkle Worcestershire sauce over the meat. Wrap tightly.  Preheat oven at 225 for 5 to 6 hours or to your liking. Let cool; save  broth. Slice meat thin, and reheat in broth. You may reheat this in your  favorite barbecue sauce. busted by sooz  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 170 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Oct 27, 1997
