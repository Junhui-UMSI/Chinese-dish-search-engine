Additives for variety requiring no change to basic list    Allspice up to        7g OK Cinnamon up to 7g OK Dried Currents up to 60g  OK Chile to taste Orange and Lemon Zest to taste (grated fresh outer peel)  Cake and Bun improver  5 drops          Additives which require corrections to basic recipe    Eggs - reduce water by the weight of the egg(s) Fruit - reduce water by  estimating water content of fruit Fruit Juice - reduce water by weight of  juice          Additives which failed (too little rise)    Nutmeg - did it kill the yeast or destroy the natural gluten? Rye flour -  OK up to about 20% of flour but height lost          Care of Yeast    I purchase 500g of Instant Dried Yeast at a time. Fill 2 small coffee jars  and store one sealed with glad wrap in the freezer. The other one is stored  in the frig with a sealed plastic lid. When the first jar is finished,  allow the second, frozen jar to reach frig temperature in the frig before  use (to reduce the condensation). There is some small deterioration of the  second jar towards the end of the batch. I increase the yeast used by up to  10% to counter this. The adjustment is made as a result of the previous  loaf not being quite as high as usual.    >From: Jack Jordan <jjord@adam.com.au>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
