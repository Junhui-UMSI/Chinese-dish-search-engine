Ajs Pale Ale
Pale dry extract, Willamette hops (boil), Light brown sugar, Hallertauer hops, Irish moss, Clusters hops pellets, Pale malt, Crystal malt, Gypsum, Red Star ale yeast, 
Mash pale malt, crystal malt, and gypsum in 2-3/4 gallons of 170  degree  water;  this should give initial heat of 155 degrees (pH 5.0).  Maintain  temperature at 140-155 degrees for 2 hours. Sparge. To wort, add extract  and  brown  sugar.  Boil  with Willamette hops.  After  15  minutes  add  Hallertauer and Irish moss. Dry hop with clusters and steep. When  cool,  add wort to carboy and pitch yeast. The posted recipe called for 4 pounds  of dry extract with 2  cups  re- served for priming. This seemed excessive  and a good way to get  explod- ing bottles, so we reduced the amount of  extract to 3-1/2  pounds  and assumed that standard priming techniques  would be used, maybe  replacing corn sugar with 3/4 to 1 cup of malt  extract. --- Ed. Notice that I screwed up the hops: Clusters are for  bittering,  and Willamette (or Fuggles) for aromatic.
