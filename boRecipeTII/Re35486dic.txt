Strawberry-Cherry Conserve
Sugar, Orange, Strawberries, Cherries, 
Heres a couple of conserve recipes (untried), that I found in a little  Dell book my Mom had, dated 1975.    Wash, hull and sort strawberries. Wash, stem and pit cherries. Chop orange  and its peel, discarding pits. Combine fruits and weigh. Measure into  kettle, adding an equal amount of sugar. Bring to a medium boil while  stirring. Lower heat and simmer until mixture thickens. Ladel into hot jars  and seal.
