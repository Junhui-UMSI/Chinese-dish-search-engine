Raised Pork Pie
Plain flour, Mixed dried herbs, Jellied stock, jar, HOT WATER CRUST, Salt and pepper, Salt, Lard, Milk, Pork, Milk, 
Dice pork for filling, season well and add herbs. For hot water crust: warm  a mixing bowl and sift in flour and salt, make a well in the centre of the  flour. Heat lard in milk and water. When just boiling, pour into the well  in the flour, stir quickly with a wooden spoon until thick, then work with  hand to a dough. Turn on to a board or table, cut off a quarter of the  dough, put it back in the bowl and cover with a cloth.    Pat out the rest of dough with the fist to a thick round, set a large jar  in the centre and work dough up sides. Let dough cool then gently lift out  jar.  Fill dough case with meat mixture. Roll or pat out remaining dough to  form a lid, leave a small hole in it, then put on top of pie, seal edges.  Glaze with milk if wished.    Slide pie on to a baking sheet and bake in pre-set oven for 1-1 1/2 hours  at 350 F.  If pie is getting too brown, cover with damp greasproof paper  towards end of cooking time. Leave till cool before placing a funnel in  hole in lid and filling up with jellied stock.    WATCHPOINT You must work quickly and mould pastry while it is still warm,  otherwise lard sets and pastry becomes brittle. (I make small ones using  small jars or straight sided glasses)    * Please dont ask me what a kilner jar is cause I dont know.
