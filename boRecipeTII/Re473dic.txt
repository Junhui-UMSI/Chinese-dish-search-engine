Lemon Poppy Seed Bread
Lemon cake mix, Hot water, Cooking oil, Eggs, Poppy seed, lemon instant pudding, 
Combine. Put in 2 greased loaf pans. Bake at 350 deg for 45-50 minutes.  After you take them out of the oven, prick the top with a fork and pour  over the glaze.    Glaze: 1/2 cup sugar and 5 Tbls lemon juice.    Cool and remove from pans.    Note: I usually cut the glaze if half, because I think that the glaze is  too sweet.
