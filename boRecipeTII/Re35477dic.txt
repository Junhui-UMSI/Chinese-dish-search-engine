Sprinkle one side with the combined seasonings  and beat with a meat hammer. Turn and repeat the seasoning and beating.  Place the strips on a cookie sheet or other flat pan. Place in a 120 F oven  for 4 hrs. Turn and put back for another 4 hrs. Keep the oven door propped  open for the entire time to allow the moisture to escape. With a gas oven,  the pilot light may be enough to provide the heat. Store in a plastic bag.  Also may be stored in a pillowcase. Do not store in a paper bag.
