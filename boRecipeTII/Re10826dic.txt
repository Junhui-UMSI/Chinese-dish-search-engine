The original called for real beef; I modified it  to leave that out and the 1 tsp of oil. IMHO, I think the Gimme Lean can be  left out and chickpeas or some other bean could be used, but I wanted to  try it this way first. YMMV    In a non-stick dutch oven, saute the onion and garlic in veggie broth for  two-three minutes.  Add the Gimme Lean, breaking it up with the spatula as  it cooks. (Use more veggie broth as needed). Let this cook for about five  minutes while you prepare the quinoa:    Rinse the quinoa in cold water and drain.  Bring the two cups water to boil  and add the quinoa.  Cook 10-15 minutes, until quinoa has absorbed the  water and you can see the white germ ring.    While the quinoa is cooking, add the remaining ingredients (except the  spices) to the dutch oven and stir while cooking.  When the quinoa is  cooked, add it to the dutch oven and stir to combine. Add herbs and spices  and cook a few minutes more to soften the parsley. Taste and re-spice as  needed.    Graham Kerr served this with potatoes that had been mashed with parsley and  buttermilk piped on to the plate. Then the quinoa stuff was put inside the  potato ring.  I didnt get that fancy; I just served the quinoa stuff on a  plate w/out potatoes.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #114    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
