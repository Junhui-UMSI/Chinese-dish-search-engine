Ziti Al Forno; Baked Ziti
Tomato sauce, Nutmeg, Salt, Chopped parsley, Pepper, Oregano, Parmesan cheese, Sweet Italian sausage, Ricotta cheese, Sugar, 
I got this recipe from my Italian Grandfather. Mix tomato sauce with  oregano and parsley, heat.  Slide sausage out of casing, brown until light  and crumbled, drain. Combine ricotta, nutmeg, salt, pepper and sugar,  blending well.  Cook and drain Ziti.  Spoon half the sauce in 9x13  casserole, half the Ziti, spoon on all the sausage and ricotta mixture. Add  remaining Ziti and top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with parmesan. Bake  uncovered at 400 degrees for 15 min. or until hot. This recipe can be made  ahead and frozen or refrigerated, just allow extra baking time. FROM: LISA  HUNTER   (BVBD27B)
