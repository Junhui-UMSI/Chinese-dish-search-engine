In large mixer bowl,  beat 1 1/2 cups butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating with an electric mixer a full 3 minutes  after each addition.  (this is very important and necessary). Fold in  whipped cream and 1 cup coarsely crushed candy. Turn 1/2 of cream mixture  into pan. Drizzle melted and cooled chocolate mixture over surface to  within 1/2 inch of outside edge. Smooth chocolate layer. Gently spoon  remaining cream mixture over chocolate; smooth top. Sprinkle with remaining  chocolate candy mixture.  Using the back of a spoon, lightly press into  surface of torte.  Cover and freeze at least 4 hours. Torte may be tightly  covered and frozen up to 1 month. To loosen torte, run a thin knife around  inside edge of pan; remove side.
