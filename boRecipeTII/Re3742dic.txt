Penne with Broccoli
Red pepper flakes, parmesan, Penne, garlic, Broccoli, salt and pepper, olive oil, 
Here are two recipes I adapted from Andrew Weils SPONTANEOUS HEALING using  broccoli, which is supposed to have all sorts of nutrients and special  qualities. I also read (elsewhere) that some people are genetically  predisposed to HATE broccoli and similar vegetables, so if you dont like  it, dont feel guilty. Feel better, President Bush?    Bring pasta pot full of water to a boil (covered to heat more quickly). Add  salt and cook penne until tender. Meanwhile, wash broccoli. Cut off the  flowers and separate into bite-size chunks. Peel stems and cut into slices.  Heat the olive oil and cook the garlic a few seconds, stirring so as not to  let it burn. Throw in the broccoli with the water clinging to it and cover  to let steam until the broccoli is bright-green and still crunchy-tender,  no more than five minutes or so. Add seasonings and a little water to  produce steam if necessary, or remove lid to boil off the liquid if too  wet. Drain penne, but reserve a little of the pasta water in case its  needed. Add cooked penne to the broccoli. Sprinkle over a little of the  pasta water if its too dry and serve with parmesan cheese.
