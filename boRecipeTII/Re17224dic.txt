Place all ingredients except the tomatoes in food processor, add enough  tomatoes to make it blend well. Chop it up fine. (If your food processor is  small, you may have to do it in batches.) Pour it all in a large Tupperware  container. Add the rest of the tomatoes, after mushing them up by hand to  get the desired consistancy. Stir well. This stuff gets better the next  day. This recipe makes a couple of quarts. It lasts me about a week. It  keeps well for that long in the refridgerator. Hope you enjoy it!
