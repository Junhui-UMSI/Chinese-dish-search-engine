Raspberry Curd
Half-pint baskets, Lemon juice; toto taste, Eggs, Sugar, Unsalted butter, Egg yolks, 
Puree the raspberries and put them through a fine strainer to remove the  seeds. Measure 1 1/2 cups puree, heat it in a non-corroding saucepan, and  stir in the sugar and butter. Taste and add the lemon juice to taste. Whisk  the eggs and egg yolks just enough to mix them, then stir in some of the  hot puree to warm them. Return to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring  constantly, until the mixture is thick -- it should reach a temperature of      170    degrees F. Chill.    Makes about 2 cups, enough to fill one 9-inch tart.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #756 by Country Gourmet  <oselands@countrygourmet.com> on Aug 22, 1997
