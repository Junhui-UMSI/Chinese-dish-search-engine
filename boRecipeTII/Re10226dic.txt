Quick and Easy Muffins (Gluten Free)
Vanilla, white rice flour, GF flour mix, potato starch flour, Sugar, Shortening, Salt, tapioca flour, Milk, Eggs, Baking Powder, GF(GLUTENFREE FLOUR MIX), 
In the mixing bowl, cream together sugar and shortening. Then beat in the  eggs.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder and add to the egg  mixture alternately with the milk.  Dont overbeat. Stir in the vanilla.  These are best mixed by hand. Pour into greased muffin cups. Bake in  preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes. Makes 8 muffins. NOTE: I  poured half the batter in the muffin tins and sprinkled a mixture of  cinnamon and sugar over the batter. I covered with the remaining batter and  sprinkled the tops with more cinnamon and sugar.
