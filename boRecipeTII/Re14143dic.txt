White Fantasy Fudge
Peanuts (salted & skinless), White chocolate, Pretzel sticks, Chunkey peanut butter, Butterscotch chips, 
Melt the peanut butter, chocolate and, chips in a large pot. Then add  enough peanuts and pretzels so that it is tough to stir, mixing well so  that all are coated well...    Pour into a greased 13" X 9" pan and chill in the `fridge `til hard...    Remove and cut into bars or break into chunks of desired size...    *note... It will be easier to cut into pieces or break into chunks if you  dump it out of the pan first...  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #299 by "Fred Goslin"  <fjgoslin@northnet.org> on Nov 18, 1997
