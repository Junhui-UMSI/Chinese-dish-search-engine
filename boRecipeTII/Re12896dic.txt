Place chicken on a large plate and rub over with lemon juice. Set aside for  at least 20 minutes, then pat fry with kitchen paper. Mix salt, cayenne and  flour on a plate and dredge chicken pieces, shaking off excess. Melt butter  in pan, add the chicken and fry until browned. Add onions, garlic, ginger  and cumin seeds and fry until golden brown. Stir in yoghurt, cream and  lemon rind.  Return chicken to mixture and mix until all chicken is well  coated.  Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour  or until chicken is cooked. Uncover the pan for the last 20 minutes, to  allow sauce to reduce.  Discard lemon rind (if you can find it) before  serving.    I found that the mixture was too dry for the quantity of chicken, so I used  additional yoghurt/sour cream and the coconut cream to get the consistency  I liked. WALT    Philippa Jane Wightman P.O.
