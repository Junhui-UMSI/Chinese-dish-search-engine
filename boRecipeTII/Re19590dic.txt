With the machine running, pour the oil in a thin, steady stream.    3. Add the cheese, salt and ground pepper to taste.  Process briefly to  combine.  Yield: 2 cups prepared pesto.    NOTE: I make this in 2-cup batches & freeze in 1/2 pt. canning jars for the  winter.  Use on pasta, vegetables, baked potatoes...
