Anytime Thanksgiving Burgers
Onions, Salt, Black pepper, Butter, Poultry seasoning, Ground chicken, Dry seasoned stuffing mix, Chopped fresh parsley, Cranberry sauce, Celery, chicken broth, 
In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the  celery and onions and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove the  skillet from the heat and add the stuffing mix, broth, salt, pepper, and  poultry seasoning; mix well. Let the mixture cool completely, then transfer  to a large bowl. Mix in the chicken and parsley. Form into 5 or 6  equal-sized patties. Add the remaining butter to the skillet and melt over  medium-high heat. Add the patties and brown for 1 minute per side. Reduce  the heat to medium-low and cook for 4 to 5 more minutes per side, until the  patties are cooked through and spring back when touched.    NOTE: Top each burger with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce or cranberry  relish for that complete Thanksgiving taste...anytime!    >From Mr. Food    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Abtaxel <Abtaxel@aol.com> on Apr 22, 1998
