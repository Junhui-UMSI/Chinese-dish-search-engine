Chop 2 of the onions and set aside.  Chop remaining onion fine. Salt a  large skillet.  Turn heat to medium and add meat, finely chopped onion, and  garlic. Break up meat with fork and cook until it is browned. Drain fat.    Add barbeque sauce and water.  Bring to a boil.  Add remaining seasonings.    Cover and simmer over very low heat 30 minutes, stirring and tasting  occasionally, adding tomato juice if mixture is getting too dry. Chili is  best when allowed to age overnight in refrigerator and reheated.    To construct the plate of 5-way chili, layer spaghetti on a plate (a small  oval plate is traditional), top it with hot chili, then with a sparse layer  of beans, then chopped onions. Pat on plenty of cheese while chili is still  hot and serve immediately, with oyster crackers on the side. Serves 4.
