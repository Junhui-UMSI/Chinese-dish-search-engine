Preheat oven to 375.  Combine all ingredients except candy in a large bowl.  Mix on lowest speed of mixer until dough forms.  Shape dough into balls,  using a rounded teaspoonful for each. Roll balls in sugar; place on  ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 375 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes. Top each  cookie immediately with a candy; press down firmly so cookie cracks around  edge.     Makes about       48    cookies.  Recipe By     : Monroe Evening News  Dec 10, 1995    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #286    Date: Fri, 8 Nov 1996 15:01:01 -0500    From: sara <sara@tdi.net>
