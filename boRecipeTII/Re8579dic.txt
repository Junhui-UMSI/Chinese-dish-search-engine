This recipe may be used with only one kind of potato, but becomes a little  more unusual with sweet and white combined.  A recipe in Bon Apetit Nov.  1988 page 100 for Yam slices baked with rosemary and garlic became the  inspiration for this new created reciipe.  This was first served at  Thanksgiving, 1988 for 23 people and has become a staple for festive meals  when potatoes are called for.  Even make it during Pesach, sometimes  changing the herbs a little.    Scrub potatoes leaving skins on and cut into bite size pieces.  Combine  garlic with herbs mixing well.  Coat potatoes with olive oil and spice  garlic mixture, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Toss to  coat the potatoes.  Spread in one layer in one or two oven proof pans. Bake  in preheated 450oF oven until potatoes are tender and crusty, stirring  occasionally, about 50 minutes.
