Vegetable Tajine - Moroccan Stew

I made these two recipes over the weekend - theyre from Sundays at  Moosewood cookbook, with appropriate changes to make them. I really like  exotic recipes so I enjoy this cookbook a lot - my husband just loves these  2 recipes - he keeps teasing me that all they need to be perfect is some  chunks of lamb! Anyway, here they are:    Sate the onions and garlic in your favorite sauteeing medium until onions  are translucent. Add the thyme, potatoes, green beans, bell pepper, and  tomatoes and cook on medium-high heat for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the vegetable stock and the brine from the artichokes and simmer,  covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.    Stir in the halved artichoke hearts, the black olives (if you use them),  and a pinch of saffron. Continue to simmer gently for another 5 to 10  minutes. Add the lemon juice, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.    Serve with bread or on couscous (also suggests to sprinkle with chopped  almonds).
