The roasted peppers can be canned, drained, picked clean of any bits of  charred skin and chopped into 1/2-inch dice; if bell peppers are in season,  freshly roasted pepper can be used. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.; adjust  shelf to lower level. Spray-grease a 10-inch pieplate or quiche dish. Steam  potato until tender, about 30 minutes. Peel and mash (or put through  ricer); mix with salt and pepper.    Spread evenly on bottom and sides of prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with  cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.    In a small skillet or sautepan, heat oil. Cook shallot (OR green onion),  stirring, until tender. Add chives, bell pepper, parsley, salt and cayenne.  Stir together and heat through.    In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs. Add milk and Parmesan cheese and mix  well. Add crab and seasoning mixture; mix well. Carefully pour mixture into  partially baked potato crust. Bake in preheated oven for 35-40 minutes,  until slightly puffed, golden brown and firm.    Serves 6 -- Per serving: CAL: 187 Grams of PRO: 16....of CARB: 16....of  FAT: 6.7    1996 (c) Jane A.

If you happen to make  this during bell pepper season, then you need to find frozen or canned  crab.
