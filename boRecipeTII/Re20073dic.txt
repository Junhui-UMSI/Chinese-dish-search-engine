Vanilla Custard
Egg yolks, Sugar, Fluid ounces  heavy cream, 
In a two quart saucepan, bring sugar and cream to a boil. Whisk in egg  yolks, turn heat to low, and continue to stir constantly until custard  thickens and thoroughly coats a spoon.    Strain custard into a stainless steel bowl set inside another bowl filled  with ice and stir frequently. This is to ensure rapid cooling of custard so  that it does not curdle. Wrap custard and reserve in the refrigerator.    NOTE: This recipe is used to prepare the "Dessert Tostada" recipe in this  cookbook, but can be prepared on its own.
