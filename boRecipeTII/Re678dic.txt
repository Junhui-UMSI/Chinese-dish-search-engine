Graham Cracker Gingerbread Houses (Makes 6 Houses)
Cream of tartar, Vanilla, Keebler graham crackers, Egg whites, Powdered sugar, 
Cut 2 long pieces and 2 short end pieces with points on end out of graham  crackers.  Make royal icing ("glue") by beating egg whites, sugar, cream of  tartar and vanilla for 7-10 minutes until very stiff. "Glue" 2 whole graham  crackers on top for roof after "gluing" the 4 pieces above together for the  base of the house.  Use icing for snow effect and as glue to add candy  decorations (licorice, M & Ms, etc.).
