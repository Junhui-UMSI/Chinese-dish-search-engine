1. Combine the raisins and apple cider in a small saucepan and bring to a  boil over medium heat. Immediately remove from the heat and set aside to  plump the raisins.    2. In a large, non-reactive saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over  medium heat. Add the celery and onions, and cook slowly, stirring until  softened, about 6-8 minutes.    3. Add the sausage meat and continue cooking until the meat begins to  brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the diced apples and sage, and cook an  additional 5 minutes.    4. Strain the raisins from the apple cider, reserving the cider, and add  the raisins to the saucepan. Stir in the bread cubes, season with the salt  and pepper, and add the reserved cider. Bring to a boil, then lower the  heat to simmer the stuffing, covered, for 1/2 hour, stirring after 15  minutes. Serve hot, alongside roast Wild Turkey.
