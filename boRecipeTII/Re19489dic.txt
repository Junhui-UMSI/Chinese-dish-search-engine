Angelhair Pasta and Grouper
brussel sprouts, cabbage, Broccoli, Dried basil, Italian frying peppers, Cappelini, olive oil, garlic, parmesan cheese, Parsley, Grouper, Sweet red pepper, tomatoes, fresh, Salt and black pepper, Onion, 
1.  In a skillet, sautee the garlic, onion and frying peppers in the olive  oil until onion is transluscent (about 2 min). Add the Broccoli and let it  cook until bright green.    2.  Add the rest of the peppers and the brussel sprouts/cabbage, the  tomatoes, basil and salt and pepper. Toss very well so the tomatoes have a  chance to cook. Add the grouper andcover for about 5 min.    3.  The liquid from the fish mixes with the tomatos for a kind of sauce.  Add the parsley and cover until the fish is cooked all the way through.    4.  Take off heat and mix with the cheese. Some people may like more than  1/2 cup of cheese so keep it handy.    5.  Serve over Cappelini.    Authors Notes: Here is a kind of throw together recipe I came up with:    If you are entertaining you can garnish with fresh parsley and serve with a  caesar salad, garlic bread and a nice chablis. The vegetables can vary.  Ive used mushrooms, spinach, cauliflower etc. Grouper works well with this  because it has a lot of flavor. Ive used fresh tuna and halibut but prefer  grouper.    Difficulty    : easy. Precision  : measure ingredients.    Recipe By     : Doris Woods dfw@needle..bellcore.com
