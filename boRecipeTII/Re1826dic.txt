Chicken Picante Stew
Kielbasa; lean, chopped, Chicken breast; no skin, no, Chicken broth, Picante sauce, Bell pepper; chopped, Celery, Potatoes OR; diced, Rice, 
Cut chicken and sausage into bite sized pieces. Add onions, peppers,  celery, potatoes, picante sauce & broth. Cook for 1 to 1/2 hours or  pressure cook meat for 10 minutes then cook all ingredients for 30 minutes.    NOTES : Freezing Instructions - My family likes this better when we use  rice to freeze this.  We only do the potatoes when we will eat it that day  (or as leftovers for the next week).
