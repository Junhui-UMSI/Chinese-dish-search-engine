Chile-Head Patty Melts
1/4 lb. hamburger patties, Hamburger buns, Diced green chiles; mild, Chipotle puree, Mayonnaise, Onion; diced small, Pepperjack cheese, GARNISHES, Onion; sliced, Hot mustard, Catsup, Chipotle peppers; diced, Tomatoes; sliced, 
Thaw the hamburger patties. While they are thawing you can mix the  mayonnaise with 4 tablespoons of the chipotle puree, put in a covered  container & place in fridge until patty melts are cooked.    Heat a heavy cast iron skillet. Toss in the diced onions & stir fry until  the onions are translucent & start to brown slightly. Add the green chiles  & 4 tablespoons of chipotle puree. Stir to mix well. Remove from heat & let  cool while the burgers finish thawing.    When the burger patties are thawed completely, take 1 burger patty & spread  out a generous amount of the onion & chile mixture to within 1/2 inch of  the edges. Take a second burger patty & lay on top of the first, carefully  use your fingers to seal the edges of the patties together. Repeat with the  remaining burger patties & chile mixture.    If you are very careful with these assembled patty melts you can cook them  on the grill. Otherwise cook them in the skillet you cooked the chile  mixture in, just wipe it out & heat it before cooking the patty melts. Or  you can put them on a broiler pan & broil in your oven. When the patty  melts are done. Spread some of the Chipotle mayo on both sides of the bun,  place a slice of cheese on the top half of the buns & add any other  garnishes desired.
