Wedding Soup
Salt and pepper, Soup bone, Soup vegetables, Beef Shank (cross cuts), Whole tomatoes, Parsley flakes, Onion, Macaroni soup mac, 
Boil water, soup bone, meat (as much as you like), and onion (cut in half).  Fill pan (largest pan you have) 3/4 full. Bring to a slow boil and cook for  hours over low. After water boils, add vegetables (use frozen or add fresh  carrots and celery), parsley flakes, tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook  macaroni separately and add to soup prior to serving. With ground meat,  make meat balls as normal and add them directly into soup. Cook along with  soup for hours but make meatballs very small. Serve soup in bowl with  grated parmasan cheese sprinkled on top.  Soup is very filling with  meatballs, macaroni and meat.
