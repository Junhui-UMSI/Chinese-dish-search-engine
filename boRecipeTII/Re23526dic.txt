My family is a very  traditional Italian family who recently (well, 8 years ago) got into ff/lf  veg dieting. We slimmed down many sauce recipies as well as reduced the  acidity of the sauce. Enjoy!    Saute the diced tomatoes and diced onion in a little water for a 3-5  minutes.  Add the spices, diced garlic, pepper and onion.  Melt in the  tomato paste and simmer for 15-20 minutes, it will cook down to a nice  light sauce. Add more tomato paste if you want a thicker sauce. Add more  tomatoes if you want a chunkier sauce.    I dont mean to be criptic with the measurements, my Grandmother taught me  how to "sight cook" and I rarely use spoons or cups, if it smells good and  the spices look evenly distributed, Im happy.
