Kreplach
DOUGH, Flour, Eggs, Cold water, MEAT, Beef for pot roast, 
This reminded me to look for my grandmothers kreplach recipe since I promised my mom I'd make it this year for Rosh Hashanah (I'm always in charge of soup even if were not eating at my house.) I do have a request with this however. Someone please give me some direction regarding the best meat to buy and some idea regarding "regular seasoning." In fact, some direction on how to cook it is appreciated. (Youll see what I mean when you get to the recipe part!)  Dough: Sift flour into mixing bowl.  Make a well in center.  Add eggs and combine with a fork, adding water as necessary to form a ball of dough that is compact but not hard. Knead until smooth and elastic. Roll out a portion of the dough.  It should be rolled thin on a lightly floured board. Cover the portion you are not rolling to prevent drying (Grandma used a large bowl and I think some plastic wrap - not a tea towel.). Cut rolled dough into 1 1/2 inch squares.  After adding meat (recipe to follow), fold one corner over diagonally to form a triangle and press edges together. Drop into pot of boiling salted water.  Cook 10 to 15 minutes or until they rise to the top. Yield:  2 batters for 3 pounds of meat.      Meat (sorry guys, this is the recipe I was given!): Make it very soft, regular seasoning.  Chop well, including some gravy.
