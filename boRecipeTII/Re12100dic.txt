C       T  salt Gail some time ago you requested some information about  Ozoni the Japanese National Dish for New Years. There are probably as many  recipes for Zoni as there are cooks busy preparing the dish but they are  all fairly similar. Slice the chicken very thin and sprinkle with the  cornstarch. Then pound the chicken with the back of a knife to enlarge the  pieces. Boil in water for 5 minutes Slice the Kamaboko into 6 pieces 1/4  inch thick Slice the carrot into thin slices and after peeling the taro  slice them into thin round slices. Boil the carrots and taro in 1/2 C of  dashi. When soft add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp shoyu. Boil the spinach or  watercress in hot water being sure to remove them from the boiling water  when still very green. Cut the greens into 1 inch lengths. Slice the Yazu  into thin strips to represent pine needles. Toast the Rice cakes. Boil 6  cups of dashi and flavor with the 1 tbs. salt and the 1 Tbs. shoyu. Add the  Kamaboko, carrots , taro and the greens. Place two pieces of the toasted  Mochi, two slices of the chicken, 1 slice of the carrot, 2 slices of taro,  1 slice of the kamaboko and a little of the greens in each of six bowls  Pour the hot soup over them and then float the yazu needles on the top.  Naturally any good Japanese family in Japan would have had a drink of the  special TOSO wine prior to the Zoni. With the master of the house drinking  first, then the mistress followed by the children and the the servants  last. This wine laced with medicinal herbs and spices is believed to have  disease dispelling qualities and is similar to the wines served on New  Years by several other countries in the world. Fuku-cha is another  manditory item in their New Years (it is the tea of Good fortune) and can  either be green tea or seaweed tea which is served in tiny cups with a  pickled plum in each of the cups as a protection from illness during the  coming year. These formal ritualistic observances of the New Year are  becomming less common throughout Japan now that they have had so much of  the Western influence however in the rural areas they are still followed  religiously. It is a shame to see some of these interesting observences  gradually disappearing due to the influence of the western world.  :         Aloha.....Kapena FROM:    THEODORE SEDGWICK    (XPST31A)
