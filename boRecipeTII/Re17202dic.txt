In answer to Mellisa, I had several Tomato, Cream and Vodka sauces on the  old hard drive before the fall. Alas, this is all that remains and comes  from my daughter at Georgetown University.    Melt butter in a saute pan, and add vodka. Heat to bubbling, about 2  minutes. Add red pepper, tomatoes, salt and heat through. Add cream and  simmer gently for 10 minutes. Add cooked pasta to the pan and toss over low  heat. Serve immediately. Serves 4. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest by  CHICAGOAAA@aol.com on Mar 12, 1997
