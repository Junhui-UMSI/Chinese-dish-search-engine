Raisin Almond Biscotti
Sugar, Raisins, Slat, Eggs, Vanilla, Blanched whole almonds,, Baking soda, Double-acting baking powder, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Egg, beaten with:, Water, Cointreau, 
In a bowl combine the raisins with the Cointreau, let the raisins macerate  for 20 minutes, drain well and reserve liquid. In the bowl of an electric  mixer fitted with the paddle attachment blend the flour, the sugar, the  baking soda, the baking powder, and the salt until the mixture is combined  well. Add the eggs and vanilla, beating until the dough is formed. Stir in  the raisins and almonds.    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead it several times,  and halve it. Working on a large buttered and floured baking sheet, with  floured hands form each piece of dough into a flattish log 13 inches long  and 2 inches wide, arrange the logs at least 3 inches apart on the sheet,  and brush them with the egg wash. Bake the logs in the middle of a  preheated 325 degree F. oven for 30 minutes let them cool on the baking  sheet on a rack for 10 minutes. On a cutting board cut the logs into  3/4-inch-thick slices, arrange the biscotti, cut sides down, on the baking  sheet, and bake them in the 325 degree F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes on each  side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the biscotti to racks to cool  and store them in airtight containers.    Yield: 36 biscotti    NOTES : (Adapted from a Gourmet Magazine recipe)    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8824    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #490 by Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net>  on Mar 1, 1997.
