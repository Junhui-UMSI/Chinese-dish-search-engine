Source: From my mother with love & more, Dough/Rachel Pistol, Lemon  filling/Rina.    Dough: In ther food processor put all ingredients - but the egg. Work it  till it resemble crumbs, Add the egg and continue to work till it become a  ball. Never over mix it.    Spray 26 cm pie dish with a little with Pam, Or brush lightly with butter,  Spread with your hands the dough , prick with a fork all over the  dough.Cover with nylon spread ,and put in refrigerator for       15    minute or more.<<<<NOTE>>>>    Lemon Filling: In a saucepan mix together , Lemon,Water,Sugar, And corn  flour. Mix all the time and bring to boil . Boil just for another few  seconds, take off the stove.    Add the egg yolk one at a time , mixing all the time till well  blended.Cover with the lid to prevent thick skin on top. Cool slightly.  Note: You can taste and decide if you want to have it more sweet.    In a bowl Beat the white with Sugar till stiff . Take part of the stiff  white into the Lemon pudding, and with a hand whisker mix it very gently,  Pour and continue to mix gently the pudding into the whites. (This is very  important to do, so you will not break the lightness of the pudding.) and  then pour it all to the prepared pie dish.
