White Sauce
All purpose flour, White pepper, milk, Salt, Butter, 
Basic White sauce is wonderful alone on Cauliflower, broccoli, in spinach  and on brussels sprouts. I add a cup of my fave cheese, shredded, for a  wonderful cheese sauce. Use sharp cheddar, white cheddar, or pepper jack.  Lisa :O)    Melt butter in saucepan over low heat. Blend in remaining ingredients,  stirring constantly, until mixture bubbles. Remove from heat and serve  immediately. To thicken sauce, increase butter and flour by one tablespoon.  Yield: 1//2 cups    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #843 by MeLizaJane@aol.com on Oct 13, 1997
