Pickled Hard Boiled Eggs
Hard boiled eggs, Really good pickle juice, 
One of the best uses of pickle juice is to refill the pickle jar with  peeled hard boiled eggs and let them stay in the pickle juice for as long  as you can stand to wait. Cauliflower that has been cooked just slightly  and added hot to the pickle juice is also good.    Pickle juice is also good poured over hot potato chunks before making  potato salad. Dont throw out Clausens pickle juice until its all used  up!
