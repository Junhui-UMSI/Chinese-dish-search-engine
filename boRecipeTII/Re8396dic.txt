REMOVE THE ROOT END OF THE LEEKS, trim the dark green tops and reserve for  another use. Slice the light part into 1/2-inch rounds, wash well and set  aside on a plate. Heat the oil in a pot, over medium heat, and add the  leeks. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add stock, water, potatoes, nutmeg,  salt and pepper. Raise heat to high, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat  to low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and puree  the soup in batches. Place pureed soup in a pot and reheat, covered, over  low heat. To serve, place a generous dollop of sour cream in the bottom of  each soup bowl and sprinkle with chopped chives. Transfer piping hot soup  to a tureen or pitcher and pour into bowls at the table. Refrigerate soup  for up to 3 days or freeze the soup in 3-cup batches.    MICHAEL ROBERTS - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
