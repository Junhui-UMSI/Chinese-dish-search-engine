Put the couscous in a large bowl and sprinkle with the cold water to dampen  it.    Add a little more water if the couscous seems very dry but dont get it  water logged.    Put the sliced and chunked eggplant in layers on a large plate and salt  each layer well. Leave to stand for half an hour to get the bitter juices  out. Then rinse the eggplant.    "Saute" the vegetables in the ready diluted bouillon for 15 minutes in a  large pot with a lid that closes well, this takes the place of frying.    Now add the spices, boiling water and remaining bouillon cubes. Simmer for  20 minutes before adding the chickpeas. Cook for another 10 minutes.    This is dish is traditionally made in a "couscoussier", a large pot with a  strainer that fits in the top so that things can be steamed over the pot.  To improvise use a strainer or colinder that fits over the pot you are  using, though make sure that the holes arent too big, or else put a cloth  between the strainer and the pot. Put the damp couscous in the  strainer/colinder over the pot with the vegetable mixture in it, and let  the couscous steam while the mixture continues to cook for about another  half hour or until the couscous is tender and fluffy and the vegetables are  soft.    Serve the couscous first. Then serve the vegetables with a slotted spoon  over the couscous, and finally, use the remaining broth as a sort of gravy  to be poured over the top.
