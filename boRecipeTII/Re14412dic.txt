Whole Wheat Date and Nut
Water, Honey, Oats (I use quick oats), Whole wheat flour, Salt, Chopped almonds, Canola oil, Bread flour, Yeast, Chopped dates, 
The dates and almonds can be added at the beep, but I usually add them at  the very beginning for better distribution. We like this spread with cream  cheese, but its also good just as it is! I always keep the machine open at  the very beginning kneading and add flour by the tablespoon as is neaded  until its no longer sticky. Living in a high humidity climate sometimes I  need to add quite a lot when I dont cut down the liquid. Guess I should be  keeping an eye on the humidity before I begin baking! Thanks for your  recipe.  We used to live near Lancaster. Rhonda  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #294 by serge.cyr@sympatico.ca (Serge Cyr)  on Nov 12, 1997
