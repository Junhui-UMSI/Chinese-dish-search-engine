I use soymilk powder (Better than Milk Plain Light) to make  soymilk, but you can use skim milk in this recipe just as well.    In a non-stick skillet, cook the Gimme Lean, breaking up with spatula, for  about 5 minutes (add fresh onion at this point if using).  Sprinkle on  sugar and sage. Add flour and mix until flour is moistened and coats  mixture. Add milk 1/2 Cup at a time, mixing well until thickened. More or  less milk may be needed to make gravy desired consistency. Add sage, pepper  and salt to taste.    Variations:    1. Add a few crushed fennel seeds    2. Add a dash of tabasco sauce    3. Add garlic with the sausage    This is great over brown rice, whole wheat ribbon pasta, and biscuits.  I  have not yet found a low-fat vegan biscuit mix or recipe, so i use Light  Bisquick and light soymilk.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #64    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
