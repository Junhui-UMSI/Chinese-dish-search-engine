Another entry in the "Build a Better Burger Contest" sponsored by the  North American Vegetarian Society.   Since entering the contest, the contestant has reworked his recipe,  eliminating the green peppers and green beans, reducing the rolled oats to  1/2 cup, adding 1/2 cup corn meal, and replacing the seasoned salt and  vegetable broth with tamari, dijon mustard, tarragon, basil and parsley.     The recipe was entered in the contest without the vegan yeast cheese.   Submitted by Keith Zimmer, Milan, MI     From _Vegetarian Voice_
