Polenta Pie - Polenta Pasticciata
Dried mushrooms, Yellow cornmeal, Stalk celery, Butter, Italian-style sausages, Ripe tomatoes, Salt, Carrot, Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, Onion, Bacon, 
Soak the mushrooms in warm water. Peel the sausages and break them into  small pieces. Wash, seed and cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Chop the  onion, carrot, celery and bacon. Melt a bit of butter in a pan and lightly  brown the chopped condiments. Add the mushrooms, the sausage pieces and  tomatoes. Add a pinch of salt. Cook for 10 minutes over moderate heat,  adding a bit of water, if necessary. Or dry white wine can be used instead.    Preheat the oven to 350 F. Prepare the polenta and butter a mold. When the  mush is well-cooked, put some of it into the bottom of the mold, pour over  a layer of sauce, sprinkle with grated Parmesan and dot with butter.  Continue in the same way until all of the ingredients have been used.  Finish with a layer of sauce, sprinkled with a large quantity of grated  cheese and dotted with butter. Bake in a 350 F. oven until the pie has  developed a golden crust.    Posted to Kitmailbox Digest  by GAdams1350@aol.com on Apr 23, 1997
