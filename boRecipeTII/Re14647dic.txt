>>From: Claudia Parras (tamale@aloha.net)    The very idea of healthier (less fat and no cholesterol) mandelbread made  me pause, but I made this recipe as gift for a friend who is concerned  about such things and misses the traditional sort. I found the taste to be  pleasant, and I hope that you will also find it so!    Preheat oven to 350 F. Coat two baking sheets with a nonstick vegetable  spray.    In a medium bowl, beat oil, sugar, egg substitute and extracts. Add flour  and baking powder and mix well. Stir in nuts and chocolate chips, if using.  Batter will be stiff and sticky.    Divide batter into 4 parts. Lay out in four thin loaf shapes, 10 inches  long by 1-1/2 inches.    Spread the pieces out so they do not touch and continue baking until the  pieces are brown, about another 10 to 12 minutes, being careful they do not  burn on the bottom. Makes 40.
