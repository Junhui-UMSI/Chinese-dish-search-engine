While visiting Sams yesterday I found a new bread book entitled "Farm  Journals Homemade Breads". It has some outstanding looking bread recipes  in it and I thought I might post a couple. Here ya go - Enjoy! Dot    Gradually stir corn meal into water, let stand 5 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Stir in warm milk and 2 T shortening, cool until very warm  (120 - 130 Deg F).    In large bowl, stir together yeast, brown sugar, salt and 2 cup flour.    Using mixer at low speed, gradually beat corn meal mixture into yeast  mixture. Increase speed to medium, beat 2 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cup flour,  beat 2 minutes.    Stir in enough additional flour to make a soft dough. On lightly floured  surface, knead until smooth and elastic -- about 8 minutes. Dough will be  slightly sticky.    Place in greased bowl - turning once. Cover with towel, let rise until  doubled, about 50 minutes.    Punch down, knead on floured surface until no longer sticky, about 30  seconds. Divide dough in half and let rest, covered, 10 minutes.    Shape dough into 2 loaves and place in greased 9x5x3" loaf pans. Cover and  let rise until double - about 35 minutes.    Bake in 375F oven 35 - 40 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and  sound hollow when tapped. Immediately remove from pans, brush tops with  shortening, cool on racks.
