1. Adjust oven rack to low center position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Sift  flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in medium bowl.    2. In bowl of electric mixer or by hand, beat butter until creamy. Add  sugars; beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes with electric mixer, stopping to  scrape down bowl as necessary. Beat in peanut butter until fully  incorporated, then eggs, one at a time, then vanilla. Gently stir dry  ingredients into peanut butter mixture. Add ground peanuts; stir gently  until just incorporated.    3. Working with 2 Tablespoons dough at a time (see illustration 1, below),  roll into large balls, placing them 2 inches apart on a parchment-covered  cookie sheet. Following illustration 2, below, press each dough ball with  back of dinner fork dipped in cold water to make criss-cross design. Bake  until cookies are puffed and slightly brown along edges, but not top, 10 to  12 minutes (they will not look fully baked). Cool cookies on cookie sheet  until set, about 4 minutes, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely.  Cookies will keep, refrigerated in an air-tight container, up to 7 days.

Be sure to grind the peanuts, since whole, and even chopped  peanuts tend to slip out of the dough. If using unsalted butter, increase  salt to 1 teaspoon. Keep finished cookies refrigerated in airtight  container. To restore just baked chewiness, wrap a cookie in a sheet of  paper towel and microwave for approximately 25 seconds. Cool before  serving.
