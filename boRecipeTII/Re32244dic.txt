Barbecued Squid with Hot Dipping Sauce (Squid Sate)
garlic, Sugar, Fish sauce, Juice of 1 lime, Coconut milk, Squid, Peanuts, Cayenne, 
No country of origin, but Im betting on Vietnam this time, mainly  from the dip.    Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor.    Boil 1 1/2 cups water.  Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated  coconut.  Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1  minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth.  Marinate  the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the  garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid.    To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive,  combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne.    Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side.  When brown, turn  over and barbecue 3 minutes more.    Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce.    This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties  such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets  into large squares.    This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.
