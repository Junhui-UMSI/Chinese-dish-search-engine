The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one way  to describe an after shave. Most after shaves act as astringents; they help  firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied immediately after shaving.  Many after shaves contain alcohol, which possesses antibacterial abilities,  helping to prevent infections of nicks or shaving cuts. It also should  contain glycerine and/or other ingredients known to be beneficial to skin  care. Glycerine will help counter the drying effects on the skin, and the  chafing and irritation that can develop with dry skin. *Most drug stores  contain all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb and health food shops  carry the essential oils.  Posted to bbq-digest V5 #735 by RockMc <RockMc@aol.com> on Dec 1, 1997
