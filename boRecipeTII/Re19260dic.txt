1.  To make the filling, heat the oil in a karahi(wok) over medium high  heat and add the cummin seeds. Let them sizzle for a few seconds.      2. Add the potatoes and green chilli and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the  turmeric and salt and, stirring occasionally, cook for 5 minutes.      3. Add the peas and the ground roasted cumin. Stir to mix. Cover, lower  the heat and cook a further 10 minutes until the potatoes are tender. Cool.      4. To make the dough, sieve together the flour and salt. Rub in the oil.  Add enough water to form a stiff dough. Knead for 10 minutes until smooth.      5. Divide into 12 balls. Roll each ball into a round of about 15cm/6"  across. Cut in half.      6. Pick up one half, flatten it slightly and form a cone, sealing the  overlapping edge with a little water. Fill the cone with 1.5 tsp of the  filling and seal the top with a little water.      7. Make all the samosas in the same way.      8. Heat the oil in a karahi(wok) over medium heat. Put as many samosas as  you can into the hot oil and fry until crisp and golden. Drain. Serve with  a chutney or your favourite chilli or tomato sauce.    Source: Mum    Posted to T.nt (sdm-marked) - Prodigys Recipe Exchange Newsletter  by "I.
