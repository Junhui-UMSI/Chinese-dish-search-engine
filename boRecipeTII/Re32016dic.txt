The secret to tender baked beans is to leave the salt out until they  are finished cooking. For some reason, salt toughens them. To pamper  your tummy, rinse off the beans when they are finished soaking in  several changes of cold water. This recipe is easy to prepare ahead  and cooks in only two hours.    1. Place the beans in a bowl, cover with cold water and soak  overnight. Drain and rinse beans very well under cold water.    2. Place the beans in a large, heavy pot. Add enough water to cover  the beans by 2". Bring water to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and  cook for 45 minutes, or until beans are tender but not mushy. Skim  off any foam that rises to the surface. Drain the beans.    3. Place the oil in a large, heavy ovenproof casserole. Add the  onions and wilt over medium-low heat until transluscent. Remove from  heat and stir in the beans.    4. Stir in the tomatoes and reserved juices along with all remaining  ingredients except the salt and pepper.    5. Bake, covered, for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 30 minutes  more. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Per serving: 327 calories, 5 grams fat, no cholesterol.
