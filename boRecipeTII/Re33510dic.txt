Suzans Potato Casserole
Hash brown potatoes ;frozen, Parmesan cheese ; for toppi, Cheese;cheddar shredded, Cream of mushroom soup, Sour cream, Onion powder, 
Mix  all ingredients together except Parmesan.   Put into greased casserole  (approx.  13 x 9).   Sprinkle Parmesan over top...probably about 1/4 cup or  so.    Bake for 1 hour at 400 degrees. This can be doubled easily. Also can be  prepared in advance and baked just before serving. I hope you enjoy it.  Valerie---FROM:    VALERIE WOLF   (XXNX27A)
