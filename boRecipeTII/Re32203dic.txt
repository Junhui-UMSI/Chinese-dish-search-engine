Chef Roelant garnished this dish with fresh fruit and parsley. Combine  first 5 ingredients in a bowl; stir well. Arrange scallops in a single  layer in a 1-1/2-quart casserole; spoon about 6 tablespoons ketchup mixture  over scallops. Cover and chill 30 minutes. Combine water and next 7  ingredients (water through pepper) in a medium saucepan, and bring to a  boil; gradually stir in couscous. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 5  minutes. Add oil, and fluff with a fork. Uncover scallops, and broil 6  minutes on each side or until done. Spoon couscous mixture onto individual  plates; top with scallops, and drizzle with remaining ketchup mixture.  Garnish with fresh fruit slices and parsley, if desired. Yield: 4 servings  (serving size: 1 cup couscous, 4 scallops, and 1 tablespoon sauce).
