Banana Bungalow
Bananas; peeled, Chocolate sprinkles, Frozen whipped topping;, Chocolate cake mix, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. Pour the prepared cake batter onto a 10" x 15"  rimmed baking sheet or jelly-roll pan that has been coated with nonstick  baking spray. Bake for 22 to 24 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick  inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool, then invert onto  large platter. Cut crosswise into 3 sections, each measureing 5" x 10".  Reserve 1 cup whipped topping for the frosting. Spread some of the  remaining whipped topping over the middle section of cake, completely  covering it. Lay 2 bananas parallel to each other over the whipped topping.  Spoon more whipped topping over the bananas, then place the third banana on  top. Cover with the remaining whipped topping. Gently bring up the 2 side  pieces of cake from the outer edges to form the bungalow roof. Frost the  cake with the reserved whipped topping, then cover with the sprinkles.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, then slice and serve.    BUSTED BY MEG ANTCZAK 1/21/98    Recipe by: MR FOOD    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Meg Antczak <meginny@frontiernet.net> on  Jan 22, 1998
