Have you ever tried a cranberry pie? I hadnt, and its not likely that  you have either. In Colonial times this was a populartreat, using the  native American berries.      Preheat the oven to 400?. Wash and pick over cranberries; drain  thoroughly. Chop cranberries and mix with sugar and cornstarch. Mix egg and  almond extract and combine with cranberries. Line a 9-inch pie plate with  half the pastry. Add cranberry mixture. Cover with strips of pastry  arranged in a lattice, and seal edges. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350?  and continue baking about 35 minutes, or until cranberries are soft and  pastry is browned.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
