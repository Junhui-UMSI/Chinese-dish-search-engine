Apple-Cinnamon-Whole-Wheat-Oatmeal Bread
Whole-wheat flour, Honey, Cinnamon, Oats (I used quick), Orange juice concentrate, Yeast, Diced apple, Wheat gluten, Apple juice, Salt, 
Mix in the order recommended by your breadmaker.  This uses the  powdered-milk white/wheat setting on the Black & Decker. This makes a  good-sized loaf, and it has a lovely aroma. The apple pieces are  indistinguishable at the end (the bread maker must blend them up).    Source: my adaptations from the cookbook that came with the machine.
