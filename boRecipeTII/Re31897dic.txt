Tabouli (variation on the Moosewood Cookbook).  (Attention - those with  overstocked lemons, I usually at *least* double the lemon juice in this...)    In a large bowl, mix bulgur, boiling water and salt.  Let stand about 20  minutes until the water is all soaked up.  Mix together lemon juice,  garlic, olive oil and mint. Stir this into the wheat, then refrigerate for  about 3 hours.    Toss in remaining ingredients.  Garnish w/ olives (if you want - I  dont...) and feta cheese (lots!!).    This makes a bunch - enough for side dishes & some lunches for 2 people for  about 1/2 week.  Refrigerate.
