Vegetable Stock:  ================         At least 8 - 10 hours before serving, place all of the ingredients in  a stockpot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a boil, skim, and simmer  for 20 minutes.         Strain the liquid, return to heat, and reduce it by one-fourth. Skim  carefully during the reducing process.  Remove from heat and measure the  remaining liquid.  For each 2 cups of hot stock, add 1 tablespoon gelatin  dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold water.  Add salt and white pepper to  taste.         Pour into a flat pan and chill for 2 - 3 hours.    For the Garnish:  ================         Use any combination of 4 or 5 cold fresh seasonal vegetables, cut  thinly and shredded.        Remove the jelly from the refrigerator half an hour before serving. Let  it stand at room temperature to warm slightly (if it is served too cold,  the flavor will be lost).         To serve, scatter small amounts of vegetable garnish in soup bowls.  Break jelly into irregular pieces with a fork and place on top of garnish.  For each person, use 1/2 cup.  Top with fresh herbs, such as chives, basil,  or tarragon.         If available, add edible flowers such as borage, onion, or nasturtium  petals.  Serve within 5 minutes, since jelly begins to lose form if held  longer.
