Easy Light Wheat Bread (For the Bread Maker)
Honey, Whole wheat flour, white flour, yeast, Salt, Warm water, 
add ingredients to your machine in the order it calls for.    if using the bread maker for the whole cycle, bake on the wheat bread  cycle. i prefer not to use the machine to bake my loaves...they are  awkardly shaped and hard to cut, so i use the machine only for the  kneading. :)    so, for dough, set the machine on the dough cycle. it should go through its  first rise. after cycle is done, turn dough out on to a floured surface and  knead for a few minutes. put it into a bowl lightly sprayed with non-stick  spray and let rise for 1 hour, til doubled. put dough blob into a loaf pan  and bake at 450 for 10 minutes, then lower oven temp to 350 and bake about  30 minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. this makes a smallish  loaf that freezes well when sliced.
