Vegeburgers
carrots, Bread, Garlic, Green lentils, parsley, Seasoning, Onion, wholemeal flour, Egg, 
Boil lentils for 20 minutes in water, drain, and mash gently - not too  hard, as you want some of them to stay whole. While they are cooking, peel  and grate the carrots, make the bread into crumbs, and finely chop the  onion, parsley and garlic.  Mix these and the seasoning with the mashed  lentils, and bind together with egg. Form into burgers or rissoles or  whatever you call the things, coat with flour - I still dont know if this  is necessary - and cook under the grill (broiler) for 5 minutes each side.  *Tomato sauce made like this: 1 onion 1 clove garlic 1 tbs tomato puree  (paste) 1 tin tomatoes A little extra water Seasoning. Microwave onion and  garlic for about 3 minutes; transfer to saucepan with the tomato puree,  stir, add tinned tomatoes and a little water, season, bring to the boil and  simmer for about 15 minutes.  If its a bit liquid, boil harder to reduce -  get it to the sort of consistency you would like, bearing in mind you have  brown rice to moisten!
