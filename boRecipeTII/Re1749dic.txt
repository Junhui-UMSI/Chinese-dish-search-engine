Recipe by: The Bread Machine Cookbook V - ISBN 1-55867-093-9 Add almonds at  the beep or appropriate time for your machine. (There is a misprint in the  book. They say add cherries at beep, but if you wait that long you will  have no moisture to mix the dough.) CYCLE: sweet, white; no timer SETTING:  light    NOTES : Pack cherries tightly in a measuring cup. You may try to double         the yeast for a taller loaf. This is a low rising, dense loaf.
