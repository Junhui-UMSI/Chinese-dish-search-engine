Poppyseed Shortcakes
Sugar, Heavy cream, Heavy cream, Flour, Unsalted butter; cold, Baking Powder, ***Garnish, Poppyseeds, Salt, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350. Combine the flour, 1/4 cup of of sugar, poppyseeds,  baking powder, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer. Using the paddle  attachment on low speed, add the cold butter and mix until it is the size  of small peas. Continue to mix slowly and add 1/ 1/8 cup cream. Mix just  until the dough comes together. On a lightly floured board, roll the dough  1" thick and cut it into 6 3" circles. Brush the remaining cream on top of  the shortcakes and then sprinkle on the remaining sugar. Bake the  shortcakes for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown.  NOTES : Serve while still warm with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.       When in a hurry I ignore the garnish and simply add the extra       sugar and       cream into the dough.
