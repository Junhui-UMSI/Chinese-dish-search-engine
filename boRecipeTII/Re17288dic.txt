With a Julia Child-autographed stabbing knife, pierce the lamb in several  places and insert garlic slices and mint (or rosemary).    Gloop together the oil, vinegar, Worcestershire, paprika, salt, pepper and  sugar.  Add enough flour to thicken this muck into a paste. Rub it all over  the meat to coat.  Then roll the lamb in flour and plunk it in a pan.    Shove the pan into a 500-degree oven until the crust has hardened and  browned lightly.  Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees and bake the  lamb until done to your liking (somewhere around 30 minutes a pound).    Boy, thats going to be good.  But if anybody reaches for seconds, hit them  on the fist with the spatula.  You want to save some leftovers to serve  with this:    Sauce:  Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, mustard, curry and  paprika and stir-cook a few minutes.    Add the broth and heat, stirring until it is smooth and has thickened.  Gloop in the sherry.  Serve over rewarmed slices of lamb.
