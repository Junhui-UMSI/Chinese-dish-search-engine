Bachas Moroccan Salad Dressing
olive oil, Salt & black pepper, Garlic cloves, chopped, Lemon juice*, Italian parsley, chopped, Hot red pepper***, Cilantro, chopped, Sweet red pepper**, 
Mix together all the ingredients & let sit for a while to allow the  flavours to marry.  Then use. * Or replace with wine vinegar ** I use  Hungarian paprika, its sweeter than Spanish *** I use cayenne. You need  the hot to contrast with the sweet.
