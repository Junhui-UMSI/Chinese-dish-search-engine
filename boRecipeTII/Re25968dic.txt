Sift the  flour, baking powder, sugar and salt into a separate bowl. Add the  cornmeal. Combine the dry ingredients with the egg-milk mixture and stir  with ONLY a FEW quick strokes. Add the bacon drippings. Cut the bacon  slices into halves or quarters. Place several pieces of bacon on the waffle  iron for each waffle and pour on batter to cover about 2/3 of the waffle  iron grid. Close the iron and bake until the steam stops. Remove the waffle  and serve with honey, molasses or corn syrup.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
