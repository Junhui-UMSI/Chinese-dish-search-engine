1. Carefully slice beef into thin bite size pieces, across the grain  of beef. Marinate beef in soya sauce, wine and salt. Shred broccoli.    2. Place oil in wok and heat to smoking point. Quickly stir-fry beef  in it, no more than 3 minutes. Remove beef to a platter and reserve.    3. Add broccoli to wok, 1/2 cup water, sugar. Turn burner to medium  high heat, cover broccoli, cook 6 minutes. Lift the cover of the wok  and stir the broccoli every so often so that it will cook on both  sides. At the end of 6 minutes, the broccoli should just be cooked  through, if it isnt, cook a minute or two more.    4. Add beef back to broccoli, stir everything together. Place in  platter.    NOTE: Pork, or chicken may be substituted, only do not remove pork or  chicken to a platter after initial stir-frying but continue to cook it  with broccoli. Beef is removed for reserve because it toughens with  prolonged cooking.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cc-wok.zip
