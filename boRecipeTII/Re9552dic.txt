My daughter Cayla wanted me to type this recipe last week and I just put  her off.  She got a good laugh a few minutes ago when she read your  request.  Here is our favorite pumpkin cookie recipe.  This recipe is one  that I contributed to the Taste of Home magazine.  It was published in the  Oct/Nov. 94 issue.   Have fun and enjoy!    In a mixing bowl, cream margarine and sugars.  Beat in egg and vanilla.  Combine flour, oats, baking soda, and cinnamon; stir into creamed mixture  alternately with pumpkin.  Fold in chocolate chips.  Drop by tablespoonfuls  onto greased baking sheets.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10-13 minutes or until  lightly browned.  Yield: 4 dozen.
