COMBINE THE VEAL and 4 cups broth in a 5-quart heavy pot over high heat on  top of the stove. Cover and bring to a boil. Remove any scum that comes to  the top of the pot, then add the remaining broth, the onion, celery,  carrot, salt, pepper, nutmeg and lemon. Reduce heat to low and let simmer  for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is just tender. Meanwhile, melt the butter  in a pot, over low heat, and whisk in the flour. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes  and remove from heat. Set aside until the meat is cooked. When the meat is  done, remove it from the liquid with a slotted spoon. Pick off and discard  any vegetables that cling to the veal. Place the butter-flour mixture over  medium-low heat on the stove. Strain the cooking liquid into it, whisking,  and add the sherry and cream. Discard vegetables in the strainer. Cook,  stirring, until mixture thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes. Replace the meat in  the pot and add the mushrooms and crayfish. Pour in the sauce, place the  pot, uncovered, over medium heat and cook 10 minutes. To serve, pour into a  serving dish.
