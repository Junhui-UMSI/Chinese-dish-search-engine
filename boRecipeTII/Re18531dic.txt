From: Natalie Frankel <Natalie.Frankel@mixcom.com>    Date: Wed, 10 Jul 1996 23:13:19 -0500  Ive received several requests for the recipe, so I thought Id post it to  the group since it might not be retrievable from the archives with them  down at this time. The original poster was Iggulden Christin I  4cii@qlink.queensu.ca>.  I altered the recipe by adding canned creamed corn  (which you know is just corn - there is no cream).    Preheat oven to 425 degrees f. Pam spray an 8" X 8 " cake pan or equivalent  iron skillet or other oven-proof pan and put into the oven to preheat. Mix  all ingredients, pour batter into heated pan and bake for 20 mins.    Freezes well - if it lasts that long.  Refrigerate any leftovers and serve  cold or it also improves when reheated for about 15 minutes at 350 degrees  and gets crisp. Christine likes it hot out of the oven with molasses.    fatfree digest V96 #191    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
