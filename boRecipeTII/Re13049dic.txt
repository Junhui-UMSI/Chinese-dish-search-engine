Winter Vegetable Beef Soup
Onion, Beef soup bones, Cooking tomatoes, Thyme, dried, Green peas, Ear corn, Basil, dried, Bay Leaves, Oregano, dried, Carrots, Green beans, fresh, Salt and pepper, Water, 
In a large, heavy pot, bring about 12 C of water to boil. Add beef bones,  cover and bring back to full boil. Reduce heat to low simmer. Skim  occasionally during first 30 minutes to remove scum. Cook for 3-4 hours  until meat is tender and nearly falls off of bones.    Remove bones from broth.  Remove all meat and marrow from bones and return  to the pot. Add tomatoes (including juice), onion and herbs. Simmer for 20  minutes.  Remove tomatoes, break up into quarters or smaller, and return to  the pot.  Continue to simmer.    Clean green beans and break into pieces.  Clean carrots and slice into thin  slices.  Slice kernels from ear of corn. Shell peas. Add vegetables to pot.  Simmer for 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.    NOTES:    *  A thick and hearty vegetable beef soup, this soup is almost thick enough  to be called a stew. It is great on a cold day or after skiing.    *  I prefer beef neck or shank bones over what markets call "soup bones"  which are nearly devoid of meat. Individual-serving size cans of green  beans, corn and green peas may be substituted if fresh vegetables are not  available. These are the basic vegetables I use, but I have also added  mustard greens, chinese cabbage, zucchini and yellow squash (add just 5  minutes before serving or they become mush) turnips and any other  fall/winter vegetables that look good in the market. Serve with cornbread,  sourdough or another strong flavored bread. This soup improves with age.    : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.  : Time:  Several hours of intermittent attention.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Pamela McGarvey  : UCLA Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Los Angeles, California, USA  : {hao,sdcrdcf}!cepu!pam    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
