Pina Colada Tamales
Corn husks, Brown sugar, Banana chips, almonds, Masa, Lime zest, Sweetened coconut, Pineapple-coconut juice, Fresh pineapple chunks;, Whipped cream, 
In food processor or blender, process banana chips until finely chopped.  Combine chips in small bowl with almonds and coconut.    Tear 2 corn husks into long strips; set aside (to tying the tamales).    Formatted by Karen Sonnessa <ksonness@suffolk.lib.ny.us>    To make tamales, spread 1 tablespoon masa dough in center of each corn husk  to form a rectangle, leaving sides, top and bottom of husk exposed.  Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons banana-chip mixture over masa and press in 1  pineapple chunk. Spread 1 tablespoon masa dough over filling. Fold corn  husk over filling, beginning with right and left sides and ending with  non-pointed husk bottom. Tie tamale "package" together with corn husk  strips. Make sure filling is fully enclosed and strips are securely  knotted.    Place tamales not touching each other in steamer over boiling water. Cover  and steam for 1 hour and 15 minutes over medium-high heat, adding more  water if necessary.    Meanwhile, place remaining pineapple chunks, about 1 cup, in food processor  or blender with pineapple-coconut juice and sugar; process until smooth.    To serve, cut open tamales. Spoon sauce over each; top with shipped cream,  if using, and lime zest. Makes about 20 tamales.
