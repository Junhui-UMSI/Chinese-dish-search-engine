For the dough:    Put the water in a mixing bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it. Stir until  the yeast has dissolved. Beat the egg into the yeast mixture, and set  aside.    Sift together the flour, sugar, and salt.  Add the yeast mixture. Knead  until the mix forms a ball- if too moist add a bit more flour. Knead 10  minutes more.    Roll out to an 11" square. Spread 1/2 cup butter over the surface of the  dough.  Fold the dough into thirds and wrap in a damp cloth. Refrigerate 20  minutes. Repeat this process beginning from rolling out the dough, two more  times.    While the dough is in the refrigerator the last time, you should prepare  the fillings, icings or other recipes you will need for the finished  pastries.    The following parts will give you the variety of pastries made with this  dough, and the methods.  They will be followed by additional recipes needed  to prepare the pastries.
