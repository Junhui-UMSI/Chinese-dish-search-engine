Sweet Potato Steaks
Sweet potatoes, 
This is really great.  Michelle was the first one to mention this last year  so she gets full credit (yeah, shes also pretty busy these days) Slice  sweet potatoes the long way into around 1/4" (1 cm?) slices. Brush with  steak sauce - Lea & Perrins is vegan.  Trader Joes too. Let sit for a  little while    Place on BBQ (Turn once)    The potatoes get that wonderful grill pattern on them too!    Buy potatoes that are straight and plump.  Ive done this with both orange  and yellow flesh varietes with good success.  You may even be able to use  regular potatoes...
