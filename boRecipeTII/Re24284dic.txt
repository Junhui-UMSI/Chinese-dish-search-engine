Trinidad Pepper Pot Soup
Corned beef, Worcestershire Sauce, Chicken, Onions, Dark brown sugar, Garlic, Dried red ground chili, Thyme, Pork, Water, Black Pepper, 
Combine the chicken, pork, corned beef, and water in saucepan. Cover and  cook over medium heat for 2 hours. Add the onions, garlic, chili peppers,  thyme, brown sugar, Worcestershire Sauce and black pepper and mix together.  Cover and serve hot with crusty bread or rolls.    Note: Cooked potato or noodles, shells or any pasta can be added to make  this dish a more substantial meal without the bread. I also add green peas  or green beans to this as well.
