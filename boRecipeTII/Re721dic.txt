Put chicken breasts in a single layer in a shallow glass baking dish.  Pour lemon juice over chicken. Turn chicken twice to coat it well.    2. Use a mortar and pestle to crush garlic and salt to form a smooth paste.    3. In a separate bowl, whisk together garlic paste, yogurt, olive oil, mint  and black pepper.    4. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken, turning chicken twice to coat it with  the marinade. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.    5. When ready to grill, remove chicken pieces from marinade; reserve  marinade. Grill chicken over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes on each side  (depending on thickness) until thoroughly cooked.    6. While chicken is grilling, transfer marinade to a small saucepan. Cook  over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a full boil.  Boil for 1 minute. Remove pan from heat.    7. Dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon cold water and stir it into the  sauce. Return pan to stove and cook for 1 minute over medium heat, stirring  constantly, to thicken sauce.    8. Serve chicken hot, with warm yogurt sauce spooned over each serving.    Heat Scale:  Mild    Recipe by: Chile Pepper Magazine, August 1998
