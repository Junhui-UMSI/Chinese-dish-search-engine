Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off. Combine yeast,  sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl. Set aside for 5 minutes until  foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour, butter pieces and  salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to yeast. With the processor  running, add yeast-water mixture gradually, until all of the moisture is  absorbed and the dough leaves the side of the bowl. Process for an  additional 60 seconds. Transfer dough from the workbowl to a large greased  mixing bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and place in warm off oven. Allow  to rise until doubled, approximately 1 1/2 hours.    Combine the ricotta and Parmesan. Punch down the risen dough and transfer  to a floured rolling surface. With quick, hard strokes, roll dough into a  large rectangle, approximately 1/2 inch thick. Layer one- half of the  mozzarella cheese evenly down the center leaving approximately three inches  of exposed dough on either side. Top with the ricotta mixture and  pepperoni, and the remaining mozzarella. Overlap the exposed dough over the  cheese mixture and pinch well on all sides to seal.    Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen towel  and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled, approximately  45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until loaf is well browned and  hollow sounding when thumped.                                                     -- Sam Waring
