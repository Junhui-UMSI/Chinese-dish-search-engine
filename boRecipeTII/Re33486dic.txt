Susanna Grahams Apple Preserves
Sugar, Water, 
Cook until it spins a thread. Add scant quart of peeled, sectioned apples  (Jonathan, green or unripe). Cook until transparent.    NOTE: This recipe goes back four generations, to the Chefs  Great-Grandmother. We have listed it here exactly as it was handed down to  us (recipes were less precise 100 years ago). These preserves are delicious  as is, and we have never found the likes of them on a store shelf. Feel  free to tinker with some seasoning such as cinnamon, cloves, or star anise.
