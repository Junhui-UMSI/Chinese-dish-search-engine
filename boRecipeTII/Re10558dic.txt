Quick Meal--Pasta Susanna
vegetables, Onions, Garlic, Spinach, Veggie broth, pasta, cooked, Diced tomatoes, 
In large non-stick skillet, saute onions & mushrooms & garlic.  After a  while, add spinach if frozen.  Wait until spinach thaws, then add your  other veggies.  You may want to add some veggie broth. Before theyre quite  done, add 1 can (more if you like tomatoes, or if youre feeding lots (3 or  more) people) of diced tomatoes with their sauce. Stir until tomatoes start  to warm up, then add the cooked pasta.  Stir all together. Spice as  desired.  (Basil, oregano, and dill is good.) Dont forget freshly ground  pepper.    This is quick, although it does use two pans.  It really impressed my  roommate the first time I made it.  I like it because I can use lots of  veggies, and it isnt terribly tomatoey.  Its so much lighter than pouring  regular tomato sauce on your pasta.    Source: I must confess, I adapted this recipe from my aunt, who used olive  *il and barely any veggies. Thats why I call it Pasta Susanna instead of  Pasta Donna.  :)    Posted by Susan Lehman <lehman@physics.unc.edu> to the Fatfree Digest  [Volume 17 Issue 5] Apr. 6, 1995.
