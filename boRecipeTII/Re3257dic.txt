Source: Bicycling through Provence by Sarah Leah Chase    1. Preheat the oven to 375. Generously butter a gratin dish 12 inches in  diameter and 2 to 3 inches high.    2. Combine the milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla in medium-size saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Reduce the heat to medium and boil gently to cook slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.    3. Place the flour in a medium-size bowl and using an electric mixer, beat  in the eggs one at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl often, to make a  smooth batter. Gradually beat in the warm milk mixture to form a smooth and  thin batter. Pour into the prepared gratin dish.    4. Toss the apple or pear slices with the liqueur and arrange layers over  the top of the batter; they will sink down as you work. Bake the clafoutis  until firm to the touch in the centre and lightly golden on top, 1 - 1 1/4  hours.    5. Let the clafoutis cool to lukewarm or room temperature. Serve by cutting  into pielike wedges, dusting each serving wiht confectioners sugar.    Also excellent with whipped cream.
