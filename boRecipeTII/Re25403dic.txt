Tortilla Chips
NONE, 
You will need white corn tortillas, sea salt, water, cooking spray, a  shallow dish or pie tin, a cutting board, and two baking sheets.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Spray baking sheets with cooking spray. This  will only need to be done before every other batch.    Put warm water in the shallow dish. Put a tortilla in the water for a few  seconds, then place on the cutting board. Sprinkle with sea salt. Repeat  this process until you have 6 tortillas stacked. Slice the stack diagonally  in eighths. Place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets, and bake  for about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, turn each chip over, return to  oven and bake for 5 minutes more. Remove from the oven and dump into a  large bowl to cool. When cool, store in zip-lock bags. (The chips are  usually crisper the next day.)    To make flavored chips, in place of salt use any dry flavoring, such as  Ranch flavored dressing mix, taco seasoning mix, a cinnamon and sugar  mixture, etc.    It takes about an hour to make a 3 dozen package of tortillas (which yields  18 servings) in 1 gallon-sized zip-lock bag.    NOTE: One serving, about 16 chips (or approximately 1 cup), contains about      1.5    grams of fat.  Recipe by: To Your Health!
