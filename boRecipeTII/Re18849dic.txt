Andouille Sausage Soup with Kale
celery, Red chile flakes, kale, garlic, salt and pepper, Turkey stock, olive oil, Andouille sausage, Red onion diced, Green bell pepper diced, 
I made this soup at work tonight and thought Id share the recipe since it  really is outstanding. Its adapted from a recipe I saw that used Chorizzo.  What really struck me was that the kale was really good in this soup. At my  restaurant we make a strong turkey stock for a means to heat our turkey for  hot sandwiches and turkey dinners. This is what I used but a good chicken  stock will work just as well.    Heat the oil in a 1 quart sauce pan over medium high heat. Just as the oil  starts to smoke throw in the onion, bell pepper, celery and stir the pan.  This will cool the oil but it will quickly re-heat. Keep stiring for 2 min.  then add the Andouille sausage and cook till the sausage starts to brown  around the edges and give up some of its fat to the pan. Add the garlic  and chile flakes and cook for 2 min. more stiring constantly. Add the kale  and stir till coated by everything in the pan. Add the turkey stock and  bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for 20 min. Check seasoning and  adjust with salt and pepper.
