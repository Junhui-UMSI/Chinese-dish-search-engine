Turn heat up to high and add flour blending into a smooth paste.  Add salt, nutmeg, white pepper and blend well. Add milk and parmesan  stirring to blend until the cheese melts smoothly. Remove from heat. Cheese  filling: In another bowl mix ricotta, beaten eggs, grated mozzarella cheese  and dried parsely. Mix well. Vegetables: In a skillet at high heat add some  olive oil and saute the chopped shallots for a few minutes. Reduce to  medium heat and add the chopped vegetables, except the tomato, stirring  occasionally cook uncovered for about 10 minutes. Cook the lasagna noodles  per directions, rinse and set aside to cool. Grease a deep casserole dish.  Put a little of the cheese sauce on the bottom then layer in three or four  noodles. Next a cheese sauce, then cheese filling then vegetables. Top with  a few slices of raw tomato. Repeat three times you can leave off the top  layer of tomato if you want browner cheese top. Bake in a 350 degree oven  for about 35 minutes.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #89    From the MealMaster recipe list.
