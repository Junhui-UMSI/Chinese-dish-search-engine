http://www.parentsplace.com/fun/thanksgiving/gen/0,3476,10306,00.html    This is a very easy side dish with a great color that is more savory than  hot. Commercial canned green chiles are not hot at all. For those of you  that like your dishes with a bit of zing, substitute hot pepper oil for the  olive oil. If you cannot find hot pepper oil, use a dash or two of tabasco.    Defrost the frozen corn and drain. Saute the onion in the oil for 2  minutes, then add the corn and peppers. Cook until the corn and onions are  tender. Add salt and pepper and serve hot.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on Nov 22,  1998,
