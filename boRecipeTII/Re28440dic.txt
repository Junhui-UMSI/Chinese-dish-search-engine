Baked Oatmeal
Baking Powder, Applesauce, Brown sugar; (1/2 to 1), Vanilla, Skim milk, Cinnamon, Salt, Raisins; (1/2 To 1),, ; Or Blueberries, Egg Beaters? 99% egg, Oatmeal, 
Not exactly bread, but it is very good, thought Id share it.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl.  Mix the  wet ingredients in another bowl. Stir the wet and dry ingredients together  and add the raisins or blueberries. Spread in a 9x9 pan, lightly sprayed  with nonstick spray. Bake 20-30 minutes. Serve as-is, or top with some sort  of milk.    Notes: This turns out almost like a cake.  One cup of sugar made it way too  sweet for me; Ill use 1/2 cup next time. I did use egg substitute and had  good results.    >From: Kenton Campbell <kencam@pobox.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
