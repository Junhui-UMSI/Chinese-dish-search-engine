Real Irish Stew
Potatoes, Carrots, Salt and pepper, Parsley, Mutton, Onions, 
Place meat and vegetables in saucepan and cover with cold water. Add salt  and pepper as required and flavor with a few parsley sprigs and add carrot  slices. Slowly bring to a boil and skim off the top. Simmer over a very low  heat for approximately 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Note:You can  probably substitue lamb for the mutton and not need to cook as long. Also  this kind of dish is good for buffets as soups and stews keep well and  dont suffer for extended simmering.......8-)
