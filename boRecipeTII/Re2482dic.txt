Mozzarella, olive oil, Pignoli nuts, Top round steak, Butter, Raisins, Parmesan cheese, Salt & pepper, Garlic, Parsley, 
Cut steak into 4-6 pieces and pound each piece to flatten very thin. Place  mozzarella and butter on each piece then sprinkle with Parmesan, garlic,  salt, and pepper, pignoli nuts, and parsley. Roll each piece and tie  securely with string.    Saute in olive oil with salt and pepper until steak rolls are browned on  all sides. Drop into your favorite tomato sauce and simmer 1 1/2 hours or  until fork tender. Remove from sauce, let cool slightly then carefully  remove string and serve with your favorite pasta.
