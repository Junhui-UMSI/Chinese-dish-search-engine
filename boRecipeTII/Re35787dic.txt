(The latter are not only decorative, but help the cucumbers hold their  shape after cooking.) Cut crosswise in 2-inch sections.    3. Scoop out seeds and stuff cucumbers with filling mixture, packing it in  tightly and rounding out the edges.    4. Blend cornstarch and cold water to a paste and brush overstuffed  cucumber sections to coat. Reserve remaining paste.    5. Heat oil to smoking. Add cucumber sections a few at a time; then reduce  heat and deep-fry until pale golden. Drain on paper toweling.    6. Bring remaining water to a boil. Gently lower in cucumbers; then simmer,  covered, 10 minutes over very low heat.    7. Remove cucumbers to a serving platter, leaving liquids in pan. Add  reserved cornstarch paste and tomato sauce, and stir in to thicken. Pour  sauce over cucumbers and serve. VARIATIONS:    1. For the tomato sauce, substitute soy sauce.    2.
