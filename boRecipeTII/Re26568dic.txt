Marinade:  Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.    Chicken:  Mix chicken and marinade together in a large bowl and refrig-  erate for 30 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and lightly coat chicken  with flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken  until lightly browned.  Remove from skillet and keep warm. In the same  skillet, add mushrooms, wine and 6 tablespoons of the ginger sauce. Simmer  over medium low heat for 5 minutes. Do not over cook.    In a blender, blend the first 8 ingredients together until smooth, then add  the red pepper flakes and the sesame oil and blend well. Refrigerate.    Crepes:  Beat the eggs well. Beat in the milk, salt, flour and the melted  butter until smooth, or in a blender all together. Let stand 30 minutes  before cooking. Heat a 10-inch skillet until fairly hot, but not smoking.  Film with butter.  Use a small measuring cup or pour several tablespoons of  the batter into the pan. Quickly tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly  in the pan. Cook until lightly browned. Turn with a spatula and cook other  side for about 30 seconds. Stack the crepes, using a sheet of waxed paper  between each cooked crepe.    To assemble: Remove the chicken from the warming dish and cut into  bite-sized pieces.  In the center of a cooked crepe, using a slotted spoon  put one-sixth of the cooked mushrooms, one-sixth of the cooked chicken, 1  tablespoon of the ginger sauce and a sprinkle of chopped green onion. On a  serving dish, spoon some of the juice from the cooked mushrooms and 1  tablespoon of the ginger sauce. Pull up the sides of the filled crepe to  form a bag.  Then tie the top of the crepe with a strand of the green  onion, to hold the crepe upright. Put the crepe on the juices in the  serving dish. Garnish with 1 drained peach half, several sprigs of the  watercress and some sliced green onion.                               -- Wallace Harton, New Orleans                                per Fred Towner Submitted By SAM WARING  <SAM.WARING@382-91-12.IMA.INFOMAIL.COM>  On   MON, 20 NOV 1995 145826 GMT
