Place the zucchini in a colander, sprinkle with salt, toss lightly and set  aside to drain for 30 minutes. Rinse the zucchini under cold running water,  squeeze out any excess liquid and set aside. Melt the butter in a saucepan  stir in the flour and mustard and cook over medium heat, stirring  constantly for 1  minute. Remove th saucepan from the heat, gradually stir  in the milk, then return the saucepan to the heat and cook, stirring until  the mixture boils and thickens. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and  stir in the cheeses, prepared zucchini and egg yolks. Butter 4 x 1 cup  oven-proof molds. Beat the egg whites in a medium-size bowl until they form  soft peaks, then fold into the zucchini mixture gradually. Pour the mixture  into the molds and bake in 180C oven for about 25 minutes or until the  souffles have risen and the tops are golden brown. Remove from the oven and  serve immediately with a Mixed Green Salad with Marinated Artichokes. Bon  Appetit - Exec.Chef Magnus Johansson -    Submitted By SHERREE JOHANSSON  On   1994-08-02,1013
