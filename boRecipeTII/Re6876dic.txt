Pomegranate Salad
Walnuts, Whipping cream, Vanilla, Powdered sugar, Pomegranates, Delicious apples, Salad dressing, 
Remove seeds from pomegranates. Add apples and nuts. Add powdered sugar and  vanilla to the whipping cream. Whip cream until thick. Fold in salad  dressing and then into salad.    NOTES : I have to guess on the amount of the whipping cream.  Make sure  that enough is used in the salad to coat the fruit completely. Sometimes my  mother would put in about a tablespoon of salad dressing as well--more like  the original Dixie Salad recipe.  Recipe by: Hazel Hardy    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Iris E.
