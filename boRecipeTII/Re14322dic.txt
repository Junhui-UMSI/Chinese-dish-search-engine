Whole Baked Red Snapper
olive oil, Red snapper, Salt and pepper, Extra virgin olive oil, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Rub the fish with olive oil and place it in  an oiled oval pan, gratin dish, or sheet pan. Bake for about 15 minutes per  inch of thickness at the thickest part. Check for doneness by carefully  sliding a paring knife into the back at the thickest part, gently lifting  the top fillet, and peeking inside to make sure the fish pulls away from  the bone and the flesh is opaque (but still moist) rather than translucent  and raw. Season with salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon.    Yield: 4 servings    NOTES : Recipe courtesy of Fish & Shellfish, by Jim Peterson Recipe by:  Cooking Live Show #CL8851 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #546 by Angele  Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Apr 3, 1997
