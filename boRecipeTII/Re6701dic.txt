This is a wonderful change when Im tired of the usual grains:     Bring water to a boil and stir polenta in slowly. (If youve ever made  corn meal mush, you will recognize these instructions.) Stir vigorously as  mush begins to thicken. It is done cooking when it begins to pull away from  the sides of the kettle.     Stir in balance of ingredients quickly while polenta is very hot and then  spoon entire contents into pie plate, cake pan, pyrex pans, or anything you  have handy. The pan should be large enough so that the mixture is about  3/4" thick. Refrigerate. Polenta will become solid like a heavy cake that  you can slice and lift out of the pan. Keeps in refrigerator at least a  week.     Its good cold, however I really like to heat it up in a microwave or  better yet, broil or toast in a toaster oven until heated through and maybe  slightly browned.     Serve with meal as your starch, or have with fresh fruit, salad or soup,  and some crusty french bread as a light meal. Dont worry if you dont like  cornmeal mush. This tastes nothing like that. Polenta is also a whole grain  and very nutritionally recommended. This recipe is extremely low in fat for  those who are dieting.
