The following recipe is reproduced with permission from the author of Just  Jerky, Mary Bell.  This book has several FF vegetarian recipes.  It can be  ordered by calling Mary at (507) 467-2928 or email at  drystore@polaristel.net    Not only is this a high-protein snack, use it as a cooking ingredient as  well.  Small pieces can be added to salads and used like bacon bits.  Annie  ate it as a cracker-like biscuit topped with a thin layer of cream cheese.    Mix water and oatmeal together.  Add all remaining ingredients, except soy  protein.  Stir.  Allow flavors to blend for at least 15 minutes.  Add soy  protein.  Blend together using a fork.   Marinate at least one hour.  For  longer marinating time, place in the refrigerator in a covered container or  in an airtight plastic bag. Remove from marinade container. Place in  blender and puree. What surprised me most as a result of blending was that  its color changed from brown to light cream. Form into shapes and place in  a drying environment. It dried very fast, had good flavor and was lighter  both in color and texture.
