Pumpkin Flan 2
Salt, Canned pumpkin pure, Cinnamon whipped cream, Sugar, Ground ginger, Cinnamon, Ground allspice, Eggs, Heavy cream, 
In a small skillet combine 2/3 cup of the sugar with 1/4 cup water and  bring the mixture to a boil, stirring and washing down any sugar crystals  clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in cold water until the sugar is  dissolved. Cook the syrup, swirling the skillet, until it is a deep  caramel, pour it into a 2-quart glass    loaf pan, tilting the pan to coat the bottom evenly, and let the caramel  harden.    In a bowl beat the eggs with the remaining 2/3 cup sugar, beat in the  pumpkin puree, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cream, and pour the  custard into the loaf pan. Set the loaf pan in a deep baking pan, add  enough hot water to the baking pan to reach halfway up the sides of the  loaf pan, and bake the flan in the middle of a preheated moderate oven (350  degrees F) for 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the  center comes out clean. Let the flan cool and chill it, covered, overnight.  Run a thin    knife around the edge of the loaf pan, invert a platter over the pan,    and invert the flan onto the platter. Serve the flan, cut into slices, with  the cinnamon whipped cream.
