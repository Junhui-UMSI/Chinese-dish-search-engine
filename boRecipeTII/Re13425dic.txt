Yeast Pancakes
Oatmeal, Whole-grain wheat flour, Active dry yeast, Water -- warm, 
Mix dry ingredients together. Add the water. Mix. Allow to rise in a warm  place until nearly double in volume (15-60 minutes). Cook on a non-stick  griddle over medium heat. (Flatten the pancakes with the back of a spoon,  if necessary.) Turn once when bubbles appear.    HELPFUL HINTS: This recipe can easily be varied by changing the types of  flour and cereals used. Try adding mashed banana or applesauce to the  batter. It adds an interesting flavor and the batter will rise faster.
