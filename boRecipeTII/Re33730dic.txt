In a large mixing bowl combine the cabbage, vinegar, salt and sugar,  tossing to mix well. In a heavy 4 to 5 quart (4 to 5 liter) casserole melt  the lard or bacon fat over moderate heat. Add the apples and chopped onions  and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until the apples are  lightly browned. Add the cabbage, the whole onion with the cloves, the bay  leaf, and the boiling water. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring  occasionally, and reduce the heat to its lowest possible point . Cover and  simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Check occasionally to make sure the cabbage is  moist, adding a few tablespoons of water if necessary. When the cabbage is  done there should be almost no liquid left in the casserole. Before serving  remove the onion and bay leaf, and stir in the wine and currant jelly.  Serves 4 to 6.    Bon appetit from the Chef and staff at World Wide Recipes    NOTES : This recipe tastes great at any time of year, but we particularly  enjoy it on a cold winter night. Our version of this German classic can be  made vegetarian by substituting the lard or bacon fat with vegetable or  olive oil.
