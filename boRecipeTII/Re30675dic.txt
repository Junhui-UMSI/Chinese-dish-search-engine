This recipe is very popular in the North of Veracruz and the following is  my mothers recipe for tamales.    Cook the  pork in water and when it is cooked chop it finely like ground  hamburger.  Puree the rest of the ingredients of the picadillo, fry in oil,  and when it is reduced add the chopped pork and mix.  You can add if you  want one tsp raisins, 6 chopped olives, and 1 tsp capers. This is the  stuffing you will now stuff your tamales with.    In a big sauce pan put the masa and all of the ingredients except the coron  husks.  With your hands mix everything.  Wash the corn husks and soak them  for 10-15 minutes. Then take the husks out of the water and they are ready  to be filled with the tamale dough. One tablespoon of the picadillo filling  goes in the middle of the tamle dough in the husk. Spread the dough in the  middle of the husk and put the picadillo in the middle of this dough. Then  fold the tamale sides first and then the skinny end and then the other end  last. It is best to steam the tamales in a pan suspended in a larger pan of  water for 1 hour covered.    Serve with your favorite red salsa if you want or they are good by  themselves. Buen Provecho!!!!!    YOLY@DELPHI.COM (YOLY HUGHSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
