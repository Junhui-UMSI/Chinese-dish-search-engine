Hindus who migrated to the West Indies in the 19th century introduced their  spice blends to the islands, and curries are now found throughout the  region.    Dry roast all the whole spices for about 5 minutes. Cool, then grind and  blend with the ginger and turmeric. In an airtight jar, the powder will  keep for 3-4 months.
