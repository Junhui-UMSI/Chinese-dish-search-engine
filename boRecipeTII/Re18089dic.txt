I had some a wonderful rice dish at a place called Everything Yogurt, here  in the Washington DC area.  I decided to try making my own version, and it  turned out pretty good. Note: this is not a lowfat recipe, though you could  probaby try it without the oil.     Cook the rice according to the directions on the package.  I steam my rice  in a steamer, but its up to you.  While the rice is cooking, get all your  veggies chopped and ready.  When the rice is done, put the oil in a good 10  inch fry pan.  Add the veggies and saute for just long enough to get them  hot. Place the rice in a big bowl, then add the veggies on top. Pour soy  sauce over top and, if you like, more olive oil to taste. Mix gently till  the rice and veggie s are evenly mixed. Serve hot with good french bread.  Its a meal in itself!    M20441@MWVM.MITRE.ORG    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
