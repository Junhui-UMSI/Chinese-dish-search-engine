On a rack in a broiling pan broil pork 6 inches from heat source until  rare, 5 to 6 minutes; transfer to 3-quart saucepan. Add water, vinegar, soy  sauce, garlic, and pepper and stir well to combine; bring to a boil over  high heat.  Reduce heat, cover, and let simmer until pork is fork tender,  30 to 40 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to plate; set aside.  Increase heat to high and cook pan juices, stirring occasionally, until  liquid is reduced by half; remove from heat and reserve.    In a 10-inch nonstick skillet heat oil over medium-high heat; add pork  cubes and cook, turning meat frequently, until well browned on all sides, 4  to 5 minutes. Add reserved pan juices and stir well; cook until sauce is  heated, about 1 minute.
