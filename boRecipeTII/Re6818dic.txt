from THE COMPLETE BOOK OF MEXICAN COOKING, by Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz    Heat the lard or oil in a large skillet, and saute the chicken pieces a few  at a time, until golden. Remove to a heavy, flameproof casserole that has a  lid. Combine the onion, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, tomato,  prepared chiles, salt and pepper to taste, sugar, vinegar, and a little  stock in the electric blender and blend, a small amount at a time, to a  coarse puree.    Cook the mixture in the oil remaining in the skillet for five minutes,  stirring constantly. Add the stock and pour over the chicken pieces. Cover,  and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender when pierced  wit a fork. Remove the casserole lid for the final 15 minutes of cooking.  The sauce should be very thick, almost coating the meat.    Serve with lettuce, olives, capers, avocado slices, and serrano chiles on  the side.    Serves 6.    (My Note: You can probably make this in the food processor.) Posted to  EAT-L Digest 03 Apr 97 by Peggy Makolondra <pmakolon@MAIL.WISCNET.NET> on  Apr 3, 1997
