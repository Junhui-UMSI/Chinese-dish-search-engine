Sweet Waldorf Salad and Fruit Dip
Raisins, Grapes, Cream cheese, Apple, Marshmallow cream, Whipped cream, Nuts, 
In a large bowl, combine marshmallow cream and cream cheese with mixer. Set  aside. Fold apples, grapes, raisins, nuts (optional) into whipped cream.  Fold in cream cheese mixture. ENJOY!    *Mix fruit with Fruit Fresh prior to mixing to help preserve fruit.    **Using just the marshmallow cream/cream cheese mix as a fruit dip is  wonderful. Core out a pineapple and place mixture inside with fruit around  it on a plate for a nice party platter.
