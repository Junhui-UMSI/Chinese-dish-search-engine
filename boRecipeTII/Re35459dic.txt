MAKES 40 to 50 STRIPS, Flank steak, Ground thyme, Salt, Black pepper, Vinegar, Worcestershire Sauce, Onion, Bay Leaves, garlic, Cloves, Dry Red Wine, Soy sauce, 
Trim fat and gristle from flank steak. Cut meat with grain into very thin  slices (partially freezing first makes slicing easier). Combine onion,  thyme, bay leaves, salt, garlic, pepper, cloves, vinegar, wine,  Worcestershire sauce & soy sauce. Pour marinade over steak strips to cover  and let stand in refrigerator about 15 hours. Squeeze marinade from strips  by rolling meat with rolling pin. Place meat on baking sheets or directly  on oven rack and dry in 175F oven for 9 hours, turning once. If using rack, place over foil to catch drippings.
