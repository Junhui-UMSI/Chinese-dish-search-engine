( Bread Mix )
Instant nonfat dry milk., Salt, Sugar, Bread flour; (5 lbs), 
I have my own homemade "best bread mix".  After the initial mixing which  only takes a few minutes, the rest is as easy as the store bought.    Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Stir together to distribute  evenly.  Put in a large airtight container. Label. Store in a cool, dry  place.  Use within 6 to 8 months. Makes about 22 cups of mix.
