saute onion and garlic in butter until the onions become transparent. Add  chopped potatoes, broccoli, broth, salt, pepper and red pepper. Heat to  boiling and simmer for about a half hour. Pour the mixture (about 1/3rd at  a time) into the blender and pulse six or seven times for each batch. Place  blended soup in Crockpot and add half and half and nutmeg. Heat on low for  another half hour and then let sit until dinner. Taste for seasoning;  garnish and serve warm, not hot. This is also good as a cold soup. This is  a great soup. It came to me from my friend, Pinky Thomas, on Maui. While my  daughter, Jonelle, attended school at Seabury Hall, Pinky often played  surrogate mom to her. This was one of Jonelles favorites. Pinky always  used beef broth; I use chicken. I add another potato to Pinkys one potato  and I also add a clove of garlic. Finally I add real crumbled bacon OR real  bacon bits for a garnish, along with a couple of tiny cooked broccoli  flowerets. Enjoy!
