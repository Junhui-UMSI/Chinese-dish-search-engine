Pizza Fritta - Fried Pizza
Anchovy fillets, Leavened bread dough, Primosale or other fresh, Onions; tender (up to 3), Olive oil or lard, Salt, 
Work the lard or olive oil into the leavened dough, divide into six parts  and leave to rise again for a couple of hours. Press out the pieces of  dough to form little discs which you will fill with a littl chopped onion,  cheese slices and pieces of anchovy. Fold each disc over onto itself and  press the edges well together with your fingers dampened in water. Fry in  hot oil.    Variation: at Trapani, another type of pizza is made with leavened dough.  Spread the dough over the bottom of an oiled baking tray or dish and brush  the surface with oil. Season with salt, pepper, 3 chopped cloves of garlic,  oregano and rosemary. Bake for 20 minutes in a hot oven.    Recipe by: Sicilian Cookery    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1048 by Lisa Minor <lisa@cybermill.com> on  Jan 27, 1998
