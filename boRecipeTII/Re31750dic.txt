Crumble two macaroons into each of eight 1-cup parfait or sherbet  glasses. Set aside.      In a large chilled bowl, combine the Madeira, lemon juice, sugar, lemon  peel, cinnamom and almond extract, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Pour  in the cream and beat with a whisk or rotary beater until it forms stiff  peaks on the beater when it is lifted from the bowl. Pile the cream on top  of the macaroons and chill for at least 30 minutes before serving. Source:  Time-Life Books "Foods of the World: The Cooking of the British Isles"
