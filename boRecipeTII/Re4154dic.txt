Cut large cucumber lengthwise in quarters, then in 1" long pieces.    Combine cucumber, garlic, if desired, and salt in a glass bowl. Cover with  ice cubes.  Let stand in a cool place at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain  well.    Combine vinegar, water, dill seed and crushed red pepper in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil.  Add drained cucumbers, return to boil. Cover and cook 2  min. Remove garlic cloves. Spoon into hot sterilized jars. Wipe jar rims.  Seal.    MY NOTE:  this recipe did not call for processing in a hot water bath so I  made 1/2 batch and kept them in the fridge. Similar recipe in Bernardin  Guide to Home Preserving calls for processing 10 minutes at altitudes up to     1000    ft.
