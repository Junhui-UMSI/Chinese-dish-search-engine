Wash the beans and rice. Combine with water in a saucepan and cook for 45  minutes - beans will begin to pop.    Meanwhile saute the vegetables in the oil until tender.    Add the spices to the vegetables and simmer until the beans are done.    Combine the vegetables and the beans and cook 15 minutes.    Place in a dish and melt the cheese over the top.    Serve hot.    NOTES : This is the original recipe from the Golden Temple of Conscious  Cookery in Washingotn, D.C. It makes a large amount, so the recipe can be  halved, or even quartered and it still works out well. I like more  vegetables than the original calls for, so I usually double the amount  there.
