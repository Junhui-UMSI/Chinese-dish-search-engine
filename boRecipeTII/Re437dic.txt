Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until cake  springs back when lightly depressed. Place on rack.    Grate the rind of the lemons. Extract the juice. Mix confectioners sugar,  lemon juice and rind (a blender does a nice job). Drizzle over hot cake.  Pierce top of cake generously with a fork. Let cool and mellow.    This cake is so moist that one eats it with a fork. It makes a pretty  dessert buffet presentation when cut into squares, put into pastel paper  muffin papers, and arranged on a large platter. Assorted grapes are a good  accompaniment.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
