For tostado shells, place tortillas in a single layer directly on the  middle oven rack. Bake in a 350 oven about 6 minutes, turning halfway  through baking time, or till golden and crisp. (If tortillas bubble during  baking, puncture the bubble with a fork.) Set aside and cover to keep warm.    Meanwhile, in a 10 inch skillet cook and stir chicken and chili powder over  medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes or till chicken is no longer pink. Stir in  salsa. Set aside; keep warm.    Drain beans, reserving liquid. In a small saucepan stir beans over low heat  till heated through. With a potato masher or fork, mash beans adding enough  reserved bean liquid to make spreadable consitency. Heat through.    To assemble, place a warm tortilla on each dinner plate. Spread with a thin  layer of beans. Top with beans with some of the chicken mixture, pimiento,  lettuce, radishes, cheese, olives, sour cream (if desired), and green  onion. Garnish with avocado, if desired. Makes 4 servings.    Recipe by: Better Homes & Gardens Cooking for Today--Chicken    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #995 by L979 <L979@aol.com> on Jan 8, 1998
