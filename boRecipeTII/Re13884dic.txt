Wiltons Royal Icing
Meringue powder, Water, Confectioners sugar, 
Combine all ingredients. Beat approximately 5 minutes. To prevent drying be  sure to cover bowl of icing with a damp cloth. Store in airtight container.  Any bit of shortening will break down this icing into a thin, soupy  mixture, so be sure your utensils are completely greaseless.    Recipe by: Wiltons Cake Decorating Book.
