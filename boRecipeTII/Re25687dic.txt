Peel the tomatoes, remove their hard  parts and blend them with the onion and garlic plus 1/4 cup of chicken  stock.    On one spoon of oil, fry the puree for 2 minutes. Lower the heat and cook  for another 5 minutes, until the puree get thicker or changes in colour.    Add the remainder chicken stock and epazote. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to boil and cook at medium heat for 15 minutes.    Cut the tortillas in halves, and then each half in thin strips. Add 1cm of  oil in a small pan. When it is hot, add the strips --few at a time-- and  fry them for 3 minutes or until they are golden, flipping them once. Take  out and remove excess oil. (It is important that the tortillas are dry, if  you can not leave them drying the day before, put them in your oven at 120  Celsius for one hour).    Cut the chiles in rings of 1cm and remove the seeds. Fry them in oil for  one minute or until crunchy.    Five minutes before serving, heat the soup, add the fried tortillas.  Decorate each bowl with chile rings and avocado. Add cheese.    Leave rest of avocado, chiles, cream and limes on the table for extra  garnish.
