In saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let stand for 5 minutes or until  softened.  Heat over medium-low heat for 1 minute or until dissolved.    Meanwhile, in heatproof bowl, whisk together eggs, egg yolks, milk and  sugar.  Place over saucepan of simmering water; cook, whisking constantly,  for 20 minutes or until thick enough to coat back of spoon. Remove from  heat; stir in gelatin, vanilla and nutmeg. Place plastic wrap directly on  surface; refrigerate for 2 hours or until thick enough to mound on spoon.    Line side of 10 inch springform pan with parchment or waxed paper. Arrange  about 12 cookies, flat side down, over bottom of pan. Break remaining  cookies into pieces; fill in spaces to cover bottom completely. Mix 1/2 cup  of the mincemeat with rum; spread over cookies. Whisk chilled egg mixture.  In separate bowl, whip cream; fold into egg mixture. Spoon over cookies,  smoothing top.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap; refrigerate for about 4  hours or until set.    Drain juice from oranges into small saucepan; whisk in cornstarch. Stir in  remaining mincemeat; bring to a boil, stirring. Reduce heat and simmer,  stirring, for 2 minutes or until slightly thickened. Stir in oranges (Cake  and sauce can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours; gently reheat sauce to  serve.) Pour over each serving of cake.
