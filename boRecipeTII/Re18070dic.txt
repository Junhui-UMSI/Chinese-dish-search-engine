Veggie Fajitas
Cumin, Hot green peppers, Water, Onions, Crushed garlic or garlic, Broccoli, Red and green bell peppers, [insert other favorite, Oregano, Garlic, Fresh ground black pepper, Cauliflower, MARINADE, Soy sauce, 
Mix the soy sauce, cumin, oregano and crushed/powdered garlic and marinate  all vegetables in it for a few minutes. In the meantime, heat a wok or iron  skillet (it makes a big difference to me if its iron) so water boils away  instantly. If you wish, coat the surface with a little oil, but I rarely  find this necessary (youll notice theres no oil in the marinade... fewer  calories). Toss in the vegetables with a tbspn water, shake the pan, and  cover for a few minutes, until the broccoli is bright green. Stir the  vegetables -- I like to get them a little burned on the fringes. Add black  pepper just before you remove the skillet from heat. The important thing is  to prevent the veggies from becoming too tender -- crispness is essential.     Wrap in tortillas and add anything else -- salsa(!), guacamole, cheese or  sour cream if desired. They takes ten minutes to make and I usually eat way  too many of them. :-)    AT986@FREENET.CARLETON.CA    (WARD TOMLINSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
