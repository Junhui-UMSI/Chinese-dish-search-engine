Combine 1 cup of  liquid with onion, molasses, tomato sauce, salt, mustard, pepper, and  Worcestershire sauce. Mix with drained beans in slow-cooking pot. Cover and  cook on low for 10 to 12 hours. Add sausage the last hour of cooking.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
