Wendys Roast Beef
Freshly ground Pepper, to, Garlic cloves (up to 3), Sliced onions (up to 2), Shoulder or minute steak, 
A day before roasting (or longer if convenient) wipe the roast and put  garlic slivers in slits all over the roast. Also rub the outside with  garlic and the pepper. Put in a bowl surrounded by the onion slices and  refrigerate covered(If not your refrigerator will smell to hight heaven)    The day you are cooking it: Take the roast out of the refrigerator and let  it come to room temperature. (be careful of this if you live in a hot  climate or it is summer up north) Preheat the oven to 450 Degrees F.    Put the roast and onions,(add more if you like) into an uncovered roasting  pan and put it in the preheated oven. After 15 minutes turn the oven down  to 350 degrees F and roast 15-20 minutes a pound depending on your taste.  The minute steak roast, being long and skinny, needs less time than the  broad shoulder roast. Use a meat thermometer to test doneness. Do not over  cook. If some in you family like well done and some rare, give the outer  slices to the well doners and the center slices to the rarers. When it is  done, put it on a platter and let the juices regroup before slicing.  deglaze the pan with wine, water or beef broth, making sure to scrape all  the goodies. Adjust seasonings. I often add some powdered onion in place of  salt to bake a good gravy. You wont have a lot of gravy, but ,in the words  of Spencer Tracy about Katherine Hepburn, what you have is churce(chioce).    This is truely my favorite dinner and I usually serve it when one of my  children comes to visit after a long while away. I usually use the shoulder  roast, as it is less expensive.
