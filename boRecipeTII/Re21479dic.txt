1. For dough, sprinkle yeast and sugar into warm water in small bowl; let  stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. 2. Mix flour, oil and salt in a large  bowl; make a well in the center and add yeast mixture. Stir to form a soft  dough, adding more flour if necessary. Turn onto a floured board and knead  until dough is supple and elastic, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large  bowl, cover and let rise in a warm spot until dough has doubled, about 1  hour. Punch down. 3. Roll dough to a 15-inch circle. Transfer to an oiled  14-inch pizza pan, folding the excess over to make a small rim. Spread with  pizza sauce; sprinkle with all but a handful of the mozzarella cheese.  Sprinkle with meats and vegetables. Top with remaining mozzarella and  Parmesan cheese. Let rise in a warm spot about 25 minutes. 4. Heat oven to  475 degrees. Bake pizza until crust is golden, about 25 minutes. Let stand        5    minutes before slicing.
