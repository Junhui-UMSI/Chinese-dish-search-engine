Processor French Bread
Salt, Warm water (105 F), All-purpose or unbleached, Sugar, Active dry yeast, Sugar, Warm water (105 F), 
Makes 2 loaves    Flour    Generously grease baguette pans.    Combine 1/2 cup warm water with yeast and 1 tsp sugar in small bowl and let  stand until yeast is dissolved and mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.    Combine flour, salt, remaining sugar and yeast mixture in work bowl of food  processor.  With machine running, slowly begin adding 1 cup warm water. A  soft ball should form in several seconds; if not, add a little more warm  water.  Let machine run 15 to 20 seconds, adding more flour if dough seems  too soft.    Transfer dough to lightly floured board and knead with a little additional  flour for several turns.  Divide dough in half and shape into two cylinders  8 to 10 inches long. Transfer to prepared pans and cut 3 or 4 diagonal  slashes in top of each loaf with tip of knife or single-edged razor blade.  Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.    After about 30 minutes, place racks in middle and lower quarters of oven  and begin preheating to 450 F. Center shallow pan of water on lower rack.  When dough has doubled, place on middle rack directly above water and bake  10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 400 F and continue baking an additional 15  minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and have a hollow sound when  tapped with finger.    Bon Appetit
