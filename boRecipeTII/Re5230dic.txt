Whiz in blender remaining ingredients except lemon juice with agar and  water mixture. While blending add 1/2 c. oil slowly. Stir in 1/4 c. lemon  juice. Put in mold and chill. For very thick cheese sauce or cheese like  spread, use a little more cashews.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /EGGS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
