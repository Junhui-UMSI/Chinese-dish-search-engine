Yellow Curry Paste (Nam Prik Kaeng Kari)
shallots, Cumin seeds, Ground cloves, lemon grass, Ground cinnamon, Coriander seeds, Dried chilies, Salt, Garlic, Yellow curry powder, 
Place the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan without adding any oil.  Dry-fry them, stirring, over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes until  they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted aroma.    Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes.  Drain.  Pound all the ingredients together to produce a fine paste which goes  well with beef and pork.
