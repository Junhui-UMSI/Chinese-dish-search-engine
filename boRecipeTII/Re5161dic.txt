Pietros Barbecued Salmon
Honey, Dijon mustard, olive oil, Soy sauce, Salmon fillet, Brown Sugar, Margarine, Fresh ginger root; minced,, 
In a small frying pan over medium heat, stir margarine with honey and brown  sugar until margarine melts. Remove from heat; add to pan the soy sauce,  dijon mustard, oil and ginger; mix well. Let sauce cool slightly.    Meanwhile, rinse fish and pat dry. To make fish easier to handle when  cooked, set it skin side down on a large piece of foil; trim foil or fold  under to fit outline of fish. Set fish and foil in a large pan. Stir sauce  and spoon evenly over fish; let stand 15 minutes to 1 hour; frequently  spoon sauce over fish.    Put salmon with foil on a grill over indirect heat. Cover barbecue with  lid, open all vents, and cook until fish is opaque but still moist-looking  in the thickest part (cut to test), 20 to 30 minutes. To move fish onto a  platter, support with two large spatulas or slip a rimless baking sheet  under fish.
