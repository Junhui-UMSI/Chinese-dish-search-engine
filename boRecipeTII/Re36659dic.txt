Strawberry Cream Cake
Sugar, Lemon juice, almonds, Sugar, STRAWBERRY FILLING AND, Whipped cream, Heavy whipping cream, Strawberries, yellow cake, Vanilla extract, 
Bake and cool cake layers.    For the strawberries, reserve 6 perfect berries and leave the hulls intact.  Rinse, hull and slice the remaining berries. Combine them with the sugar  and lemon juice in a bowl and let them macerate for a few hours. When ready  to assemble the cake, drain the berries, reserving the juice.    For the whipped cream, combine all ingredients in the bowl of an electric  mixer and whip cream until it holds a firm peak.    To assemble, place one of the cake layers on a platter or cardboard and  spread with whipped cream. Spread with the drained strawberry filling, then  with another thin layer of whipped cream. Place second layer on and mask  outside of cake with whipped cream. Press the sliced almonds against the  side of the cake.    To decorate, pipe 12 rosettes of the remaining whipped cream at the top  border of the cake. Decorate each rosette with a halved strawberry, cut  side up.
