1993 3rd Place Springerle
Anise oil, Salt, milk, Eggs, Cake flour, Unsalted butter, 
Preparation time: 40 minutes Standing time: 1 hour plus overnight Cooking  time: 10 to 12 minutes Aging time: 1 week or more     1. Mash bakers ammonia with a rolling pin if it is not powdered. Dissolve  it in the milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 hour before using.     2. Beat eggs in large bowl of electric mixer until thick and  lemon-colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in confectioners sugar  until creamy and smooth. Add butter and beat again until creamy. Add anise  oil, dissolved bakers ammonia and salt; beat to mix. Gradually beat in  enough flour to make a stiff dough.     3. Cut off pieces of dough and work in more flour on a floured work  surface until dough is stiff enough to roll out and hold the design of the  springerle rolling pin or mold. Roll out on a lightly floured board with a  floured rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Press design on dough with a  floured springerle rolling pin or mold. Cut cookies apart using a floured  knife. Leave on work surface covered with a clean kitchen towel overnight.     4. The next day, heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake cookies on greased baking  sheets, until barely golden on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes.   Cool on wire racks. Store in tightly covered tins and allow to mellow at  least 1 week before serving.     Note: This recipe also can be made using 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in  place of the milk and the bakers ammonia) and anise extract instead of  anise oil. However, the cookies will not be as delicately textured and the  anise flavor not quite as rich. If using baking powder, add it with the  salt to the batter.     Connie Meisinger of Buffalo Grove tied for third place with this recipe.  from the Chicago Tribune sixth annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest  December 2, 1993  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 04:11:40 +0000
