Cooks notes: To slice onions easily, use the fine slicing blade of the  food processor. The sliced onions are then soaked to soften their flavor.  Cover with cold water and leave overnight or cover with boiling water and  allow to soak for at least 30 minutes, then drain.    Pancetta is a spicy Italian bacon. Its sold in Italian markets. If it  isunavailable, you can substitute regular bacon.    1. In a heavy-bottomed soup pot or Dutch oven, cook sausage, pancetta,  carrot and celery in olive oil on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes,  stirring with a wooden spoon to break up the sausage.    2. Add drained onions to sausage mixture. Stir until liquid on onion  evaporates, 3-4 minutes. Add just enough broth to barely cover the onions,  about 2 cups. Simmer, covered, 1 hour. Add remaining broth and salt to  taste; simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes.    3. Toast bread on both sides under the broiler and rub one side with the  garlic.    Presentation: Place bread in 4 bowls. Ladle soup over bread. Serve.
