In a blender or food processor, grind the jalapenos  and peeled garlic to a pulp.  Add all the other  ingredients, except the meat, and blend well. Cut the  meat into 1-inch cubes and place in a large bowl, and  cover with the marinade.  Marinate overnight or all  day. Place the meat on skewers and cook on the grill  over mesquite wood, basting frequently with the sauce.  Serve with warm flour tortillas and plenty of Mexican  beer with lime slices.
