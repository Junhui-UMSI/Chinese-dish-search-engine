Add rice, garlic paste, salt, Tabasco, and  molasses. Lower heat and simmer, covered, until rice has absorbed almost  all the water, usually 40-45 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, parsley, and  tomato sauce, stir well, and cover.    Fry bacon crisp in skillet; remove and blot on paper towels. Saute green  pepper in bacon drippings; remove using slotted spoon and add to rise  mixture. Crumble bacon and add to rice mixture. Mix well and remove from  heat.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly oil bottom of 1-quart casserole; pour  rice mixture into it and bake for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.  Yield: 3 cups.
