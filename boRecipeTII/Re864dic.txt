Source: A friend, Judy Friedman    Steam squash, turnip, carrot and onion over water in covered pot about 5  minutes. Drain. Combine honey margarine, orange peel and nutmeg. Drizzle  over vegetables and toss.    I forgot to mention to cook the vegetables until just tender, in case 5  minutes is not long enough.
