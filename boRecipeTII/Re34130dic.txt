Batter To Use for Deep Frying Foods
Salt, Vegetable oil, Baking Powder, Sugar, Water, All-purpose flour, Cornstarch, 
Mix all of the ingredients together and blend until there are no lumps.  Preheat the oil in your deep fat fryer to the proper temperature for the    food you are cooking. Dry the fish or the vegetables with a paper towel and  dip into the batter. Place in the hot oil one piece at a time. Try to keep  the pieces from colliding until the batter has had a chance to set (which  it does almost instantly). Cook until the batter has turned a golden brown,  remove to a paper towel to drain and serve at once.    YIELD: enough for about 2 pounds of fish or vegetables    NOTES : This is very good to use for zucchini, broccoli, peppers, green  beans, onion rings and any other firm vegetable. Barbara Hill says this  batter WILL stick to the food. FYI: Pancake mix makes a terriffic batter  for just about anything.  Or use Bisquick or other baking mix prepared  according to package directions for pancakes. Add milk till the consistency  reaches that of syrup. Dredge the item in *dry mix* first, shake of excess,  then dip in batter and let drain for a few seconds; fry at 365? for fish or  chicken nuggets till they float.
