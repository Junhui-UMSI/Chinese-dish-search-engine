Drain the tofu & place the cakes between several layers of paper  towels. Weight the top with a heavy plate & leave for 1 to 3 hours.  While draining, prepare the Satay Sauce & Dipping Sauce.    SATAY SAUCE: Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat.  Cook onion &  garlic until the onion is wilting, approximately 2 minutes.  Add  curry powder & cook for 30 seconds.  Add coconut milk, spy sauce,  sugar, pepper, lemongrass & peanut butter.  Cook over very low heat,  stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.    DIPPING SAUCE: In a small pot, over low heat, dissolve sugar in the  water. Remove from the heat & stir in the vinegar, soy sauce & dried  chili flakes.  When completely cool, add the carrot & peanuts & serve.    When the tofu has drained, slice each cake lengthways into 4 strips.  In a food processor, combine oil, lemongrass, garlic, curry powder,  chili pepper & sugar & process until smooth.  Pour this mixture over  the tofu strips, toss gently to coat the pieces & marinate fro an  hour at room temperature.    Soak 16 wooden skewers in water for 15 minutes.  Carefully insert two  wooden skewers parallel & 1" apart into each tofu slice.  Oil the  grill. On a closed grill over medium-hot coals, grill the tofu,  turning once, until browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Serve with sAtay  Sauce & Dipping Sauce.
