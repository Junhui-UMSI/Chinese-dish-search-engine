In a soup pot, heat oil over high. Add onions, carrots, celery and  mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 10 to 15 minutes.  Add remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and  simmer for 45 minutes. Strain broth through a fine sieve; discard solids.  Makes about 5 cups.    STORAGE: The broth will keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the  freezer for up to 6 months.    TIPs: *Crack a bay leaf and sniff. If fresh and aromatic, use 2 leaves in  the soup. *Coarsely chop the carrots and onion and celery together in a  food processor fitted with metal blade. *No need to peel the garlic. You  may want to peel the onion. Scrub the carrots and wash the leek. *Results:  a generous quart of an amber or apricot colored broth, slightly cloudy.  Chill the broth and the oil separates. Guessing that about 1 tsp of the oil  was absorbed by the onion and maintained. PER BATCH SKIMMED: 500 cals, 8.6  g fat (14.2%).
