Pescado En Mojo De Ajo (Fish in Garlic Sauce)
Skinless fillets, Mild white fish, garlic, lime wedges, Flour, Clarified Butter, Juice of 1 Lime, 
Use only Clarified butter (dont think of using margarine)    Dust the fillets lightly with flour.  Meanwhile, heat some of the  clarified butter in a frying pan until hot but not smoking.  Saute  the fish until lightly browned (some Mexican cooks fry fish until it  is the approximate consistancy of our potato chips <crisps>, but I  feel this is taking authenticity a bit too far :-).    Remove the fish from the pan, and add additional butter if needed  (you will want about 2-3 Tbsp. of melted butter per fillet to sauce  the finished dish).  Add garlic to the pan and saute garlic until it  is a light brown color.  Do not allow it to burn, but do allow the  garlic to take on some color and become slightly crisp.  Squeeze in  the lime juice.    Pour the hot butter/garlic mixture over the fish, and serve.    This dish is quite common in Southern Mexico, and traditionally would  be served with black beans (either whole or refried); perhaps a  simple dish of rice, cooked in chicken broth with chopped cilantro  and a few diced green chiles; a side relish of homemade fresh salsa  (see Pico de Gallo).
