Then cook it in 1/2 cup water for 15-20 minutes and then add the brown rice  and cook together for 45-60 minutes longer. Add extra water if necessary.)  The rices will make 1 cup cooked. Cool or chill. Mix all the ingredients  together and toss with a favorite dressing. This makes a great main dish  for two or a side dish for four.
