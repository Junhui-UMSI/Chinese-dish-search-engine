Potato-Leek Soup
white pepper, Dried dill, potatoes, scallion, Leeks, Garlic powder, Water, Onion powder, 
Place the potatoes, water and leeks in a medium-sized soup pot. Bring to a  boil, reduce the heat, cover and cook until the potatoes are tender, about  30 minutes. Transfer to a blender or food processor and process until  smooth and creamy. Or transfer only half of the soup to a blender or  processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Return to the pan and stir to  mix. This will yield a creamy soup with chunks of vegetables.    Add the remaining ingredients. Heat through. (If you are using the  optional ingredients, cook over very low heat for 10 minutes.) Serve    Inputted by Sue Smith. From _The New McDougall Cookbook_ (Dutton 1993)    Comments: using a hand blender right in the soup pot worked fine.
