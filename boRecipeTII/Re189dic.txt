Sift flour and cornstarch and fold into egg mixture.  Add milk slowly and beat just until smooth.    Spoon mixture into pastry bag fitted with large plain tip.   Pipe mixture into finger-shapes, about 2 inches long.   Sift confectioners sugar over fingers.   Bake until  firm.  Cool completely on baking sheets on wire racks.  Peel off paper when cool.
