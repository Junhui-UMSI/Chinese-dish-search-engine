ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2298    For the venison: In a food processor; pulse the pecans until they are  coarse and still are textured. (Do not puree the pecans because the crust  will be too wet). Add the bread crumbs and Essence. Season each medallion  with salt and pepper. Rub each medallion with the Creole mustard, coating  each side completely.    Crust each medallion with the pecan crust. (*Every inch of the medallion  needs to be crusted completely.) For the mash: the potatoes should be  roasted for 40 minutes at 425 degrees. Remove the skin from the roasted  sweet potatoes and place in a sauce pot.    Over low heat, partially mash the sweet potatoes. Add the cream, bourbon  and butter, continue to mash until all the ingredients are incorporated and  the potatoes are smooth but with small lumps. Season with salt end pepper.  To finish the venison, in a saute pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is  smoking hot, add the venison. Saute for 3 minutes for medium rare on each  side..
