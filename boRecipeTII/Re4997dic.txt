Pickled Pork Snouts (Kilawin)
Soy sauce, fresh Jalapenos, pepper corns, tufu, Onions, Palm Vinegar, Green papaya, Pork snou, garlic, 
Clean hairs from pork snouts by scrapping them with a knife. Remove excess  fat. When snouts are clean put the them in a pot and cover with enough  water to boil.   When you think that the snouts are tender and soft let them cool off and  then cut the snouts into inch size pieces.   Mix the rest of the ingredients in with the cut snouts. Taste a little bit  so you can see if you need to add more of one or two of the ingredients to  suit your taste.
