Apple Crumb Pie
Apples, Sugar, Butter, Brown sugar, Nuts, Cinnamon, Flour, all-purpose, Nutmeg, Pie crust, Butter, 
Core, peel and slice the apples.  Melt the butter and mix the rest in with  it. Pour over apples and mix around so the apples are coated. Put in an  unbaked pie shell.    Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter and nuts. Spread over top of the  filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes, or until it is bubbling.    NOTES:    *  One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then baked,  right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes. The pies will keep a very  long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear.    *  PS:  For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the  convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the mood  grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Margaret Reek  : Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY  : mmr@ritcv.UUCP    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
