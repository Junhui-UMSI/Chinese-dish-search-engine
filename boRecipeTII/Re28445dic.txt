Baked Oatmeal
Baking Powder, Salt, milk, Margarine, Eggs, Oatmeal, Brown sugar, 
Our Hearts Inn Colorado Springs, Colorado    Mix all ingredients together and pour into 13x9 buttered pan. Bake at 375?  for 25 minutes. I like to add dried fruits and nuts and pour into small  ramekins for baking and serving individually. My guests enjoy this very  much and one stated "its like a large baked oatmeal cookie for breakfast".    (I serve the fried apples on top of this.)
