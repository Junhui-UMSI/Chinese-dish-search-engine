First, marinate the skirt steaks in the oil/lime juice mixture as  described above. Overnight in the refrigerator works well using a ziploc  bag.  The amount of marinade depends on the amount of meat. [The lime juice  imparts an incredibly sweet and fresh taste to the meat; you will love the  effect.]     Prepare your accompaniments and have them ready for guests to use  according to their own preferences. Some people fry onions (instead of  using them raw) and others cook some green pepper as accompaniments. I  personally think that this detracts from a simple fresh taste, but hey this  is food, not medicine...     Grill the fajitas outside (over wood charcoal if you can get it)-- over a  medium hot fire this will require about 10 minutes a side.  After grilling,  allow the skirt steaks to sit for a couple of minutes, then slice across  the grain in relatively thin slices.     Warm the flour torillas slightly (microwave will do nicely if you arent a  purist).     Allow people to assemble the fajitas themselves:  slices of meat rolled in  the torillas together with accompaniments of their choice.  You may also  want to have some hot pepper sauce and cilantro also at the ready.     This is a "cant lose" company dish; the meat when re-heated tastes good  as left-overs as well.     NOTE:  Beef skirt steaks (you may have to ask the butcher for these  outside the Southwest; they are inexpensive and readily available in the  prime fajita areas of the country such as Texas) [Note that you can use  flank steak if forced to but it just doesnt taste the same.] Michael  Karchmer MAKARCHMER@gallua.gallaudet.EDU    AT986@FREENET.CARLETON.CA    (WARD TOMLINSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
