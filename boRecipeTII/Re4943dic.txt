Pickled Hot Red Peppers
Olive oil, or as needed, Small, fresh hot red peppers, Distilled white vinegar, Bay leaf; torn into quarters, Peppercorns, Whole allspice, Water, Garlic, Salt, 
RINSE AND DRAIN THE PEPPERS; trim stems to a stub. Pack the peppers into 4  wide-mouthed pint canning jars, dividing them equally. As the peppers are  packed, scatter among them a share of the seasonings:    In each jar place: 1 clove garlic split; 2 whole allspice; 6 peppercorns;  and a piece of bay leaf.    Combine the vinegar, water and salt in a stainless-steel or enameled  saucepan and heat the mixture to simmering. Pour the hot solution over the  peppers, covering them completely and leaving 1 inch of head space. Remove  any bubbles and add liquid if necessary to maintain head space. (If there  should be insufficient solution to cover the peppers, make more in the same  proportions; no harm will be done if a few moments are required to do  this.) Add enough olive oil to each jar to cover the surface of the liquid,  about 1 tablespoon. Seal the jars with new two-piece canning lids,  according to manufacturers directions and process for 15 minutes in a  boiling water bath. Cool, label and store the jars. The peppers are good to  eat after 2 weeks, but they will be better after at least a months rest in  the jar. Makes 4 Jars
