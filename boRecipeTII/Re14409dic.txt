Whole Wheat Crackers #1
Whole wheat flour, Dry mustard, Ice water, -(up to), Cayenne pepper, Butter, Unbleached white flour, 
Adapted from The Pantry Gourmet.    Combine the flours, cayenne and mustard in mixing bowl.  Cut in the butter  until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  With a fork stir in ice water  until the mixture barely holds together.  Do not add too much water or the  crackers will be tough.    Place the dough in a plastic bag, and knead a few times until the dough  holds together.  Chill for half and hour or overnight (set out about an  hour before rolling if chilled overnight).    Preheat the over to 350 degrees.  Divide the dough into quarters, and roll  it out, a section at a time, on a lightly floured surface.  Try to roll the  dough as thin as possible.  Cut into 1 1/2 inch squares (a small straight  edge pizza cutter works well). Set aside any scraps to reroll later. Place  the squares on a baking sheet (prick with fork to avoid bubbling).    Bake for about 10 minutes, or until they are lightly browned.  Watch them  clocely because the crackers burn quickly.  Cool on racks.  Store in  covered tins, where the crackers will stay fresh for a week. Makes about  100+ (more with practice) crackers    Variation:  Sesame Seed Crackers.  Add 3/4 cup roasted sesame seeds to the  dough.  Lightly brush crackers with sesame oil before baking.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
