Pound cilantro roots, garlic and chilies in a mortar or blender coarsely.  Add sugar, lime juice, salt and blend well, set aside. Bring a pot of water  to a boil over high heat. Put squids in a strainer, lower the strainer into  the water and boil briefly just until the squids are cooked (DO NOT  overcook). Lift the strainer up and drain well.
