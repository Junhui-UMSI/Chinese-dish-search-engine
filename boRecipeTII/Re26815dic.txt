Baked Artichoke Party Dip
fresh garlic, Sour cream, Butter, Cream cheese, artichoke hearts , dark rye bread, Green Onions, Cheddar cheese, 
I was just mixing this up for a party Im having on Sunday and thought you  all would enjoy the recipe. This is soooooo good and simple. I always hope  to have leftovers and I end up eating it for lunch (or even dinner) the  next day. It comes from the Mr. Food Cookbook - OH, Its So Good -    Cut a hole in the top of the bread loaf about 5 inches in diameter. Remove  soft bread from cut portion and discard. Reserve crust to make top for  loaf. Scoop out most of the soft inside portion of the loaf and save for  other purposes, such as stuffing or dried bread crumbs. In the butter,  saute the green onions and the garlic until the onions wilt. Cut the cream  cheese into small chunks, add the onions, garlic, sour cream and cheddar  cheese. Mix well. Fold in artrichoke hearts, Out all of this mixture into  hollowed out bread. Place top on bread and wrap in a couble thickness of  heavy duty aluminum foil. Bake in 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. When  ready, remove foil and serve, using cocktail rye bread to dip out the  sauce.  Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by J Pellegrino <gigimfg@ix.netcom.com> on Jun  05, 1998
