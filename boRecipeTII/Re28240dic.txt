I have a number of old cookbooks with one going back to its first  publishing in 1908. Here is a recipe from "The Gentlemans Companion, Vol  1, Exotic Cookery Book" 1946 edition, first published in 1939, by Charles  H. Baker, Jr. Most of the recipes are in narrative with anecdotes about how  the author found the recipes around the world.    One secret is that fish is painted inside and out with lime juice, salted  lightly, and iced that way for at least 4 hours before cooking. Take well  greased baking dish; dispose fish on bottom. Mix chopped nuts with cheese,  garlic pulp and onion, moistening with milk to make stiff paste. Salt and  cayenne to taste, and all seasonings. Then spread your fish with this  toothsome blanket, and cover with dry fine bread crumbs. On this put  generous walnuts of butter and brown in medium oven around 350 to 375  Fahrenheit, basting well. Chopped almonds, Brazils, hazelnuts or pecans do  equally well, but the cashew is traditional in the Philippines.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by CathCooks <CathCooks@aol.com> on Jan 18,  1998
