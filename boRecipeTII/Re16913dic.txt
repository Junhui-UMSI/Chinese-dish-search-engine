Cucumber sliced, Onion sliced, Clove garlic minced, Salt, Tomato sliced, Coarsely ground black, Lettuce, Balsamic vinegar, Pepper, 
Combine all ingredients except lettuce in the order listed. Cover container  and shake for 30 seconds. Leave in refrigerator for at least 10 mins so  that flavors get absorbed in vegetables. Then toast bread of choice.  Arrange lettuce on bread and add cucumber and tomato mixture. * French  bread works best.
