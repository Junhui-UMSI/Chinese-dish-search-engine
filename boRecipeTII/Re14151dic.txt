To make a white fricassee of chicken, remove skin, cut them up into  pieces of desired size.  Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace, and  strew over the pieces some shredded marjoram. Put them into a stewpot, and  pour over them the cream, or whole milk. Add some butter rolled in flour,  and if you choose, some small forcemeat balls. Set the stew pan over a low  flame.  Keep it tightly covered, and stew or simmer it gently till the  chicken is quite tender, but do not allow to boil. Serve hot.    Source:  The First Ladies Cookbook - 1969 .
