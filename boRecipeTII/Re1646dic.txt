Heat oil in  pressure cooker.  Add garlic, onions and chili pepper; cook  over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, 1 minute. Add bell pepper,  tomatoes, water, rice, coconut, thyme and salt. Lock lid in place. If using  a jiggle-top cooker, set on a flame tamer. Over high heat, bring to high  pressure. Lower heat just enough to maintain high pressure; cook 25  minutes. Allow pressure to come down naturally 10 minutes (if after 10  minutes pressure is not released, use a quick-release method to release  lid). Remove lid. Add cooked peas and cilantro. Stir well to distribute  coconut. Serve topped with plantains. Serves 6.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "jack lewis" <jlewis@bigsky.net> on Aug 14,  98
