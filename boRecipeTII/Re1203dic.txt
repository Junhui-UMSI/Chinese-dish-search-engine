Crispy-Skinned Salmon
Kosher salt; or less, Garlic; chopped, Dried thyme, Dried Rosemary, Crumbled bay leaves, Salmon fillets; with skin, olive oil, Cracked black pepper, 
1. Brush salmon with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Combine pepper, salt, garlic,  thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf. Sprinkle on salmon. Leave to marinate for 2  hours on counter or 4 hours refrigerated.    2. Heat remaining oil on medium-high heat in a non-stick skillet. Add  salmon, skin-side down. Fry 1 minute then cover pan and cook for 6 to 8  minutes or until salmon is cooked but still slightly pink in centre. Remove  salmon fillet from skin and place on dish. Remove skin, sliver and sprinkle  over salmon.    Serving Ideas : Lucy Waverman: frites or mashed potatoes    NOTES : The recipe is for 4 6-ounce salmon fillets with skin on, but it  worked well on a single large fillet of the same total weight. I find that  1 1/2 teaspoons salt make the salmon sufficiently salty. The marinated  salmon can also be cooked on a preheated barbeque, with the lid down.
