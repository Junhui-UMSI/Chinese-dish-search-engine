Combine meat,  onion, salt, and pepper. Drain cabbage leaves. Place a portion of meat in  each cabbage leaf; roll up and fasten with a toothpick. Place cabbage rolls  in a large deep kettle. Add all the remaining ingredients except the  gingersnaps. If there is not enough liquid to cover rolls, add water just  to cover . Bring to a boil and cook at a slow boil for 1 hour. Put a layer  of gingersnaps over the tops of the cabbage rolls. Reduce heat and simmer 1  hour longer. Serves 6 - 8    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #311 by "Jeffrey A.
