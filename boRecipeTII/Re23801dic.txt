Asiago Bagels
Flour; approximately, Active dry yeast, Egg yolk, Sugar, Salt, Asiago Cheese; or parmesan, 
Combine yeast and 2 cups warm (110@) water in a large bowl; let stand 5  mins. Stir in sugar, salt and 5 1/2 cups flour til moistened.    Spread 1/2 cup flour on a board and scrape dough onto it. Knead dough til  very smooth and elastic, 10 to 15 mins; add more flour as required to  prevent sticking. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic  wrap and let rise in a warm place til almost doubled, about 40 mins.    When dough is almost risen, bring 3 quarts water to boiling in a covered 4  to 5 qt pan over high heat. Meanwhile knead dough on a lightly floured  board to expel air then divide into 12 equal pieces. To shape bagel, knead  each piece into a smooth ball. Holding the ball with both hand, poke you  thumbs thru the center to form a hole. With 1 thumb in the hole, work  around the bagel to make it smooth and evenly thick.    Set bagels on lightly floured 12 x 15" baking sheets; let stand covered  with plastic wrap just til they are slightly puffy, about 10 mins. With  your hand, gently slip bagels into boiling water, adding 4 at a time to  pan. Adjust heat to maintain a gentle boil and turn bagels often til they  feel firm but are still slightly spongy, 3 to 5 mins. Chill remaining  bagels til ready to use. With a slotted spoon transfer bagels to a towel;  drain briefly, then place bagels slightly apart on 2 lightly oiled 12 x 15"  baking sheets.    In a food processor or with a knife, coarsely chop cheese. Beat egg yolk to  blend with 1 tbsp water and brush mixture over bagels. Then pat cheese onto  bagels, pressing gently to make cheese stick. Bake bagels in a 375@ oven  til browned, 30 to 35 mins. Cool on racks. Serve warm or cool.
