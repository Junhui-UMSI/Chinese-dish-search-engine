Sprinkle with 1 pkg  Strawberry Jello (dry powder) as evenly as possible.  Sprinkle 1/2 to 1 cup  sugar over that.  Next layer is 1 pkg yellow cake mix (straight out of the  box).  Last pour 1/2 to 1 cup water over everything. This should be done as  evenly as possible, dampening as much of the cake mix power as you can.  Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Good warm,  good cold, good plain and yummy with Cool Whip on top.
