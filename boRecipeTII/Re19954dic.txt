Apple Butter
Allspice, Nutmeg, Cloves, Unsweetened Applesauce, Cinnamon, Brown sugar, SPICES, Granulated sugar, Apple Cider, 
The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier texture  thats best for applesauce. Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and  cook in a slow oven (325 deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally. Add  spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple butter requires long,  slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)  Posted to EAT-L Digest 17 Sep 96    Date:    Wed, 18 Sep 1996 06:56:27 -0500    From:    LD Goss <ldgoss@METRONET.COM>
