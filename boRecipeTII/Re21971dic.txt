This is a flavorful and moist chocolate cake.    Mix eggs, vanilla, oil, and applesauce together until well blended. Combine  the dry ingredients and add to the egg mixture.  Beat for another 2  minutes. Stir in the carrots. Pour into greased 13x9 pan. Bake at 350 for  50 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.
