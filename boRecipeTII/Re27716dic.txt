Notes: Machine Shed restaurant, Interstate 94 and Waukesha County Highway  J, Pewaukee, WI.    Boil potatoes in water to cover 1 minute. Drain; set aside.    In large, heavy pot, saute bacon, onions and celery over medium-high heat  until celery is tender. Drain grease and return bacon, onions and celery to  pot.    Add milk, water, chicken base, salt and pepper. Heat over medium-high heat  until very hot but do not let soup boil.    In heavy, large saucepan over low heat, melt margarine. Stir in flour to  make a roux. Mix well and let bubble, stirring 1 minute. If desired, a  larger amount of roux can be made to produce a thicker soup.    Gradually add roux to soup, stirring constantly. Continue to cook,  stirring, until thick and creamy.    Stir in potatoes, parsley and cream. Serve hot, garnished with cheese,  bacon bits and/or onions. Makes 6 to 8 servings.    Gretchen A.
