Apple Burritos with Cider Butter Sauce
APPLE FILLING, Granny Smith apples-or any, Fresh ground nutmeg, CIDER BUTTER SAUCE, Butter, Granulated white sugar, Lemon, Leek, Cinnamon stick; (1/2-inch, Leek, Flour tortillas; (8-inch), Butter, Whipping cream; optional, Butter, Apple cider, 
PREPARATION: For the filling, peel and core apples and cut into 1-inch  pieces. Squeeze juice from lemon. Melt the butter in a large, nonreactive  flying pan. Add the apples, lemon juice, sugar, and nutmeg to taste and  cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft but not  mushy, about 15 minutes.    For the Cider Butter Sauce, cut both leeks for the sauce and for the  garnish into thin julienne strips, reserving 1/2 for garnish. Break  cinnamon stick into pieces. Put the cider, 1/2 of leeks, and cinnamon stick  in a pot, bring to a boil, and reduce by 2/3, about 20 minutes. Remove  cinnamon stick.    Recipe can be made to this point a day ahead.    Heat oven to 3500F. Wrap tortillas in foil and warm in preheated oven,  about 10 minutes. Reheat apple filling and sauce.    Melt the 2 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan and saute the remaining  leek over medium heat, stirring until soft, about 3 minutes. Over the  lowest possible heat, add the 1 pound of cold butter to the sauce, about a  tablespoon at a time, adding another piece as each is almost incorporated.  Butter should not melt completely but should soften to form a creamy sauce.  If the sauce gets too hot and butter starts to melt, remove it from the  heat and continue adding butter.    Put an equal amount of apple filling on each tortilla and roll it up. Put a  burrito on each plate. Top with Cider Butter Sauce and sprinkle with  sauteed leek. Top with a dollop of whipped cream if you like.    Recipe by Mangia!
