Posted by Gaye Levy DTXT63A, LOAF-----, Yeast, Water, Bread flour, Salt (I used 3/4 tsp), Cornmeal, 
***   Slightly adapted for my use from Bread Machine Magic *** Place all  ingredients except cornmeal in breadpan. Select dough setting and start. At  beep, turn dough onto a floured countertop or cutting board. (I spray an  acrylic board with Pam and skip the flour). Shape the dough into 12" oblong  loaf, 1 large round loaf, 2 18-inch baguettes, or 8 french rolls.    Dust the top with a little flour; rub it in.  Place on a cookie sheet  dusted with cornmeal.  Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm over  30 to 45 minutes of until doubled. To warm oven slightly, turn on warm  setting for two minutes then turn it of    Place a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven. Preheat oven to  450~. Immediately before placing bread in oven, slash tops with a very  sharp knife (I use a serratted knife) about 1/2" deep.    Bake round or oblong loaves 20 minues, baguettes about 15 minutes, french  rolls bake 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack.    This is best served within hours of baking.  To preserve crisp crust, do  not store in plastic wrap or bags.    Posted to EAT-L Digest - 18 Jun    Date:    Wed, 19 Jun 1996 01:10:40 -0400    From:    Kappie King <Lestat6663@AOL.COM>
