Put all ingredients in large bowl, gradually adding flour, mixing until  ready to knead.  Knead 10 minutes and shape into a ball.  Put into a  greased bowl, let rise until doubled. Punch down and let rise again.    Then divide into 3 balls, roll out into long strands and braid.  Put onto  greased pans, brush with beaten egg, sprinkle with sugar.  Let rise again.    Bake at 325 degree oven approximately 1/2 hour.  Check for doneness. Be  careful, because even though the top may be dark the inside may not be  done.  If the bottom is brown, then the bread should be done.    >From: Mary Lou Jordan <NMJORDAN@nmtech.nmtc.mtcs.tec.me.us>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
