With Christmas soon upon us I thought it would be nice to post some of my  favorite cheesecakes all taken from my Simply Delicious cooking 2 cookbook.    Have fun, Chef K    Cream the butter, sugar and vanilla, add the flour and mix well. Press into  the bottom of a 10" spring form pan. Spread the crust with jam.    FILLING: Beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add the  eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour evenly over jam.    TOPPING: Combine sugar and cinnamon, toss with sliced apples and spoon over  cream cheese layer. Sprinkle with almonds and bake in a preheated oven at  350 F (180 C) 75 minutes or until golden.
