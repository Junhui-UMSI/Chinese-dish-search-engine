Penuche Fudge
Light Cream, milk, Butter, Pecans, Vanilla extract, Brown Sugar, Granulated sugar, 
Combine sugars, milk, and cream in a 2-quart sauce pan and bring to medium  heat until sugars dissolved. Bring to a rolling boil stirring constantly  until candy thermometer reaches 236F (soft-ball drop stage) or for about 8  minutes. Remove from heat and add butter stirring until melted. Let set  unstirred until the temperature is 110F (uncomfortable to touch but wont  burn you) then add vanilla and stir vigorously (5-10 minutes) until mixture  cools enough to lose its glossy texture. Fold in nuts and pour.  Remarks:    A simple fudge with a unique taste from the molasses in the brown sugar.  Penuche is a standard around Easter. Also a regional favorite - popular in  Southern States and in Mexico.    If you dont have brown sugar you may substitute 1 cup of white sugar + 1/4  cup molasses.    WARNING: Dont substitute 2 1/2 cups of light brown sugar for the mixture  of brown and granulated sugar. This would result in too much molasses which  interfers with the sugar slurry reaching its soft ball stage... therefore  what would appear to set by the standard techniques (boiling temperature,  drop-test, etc.) wont set... fluid fudge... fudge failure!
