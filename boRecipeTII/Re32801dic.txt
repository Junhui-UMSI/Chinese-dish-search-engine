Peel and rinse potato. Place in cold water until ready to grate to keep  from discoloring.     Grate sweet potato to equal 2 cups. Then transfer to large bowl. Add  eggs, salt and sugar. Mix thoroughly. Fold in raisins and almonds.     In large, heavy skillet, heat 1/4 inch of oil over medium heat. Drop  potato mixture by tablespoons into hot oil, flattening each spoonful with  back of spoon to form thin latke. Fry on both sides until golden brown and  crisp, about 3 minutes on each side.     Watch carefully because latkes brown quickly. Drain on paper towels.  Serve hot with sour cream and powdered sugar. Makes about 12 latkes.

Times article, "Eight Days of Latkes",  11/25/94, page H7.     "These latkes are family favorites. Frying the mixture on medium-low  heat gives the sweet potatoes a chance to become almost caramelized. Finish  frying on medium-high heat. They freeze well and can be crisped in the oven  before serving."    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #321 by ELAINE  RADIS  (AUNTIE_E@prodigy.net) on Dec 8, 1997
