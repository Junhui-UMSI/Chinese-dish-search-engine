It took me years to develop a good corn bread recipe. So many  recipes are dry, crumbly, and uninspiring. This version hits the spot. The  alliance of beans and corn once again yields a satisfying result. Although  this corn bread makes a scrumptious breakfast, it is also a tasty companion  to soup, chili, or stew.
