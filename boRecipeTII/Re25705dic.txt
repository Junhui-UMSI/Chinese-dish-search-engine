B-Nut Butter
Peanut butter, Great Northern Beans,, 
Im not sure if this is the right list (Im behind on my digests)...but my  Weight Watchers leader gave us a good version:    Mix well and serve on bread.  Good consistency, and you dont have to but  it.  ITS EASY!    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n200    Date: Sun, 27 Oct 1996 10:53:59 PDT    From: "Larry Mayer" <LMAYER@kusc.usc.edu>
