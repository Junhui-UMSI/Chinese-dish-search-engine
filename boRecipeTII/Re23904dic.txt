COVER THE BLACK BEANS with warm water for 5 minutes. Drain. Rinse  thoroughly to remove salt. Put into a bowl with the garlic and ginger; mash  into a paste and set aside. Slice the beef against the grain into 1/4-inch  thick slices; toss with the beef marinade. Set aside for 10 minutes.  Preheat a wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Over high heat, add  beef and stir-fry for a minute or until seared; remove and set aside. While  wok is hot, add remaining oil, salt and reserved black-bean paste; stir-fry  until fragrant, a few seconds. Toss in the onions, stir-fry for 10 seconds,  then add the asparagus in 2-or-3 batches, seconds apart, making certain the  wok is hot before adding the next batch. Toss and stir until asparagus are  coated with the oil. Sprinkle with soy sauce, toss together, then pour in  the stock and bring to a boil. If the asparagus needs more cooking, cover  for a minute. Meanwhile, stir the cornstarch, water, sugar and oyster sauce  into a smooth paste. When the asparagus is tender but still crisp, add the  cornstarch liquid into the center of the wok. Immediately stir until  thickened, about 10 seconds. Return the beef, add a desh of sesame oil;  toss to mix. Serve hot over rice.    JOYCE JUE - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
