Low fat plain yogurt, Granola, Honey, Fresh strawberries, Tall parfait glass, 
The name of the game is to layer each of the ingredients evenly in the  glass. Start by placing a tablespoon of granola at the bottom of each  glass. Next, add a tablespoon of yogurt. Use the back of a spoon to smooth  it around. Then place a thin layer of strawberries over the yogurt.    Repeat the process until layers reach the top of the glass. Top with a  dollop of yogurt, honey to taste, and a whole strawberry.
