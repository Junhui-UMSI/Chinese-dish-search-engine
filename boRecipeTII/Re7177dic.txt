Pork and Black Bean Chili Verde Pt 2
See part 1, 
me these are the same as "Biscayne" peppers and closely related to  cubanelles. The cubanelle is shaped roughly like an Anaheim, a long, skinny  pepper. Its color ranges from yellow-green to orange. Biscayne peppers tend  more toward red than orange and are stubbier. Several chile-heads informed  me that cubanelles are available in Italian markets (Andronico?s in the San  Francisco area was specifically mentioned), and that seed catalogs often  carry the seeds.    4. If you have the time, roasting the chiles over a charcoal or other  wood-based fire adds a nice smoky flavor. You might also want to spray the  chiles with spray-on olive oil before roasting, as it makes the skin come  off easier.    5. I cant imagine a blender handling this volume of the chile-spinach  mixture. I used a large Cuisinart and had to add more spinach several times  to fit an entire pound into the bowl.    6. Be sure to throw away the fat from the ham hock.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #191 by TonyLima@ms.spacebbs.com (Tony  Lima) on Nov 10, 1997
