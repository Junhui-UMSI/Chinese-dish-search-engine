Whole Grain Griddle Cakes
Baking soda, Buttermilk or yogurt, Melted butter or bacon, Finely milled whole wheat, Sugar; honey or molasses, Salt, Double-acting baking powder, Egg, All purpose flour; sifted, 
Sift the flour with salt, baking powder and baking soda. Stir in whole  wheat flour. In a seperate bowl, combine and beat sugar, egg, buttermilk  and butter.    Mix the liquid ingredients together quickly into the dry ingredients. Dont  overbeat. Give just enough quick strokes to barely moisten the dry  ingredients. Ignore the lumps. Pour the batter from the tip of the spoon  onto a hot griddle. It will be two to three minutes before the cakes are  ready to turn. When bubbles appear on the upper surfaces, but before they  break, lift the cakes with a spatula to see how well they have browned.  Turn the cakes only once and continue cooking them until the second side is  done. Cooking this side takes only about half as long, and the second side  never browns as evenly. Serve the cakes at once.
