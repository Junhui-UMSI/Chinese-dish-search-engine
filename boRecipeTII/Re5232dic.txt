Pimento Cheese Sandwiches
Mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese (sharp,, Jar (16 oz) of pimentoes (?, 
Grate the cheddar cheese, I prefer coarsely grated, not the pureed stuff  you buy at the grocery store, but its up to you. Add pimentoes and juice  to cheese and mix well. I think I usually make a 2:1 cheese:pimento  mixture, so you might want to have a couple of jars of pimentoes on hand  and just add until you like the way it looks. Add mayonnaise, a dollop at a  time, mixing after each addition, until the mixture reaches a spreadable  consistency. Spread on sandwiches. After sitting in the fridge a while,  this spread will "soak" up the mayonnaise and you may need to add more.
