This is very easy to make, and delish!    Chop the cucumbers into very small cubes and remove seeds.  Beat the yogurt  and add garlic, cucumber, s&p.  Stir and dilute with cold water to the  consistency of a cream soup.  Chill and serve sprinkled with the fresh  dill.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #105    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
