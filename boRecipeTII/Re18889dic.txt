Angel Cake
Sugar, Salt, Vanilla, Eggs -- seperated, Cream of tartar, Pastry flour, Cold water, 
Separate the eggs.  Beat the yolks well, add the cold water and beat again.  Add the sugar gradually, a tablespoonful at a time, while beating and beat  until the sugar is disolved.  This requires a lot of beating. Fold in the  sifted flour.  Add salt to egg white, whip to a froth, add cream of tartar,  whip until stiff and dry, fold in lightly.  Fold in the vanilla. Bake in a  slow, 325(deg), oven for one hour, or until the top springs back when  touched.  Remove from oven, invert pan until cake is cold. Ice with your  favorite frosting.
