Pesto Alla Genovese
Pecorino Romano (this means, Cloves of garlic (up to 2), Pine nuts, Basil leaves, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 
the Ingredients are very simple because pesto is a poor dish.    the tradition suggest to use a pestle but nowdays can be used an osteriser.    the tipical pasta used for the pesto alla genovese is "Trenette" or  "Linguine" that is a kind of flat spaghetti. One last raccomandation, once  that the "Trenette" and the Pesto are well mixed in the pan serve the pasta  on a dish where there you layed few boilled potatoes cutted in thin disks,  this will make it really "Genovese"!
