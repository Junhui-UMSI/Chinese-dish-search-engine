Tom Moores Irish Stew Casserole
Salt, pepper to taste, [generous] rosemary, Chicken or lamb stock, Lean lamb, the shoulder, Potatoes, peeled and, Onion, thinly sliced, 
Layer one third of the potatoes in a small casserole.  Top with half  the lamb and half the onion.  Sprinkle lightly with rosemary, salt  and pepper. Repeat layers, ending with a final layer of potato.  Add  enough chicken stock to almost cover the stew.    Cover the casserole and bake in a 325 oven until the lamb is quite  tender and the potatoes begin to almost dissolve and thicken the  mixture. (1- 1 1/2 hours)    Ive made this in larger quantities in a crock pot.  In this case, the  cooking time will be about 8-10 hours.    I got these directions for making Irish Stew (no real recipe) from the  owner of Tom Moores Tavern in Bermuda (dont know how authentic it  is, as the gentleman was German, but it IS good) .
