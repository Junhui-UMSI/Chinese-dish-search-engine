Vietnamese - Lemongrass Chicken
Red chile peppers, GARNISH, Sugar, Black pepper, Coriander leaves, Frying chicken, Salt, Scallion, Nuoc Mam, Lemongrass, Peanut oil, Dry-roasted peanuts, 
Hack the chicken into small serving pieces, chopping through the bones  with a very sharp cleaver.     Remove the outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely slice the tender  white part at the base of the stalks. Bruise with a mortar and pestle or  the handle of a cleaver.     Finely slice the scallions, including the green tops.     Mix the chicken with the salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the lemongrass and  scallions and set aside for 30 minutes.     Heat a wok and add the oil, and when the oil is hot add the chicken  mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes.     Add chile peppers and stir-fry on medium heat for 10 minutes or until  chicken no longer looks pink.     Season with sugar and pepper and add the chicken stock. Stir for a few  minutes.     Garnish with the peanuts, "nuoc mam" and coriander.   Serve with rice, if desired.     This quickly prepared but terrifically flavorful dish is great served  with rice paper wrappers.  I love it with a few leaves of mint and basil.  This is one you must try. It is easily done in a wok.
