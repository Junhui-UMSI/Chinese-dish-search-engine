Unless the instructions that came with your ABM  call for putting the  yeast in the pan first and incorporating the liquid ingredients last, pour  the milk into the baking pan of your ABM and break in the egg. If the  butter is not soft, cut it into small chunks to ensure its blending into  the dough, then add it to the liquids.     Next add the almond paste, slicced so it will blend better too. Measure in  the flour, brown sugar, and salt, and add the yeast as directed for your  bread maker.     You can use your machines full cycle with this bread, but the quick cycle  is better. If a light color setting is available, use it as well.     As soon as the bread has finished baking, remove it from the machine,  closing the cover again, and ease the loaf from the pan. Combine the corn  syrup and warm water and brush the top of the loaf with this mixture, using  a pastry brush. Sprinkle the slivered almonds over the glaze, put the bread  gently back in its pan, and return it to the electronic oven for a few  minutes to dry the glaze a bit.
