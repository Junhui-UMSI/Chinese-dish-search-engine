White Onion Soup
Flour, Chicken stock, Salt and pepper, cheese, milk, Butter, Cream, Onions, Bay leaf, Cloves, Powdered mace, 
Heat the butter, and when foaming add the onions and cloves. Let the  onions soften, but not color at all.  Sprinkle over the flour, mix well  and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute;  then add the nutmeg, the bay leaf  and the stock.  Stir all the time until it boils, and see that it is  smooth.  Simmer until the onions are cooked, then gradually add the milk,  stirring, and when that boils lift out the cloves and bay leaf.    .  It can now be liquidized, or served as is with the cream added, and a  sprinkling of grated cheese.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/irish.zip
