Larrys Dark Zucchini Bread
Baking soda, Eggs, Vegetable oil, Brown sugar, Vanilla, Grated zucchini, Molasses, Flour, Baking Powder, Cinnamon, Allspice, Nutmeg, Pecans, Salt, 
Beat eggs, oil, & brown sugar together. Add vanilla, zucchini, & molasses.  Mix dry ingredients together. Add to the zucchini "wet" mixture. Add nuts.  Mix well. Bake in floured loaf pan at 350F for approximately 1 hr.    Larry bakes bread when we grow zucchini. This is my favorite version. His  is the Light bread version. I have used both recipes for years. Dont  remember the original inspiration, this has been tweaked with a lot over  time.
