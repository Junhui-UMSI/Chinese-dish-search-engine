Argentine Marinade
Spanish onion, diced, Virgin olive oil (1 20ml), Lemon juice, Thyme, salt and pepper, White wine vinegar (1 20 ml), Saffron threads, Garlic cloves, pressed, Parsley, chopped, 
An Argentine asado or barbecue is not authentic without this delicious  marinade called chimichuri. it is similar to a multi spiced  vinaigrette and is given an earthier tone with the addition of  saffron.    I serve this with poultry or shellfish and brush it on top of garlic  bread before toasting.    Powder threads and steep in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Combine all  ingredients with whisk and store in covered jar.    From "Wild About Saffron++A Contemporary Guide to an Ancient Spice",  by Ellen Szita.
