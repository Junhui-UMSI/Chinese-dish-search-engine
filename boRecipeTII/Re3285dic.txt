[1] Combine pear, water, and juice in pan.  Bring to boil. Remove from  heat; let stand and cool.     [2] Remove pear and any seeds that surfaced. Reserve 1 1/4 cup of liquid  in a 2-cup measuring cup.     [3] Heat a little optional olive oil in the skillet and add meat, cook  until browned and tender. Remove from pan and keep warm.     [4] Add garlic and mustard to the skillet and cook about 1 minute.  Dissolve cornstarch in the pear water;  add to skillet and stir over heat  until mixture boils and thickens.  Stir in brandy (or cap of brandy extract  for the flavor).  Add extra garlic. Quickly slice the steak; slice the  pear. Two portions: Arrange a fan of pear on heated plate and a fan of beef  slices.  Put orange shred between the fans.  Cover with the sauce. Garnish  with parsley or mint.    (Notes --leave the peel on the pear.   * tenderloins been tough (96).  Trim a strip; a sirloin. If we grill (charcoal) the meat, put a little of  the juice caught on the meat platter in the skillet and warm the garlic  and mustard in that. Make 1 steak, 3/4-lb. Extra beef added to a lentil and  spinach soup - good, do again.)  NOTES : Fast! Steep pear about an hour ahead of time.  Make-ahead side       dish,       like confetti rice, works well.  Warm dinner plates on top of       steamer.
