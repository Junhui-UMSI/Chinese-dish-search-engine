"douglas allen thompson" <aesculus@TSO.UC.EDU>    Mix cubed chicken with coconut milk, chili paste, peppers and cilantro.  Allow to sit for at least an hour to absorb flavours.    Then, taking a cube of chicken (or two, depending on size), center it in a  wonton skin,gather the four corners of the skin with your fingers moistened  in the cornstarch paste, and twirl the skin until the dumpling looks like a  Hersheys Kiss.    Allow these to rest on waxed paper or a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM. Deep  fry these in sufficient oil to cover, a few at a time.  I use peanut oil  but anything that can take a high heat is fine. Olive oil smokes too much.    Remove from hot oil when they float and are golden brown. Be careful, they  cook very fast.    I usually provide a peanut sauce to dip these in but theyre fine by  themselves    I do not use exact measurements when I cook, so the above are only  approximations of what I use. If it looks right, it probably will be fine.    These work out great for parties, too.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
