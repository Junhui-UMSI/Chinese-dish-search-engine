Peel, and, if you wish, devein the shrimp.  Save the shells for stock.  Refrigerate the shrimp until you are ready to use them.    Warm the oil in a heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the  onions, garlic, green pepper, and green chile, and saute them, stirring  occasionally, until the onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the  dried seasonings and the rice, stirring to coat all the grains, and cook  another couple of minutes. Add the stock and the lemon juice, and bring the  liquid to a boil.  Cover the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, and  simmer 18 minutes. Check the mixture toward the end of the cooking time,  and stir if the rice appears to be sticking.  Add the shrimp and the sliced  green onions, stirring to incorporate them. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more.    Remove the skillet from the heat, and let the shrimp and rice sit, covered,  for 10 minutes.  Then sprinkle the cilantro over the dish, and serve it  immediately. Eat any leftovers the next day. Source: Texas Home Cooking by  Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison.    Shared and MM by Judi M.
