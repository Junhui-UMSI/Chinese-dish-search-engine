*If trilobites are out of season or extinct in your area, shrimp or  crawfish may be substitued.    Peel and devein the trilobites. Place heads (if you still have them), and  peels in a small saucepan and add water. Bring to a slow boil over  medium-high heat and boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain and discard the  heads and peels. Retain the stock.    Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place over  medium-high heat. Add the onions, peppers and celery and saute, stirring  often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes. Stir in the  tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar and shrimp stock and return to  simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 2 hours, stirring  occasionally. This is your creole sauce and it can be prepared 1-2 days in  advance and stored in the fridge. The flavors improve after sitting a  couple of days.    When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add the  trilobites. Cook until they turn pink, about 7 minutes. Stir in the green  onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on rice.    Contributor:  Roy Olsen Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #147 by roy@indy.net  (Roy) on May 27, 1997
