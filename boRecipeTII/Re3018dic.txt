Beat margarine until creamy. Add the 2  sugars, and beat until blended. Add the eggs, and beat until smooth and  light; then add the peanut butter, and mix well. Combine the flour, baking  soda and salt. Add to the peanut butter mixture, and beat well. Roll dough  into small balls, and place on ungreased cookie sheets. Press each cookie  with the back of a fork (in a criss-cross design) dipped in flour, if it  sticks to dough Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until edges are SLIGHTLY brown.  Remove from sheet to firm up a bit, before storing.
