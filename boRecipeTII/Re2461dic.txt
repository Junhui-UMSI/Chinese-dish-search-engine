Good sale?  See that Veal or cut of Lamb?  Many things go with it.  This is  one varition.    Cut the meat as needed to fit in the crockpot, removing as much fat as  possible.  Now toss in the rest. Cook on high for 4 hours, then cool it and  skim off the fat.  Reheat and its good heated for 6 hours at a shot for 2  days.  (refridgerate inbetween times!) Serves well with an acorn or  buttternut squash, cut in half and baked then served in a bowl with the  shell filled with meat and soup.  Add rice (Basmati or Jasmine prefered)  and some blue lake green beans for a perfect but easy meal.    Nutrition:  High in fat, even when cooled and skimmed, but sugar free and  low in sodium.  Use as a specialty now and again even if dieting. Sastifies  sweet tooth with no sugar added.
