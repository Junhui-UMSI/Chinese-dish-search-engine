I  frequently adapt it to use cranberries. I keep cranberries in the freezer  year-round and love to throw them in anything I make with apples.    Put apples (and cranberries if youre using them) into a buttered baking  dish. Sprinkle with salt. Mix sugar, flour and butter until crumbly (I do  this in a food processor). Spread over the apples. Bake uncovered for 45  minutes in preheated 357 degree oven. Serve with ice cream or whipped  cream. This smells great while its baking, and its delicious! Its one of  our family favorites.    Note: I usually give the cranberries a quick chopping in the food processor  but it also works to use them whole. Depending on the quantity I need I  feel free to add more apples and cranberries and increase the amounts of  the other ingredients proportionately.
