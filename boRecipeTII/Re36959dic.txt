Heat oven to 325F. Remove rim from 8-inch springform pan and place 12-inch  square sheet of aluminum foil over bottom. Carefully replace rin, leaving  edges of foil outside pan. Smooth foil edges up over side of pan.  Generously coat inside of pan with nonstick vegetable cooking spray. Place  pan in 9-inch square baking pan and set aside.    In medium-size bowl, with wire whisk, beat eggs until frothy. Add yogurt  and beat until completely combined; pour into prepared pan. Pour hot water  into square pan to reach about 1 inch up side of spring-form pan.    Bake yogurt cake 50 to 60 minutes or until center appears set when pan is  gently tapped. Turn off oven and leave cake in oven 30 minutes longer.    Cool cake in pan on wire rack to room temperature. Refrigerate several  hours or overnight before cutting.    To serve, release and remove side of springform pan. Trim foil 1/2 inch  from edge of pan bottom and tuck under pan bottom. Place yogurt cake on  serving plate. Arrange strawberries, pointed tips up, on top and brush with  melted jelly. Surround cake with lemon thyme sprigs, if desired.    NOTES : Low-fat yogurt gives this easy, cheese-cake-like dessert the  smoothness and rich taste usually associated with high-fat, high-calories  sweets.
