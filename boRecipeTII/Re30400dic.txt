Banana Flip Bars
milk, Box Yellow Cake Mix, Eggs, FILLING, Crisco shortening, Box Instant Banana Pudding, Butter, 
Beat these ingredients together for 4 minutes. Line 1 jelly roll pan with  waxed paper thats been greased. Grease and flour another jelly roll pan.  Put half of batter in each pan. Bake 350 degrees for 10 minutes.    Filling: Whip these 2 ingredients together. Add 1 tsp banana extract and  whip again. Add 2 C Powdered Sugar and 1 T milk and whip until fluffy. Add  2 more C Powdered Sugar and if the mixture is to thick, add a small amount  of milk to make fluffy and spreadable.    Take 1 cake, add filling into center, put 2nd cake on top. Let set and then  cut into bars, however long or short, fat or thin you want them. Wrap each  separately and either put into refridgerator or in freezer to use at a  later date.    I usually make 2 sets of bars. One to freeze and one to eat. My daycare  kids call them their cool treats. I think your family will like them too!
