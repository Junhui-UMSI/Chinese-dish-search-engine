Tarragon Dove
Butter, White wine, Flour, frozen orange juice, Onions, -(up to), Dove breasts, Chicken broth, Dried tarragon, Sage, Apples, Lemon pepper, 
Place dove breasts in a 9x13 roasting pan, breasts up. Sprinkle liberally  with lemon pepper and lightly with tarragon and sage. Roast at 450? for 10  minutes. Remove from oven and turn breasts down. Add chicken stock to pan  and spoon the orange juice over the dove breasts. Add apples and onions.  Seal with foil. Bake at 325? for 30 minutes. Add wine, bake, resealed, for  another 30 minutes or until tender. Remove dove to platter briefly and  strain liquid into heavy saucepan. Return dove to pan and reseal to keep  warm (this can be done ahead). Reduce liquid over medium high heat to about  1-1/2 cups. With back of spoon, mix butter and flour and drop little balls  of this into reduced liquid, stirring constantly until sauce thickens to  your liking. Spoon over breasts placed on platter or serving plates.  Cooking time for dove will naturally depend on the age and size of the  birds. They should be tender but short of falling off the bone. Yield: 10  to 12 servings.    SHEILA FOSTER ANTHONY    (MRS. BERYL, JR.)    WASHINGTON, DC    From <Traditions: A Taste of the Good Life>, by the Little Rock (AR) Junior  League.
