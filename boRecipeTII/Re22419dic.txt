I found an old turtle cookie recipe, too.  This has to be at least 25 years  old, the scotch tape holding in my looseleaf book is brown with age. It is  called "The $25,000 Snappy Turtle Cookie", because it was the 1st prize  winner in the Pillsbury Bakeoff.  (Originally submitted by Mrs. Peter S.  Harlib, Chicago)    Sift together flour, soda and salt. Mix together, creaming well, the butter  and brown sugar.  Add the egg and yolk, reserving the white. Blend in the  vanilla and maple flavoring, and add the dry ingredients gradually; mix  thoroughly.    Arrange split pecan halves (rounded side up) in groups of three on greased  baking sheets to resemble head and legs of a turtle.    Mold the dough into balls (use rounded teaspoonful of dough for each). Dip  bottom into egg white and press onto nuts.    Bake in 350 degree oven 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool and frost generously.    Chocolate Frosting: Combine 2 squares (2 oz) chocolate or 1/33 cup  semi-sweet chocolate pieces, 1/4 cup milk and 1 T butter in top of double  boiler.  heat over boiling water until chocolate melts; blend until smooth.  Remove from heat; add 1 cup sifted confectioners sugar. Beat until smooth  and glossy.    I told you this was an OLD recipe.  I used to make this for my kids when  they were in school.  Their children are in school now!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #75    Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 21:31:30 -0800 (PST)    From: Dorothy Becker <dodi@u.washington.edu>
