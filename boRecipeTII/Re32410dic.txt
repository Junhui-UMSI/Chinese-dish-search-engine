Baron of Roast Beef
Basil, Red wine, Onions, Baron of beef, Beef broth, Dry mustard, Flour, Worcestershire Sauce, carrots, celery, thyme leaves, Bay leaf, 
The following is a recipe for roast beef taken from my Simply Delicious  Cooking 2 cookbook, just exchange the baron of beef for an equal weight rib  roast. Try to get a rib roast that is at least "aged" for 21-28 days, Never  buy any red meat from a local supermarket chain. they simply do not age it  long enough. You may begin your roast in the high oven for 10 minutes which  sears the meat and locks in the juices, then turn the oven down and  continue to cook as per instructions.    Preheat the oven to 325 F (160 C). Mix the flour, mustard and seasonings  together. Rub into the roast. Place roast into a roasting pan. Pour  Worcestershire over. Surround roast with the vegetables and bay leaf. Pour  in the red wine and water. Bake to desired doneness see chart below,  basting often. Use the pan juices to make gravy.
