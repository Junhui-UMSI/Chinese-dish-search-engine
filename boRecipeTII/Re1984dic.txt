Chocolate Walnut Clusters
(6 oz) semi-sweet chocolate, Walnut halves and large, 
Source: Diamond Walnuts    Melt chocolate over warm water stirring constantly. Add walnuts and stir  until coated. Drop in clusters on waxed paper. Cool (I find its best to  cool in the frig.) until set. Makes 1 coz. large clusters.    I have also make this recipes using peanuts and raisins instead of walnuts.  Its great for any kind of entertaining as candy like pieces.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by jblg@juno.com (Joy B Gardin) on Aug 4,  1998,
