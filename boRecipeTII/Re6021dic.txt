Pizelle
All-purpose flour, Sugar, Eggs, Vegetable oil, Salt, Baking Powder, Ground anise seed, Baking soda, 
In a large mixing bowl, blend the flour, sugar, anise seed, baking powder,  baking soda and salt.    In another bowl mix the oil and eggs. Stir the egg mixture into the dry  ingredients and mix until dough is smooth. Cover and chill 30 minutes.  Shape into 1-inch balls. Keep chilled.    Place the pizelle iron over medium heat. Heat on both sides until a drop of  water bounces and sizzles on an inside surface of the iron. Turn the iron  over occasionally during cooking to keep both surfaces hot.    Coat the heated iron on both sides of the interior surface with nonstick  cooking spray.    Place a ball of dough onto the center of the heated iron and flatten it  slightly by pressing it against the iron with your finger. Close the iron  and cook over medium heat 30 to 45 seconds, then turn over and cook on the  other side or until the pizelle is pale golden. Remove the pizelle from the  iron and cool on a wire rack.
