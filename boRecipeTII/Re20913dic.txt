I have not made these yet--but glad to find a fatfree muffin recipe. This  is from Dr. Andrew Weils latest book and the recipe is also posted at his  web site.    Heat oven to 325? F. Lightly oil muffin tin. Peel and core apples and chop  coarsely. Set aside.    In a separate bowl, sift together pastry flour, white flour, oat bran,  baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg.    Add thawed apple-juice concentrate, chopped apples, and enough water to  make a light batter.    Mix just enough to moisten all ingredients. Divide batter among the muffin  cups (makes 12) and bake till lightly browned, 25-30 minutes.    Remove muffins from cups while hot.
