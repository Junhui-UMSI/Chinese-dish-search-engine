Basic Fresh Pasta Dough
Unbleached flour, olive oil, Eggs, Semolina, Salt, 
PLACE ALL ingredients except egg into a food processor. Add the egg a bit  at a time while pulsing. When the dough forms into pellets, youve added  enough eggs. Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead together into a  stiff mass. Let rest for 15 minutes before rolling into pasta.
