To make annatto oil: Place the annatto seeds in a dry pan and toast over  medium heat. Keep shaking the pan and tossing the seeds until their aroma  is released, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the vegetable oil and set aside. When  cool, strain to remove seeds. Heat the annatto and olive oils in a large  skillet. Add the onion, chile, garlic, red peppers, recao and cilantro.  SautJ over medium heat until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in  the tomato paste and continue cooking for 2 more minutes. Add the tomatoes  and cook two more minutes. Allow to cool, then transfer mixture to a food  processor or blender and puree. Pour marinade into a large bowl and stir in  vinegar. Add remaining marinade ingredients. Place the ribs in the marinade  and allow to sit for at least 1 hour, or overnight. Preheat oven to 350  degrees. Remove the ribs from the marinade and place them in a baking pan  single layer (save marinade for basting). Add 1/4inch water to the pan,  cover and bake for one hour. Uncover and bake for another hour, basting  with the reserved marinade every 15 minutes.
