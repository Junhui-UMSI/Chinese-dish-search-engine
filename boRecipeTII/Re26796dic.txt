Baked Apples W/ Maple Yogurt Sauce
Maple syrup, Cinnamon, SAUCE, Raisins, Yogurt, low-fat, Brown Sugar, Apples *, Nutmeg, Maple syrup, 
* A large, firm, tart apple is best. Use Ida Red or Northern Spy. A  Cortland can be used. However, if you use a McIntosh, you must shorten the  cooking time.     Core apples and remove top inch of peel. Make a shallow out through skin  around centre of each apple to prevent skin from bursting. Place apples  upright in baking dish or pie plate. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar,  raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg and syrup. Spoon into centres of each apple. Add  water to cover bottom of dish. Bake, uncovered in 375 F for 25 to 30  minutes for less firm apples and up to 50 minutes for firm varieties or  until apples are tender when pierced with a toothpick.     SAUCE: Combine the yogurt and maple syrup to make the sauce. Pour over the  baked apples.  Posted to recipelu-digest by jeryder@juno.com (Judy E Ryder) on Mar 03,  1998
