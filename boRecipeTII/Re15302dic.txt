For the beans: soak beans overnight in water to cover. Drain. Over low  heat, stir peppers and onions in olive oil for one minute. Add beans and  saute over medium heat for about five minutes, stirring constantly. Add  stock, garlic, cumin and chili powder. Simmer, uncovered, until beans are  soft...about 1 1/2 hours, adding more broth as necessary. Stir in tomatoes  about 20 minutes before beans are done and season to taste with salt and  pepper. To roast chicken: Crack the breast bones to flatten. Rub breasts  with oil and season with remaning ingredients. Roast in preheated  350-degree oven about 30 minutes, being sure not to overcook. Cool slightly  and remove meat from bones. To serve: Place a generous generous portion of  beans in a large, flat soup bowl. Slice chicken thinly, keeping skin on,  and place on top of beans. Garnish with salsa, sour cream, cilantro and a  warm quesadilla. To make quesadillas, top a soft flour tortilla with about  1/4 cup of grated cheddar cheese, two tablespoons of sour cream ad hot  peppers to taste. Fold each into quarters and warm through in a 350 degree  oven.    NOTES :    This is the way the recipe was written. I used boneless,  skinless chicken breasts, cubed. I shook them in a bag with the oil, then  the herbs and spices, cooked them in the microwave, then put them in the  beans to finish the cooking. It was delicious, and much more like chili, to  our gang.  Recipe by: AP Wire    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1033 by ARoss <ross415@seark.net> on Jan 23,  1998
