Almond Paste
(about 1 3/4 cups) whole, Sugar, Light corn syrup, Almond extract, Water, 
Here is a recipe for Almond Paste from the book "Secrets of A Jewish Baker"  by George Greenstein.  It is really a treasure trove of how tos. This is  one recipe I have yet to try.    Grind the almonds and 2 tablespoons of the water in a food processor until  the mixture has a smooth texture when rubbed between your fingers.    Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of water in a heavy saucepan.  Add the  sugar and corn syrup. Heat the mixture slowly until the sugar melts, then  bring it to a boil. Cover and boil for 3 minutes.    Remove the lid but do not stir the mixture.  Heat the mixture to 240  degrees F (soft ball stage). (You may find it helpful to use a candy  thermometer) Remove the pan from the heat and add the almond extract.    With the food processor running, slowly add the hot syrup to the almonds  until the paste forms a ball.    When almond paste is cool, place in a sealable plastic bag or tightly  covered container and refrigerate. Allow to season for one week. Bring to  room temperature before using.
