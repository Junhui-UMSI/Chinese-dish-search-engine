Watkins Caramel Apple Dip
WATKINS Vanilla, Cream cheese, Caramel Extract, Brown sugar, 
You can use lite or regular cream cheese. I like the already creamed  variety.  Brown sugar can be increase to 1/3 cup if preferred.  As far as I  know only Watkins makes Caramel Extract.    Mix well all ingredients until very smooth and creamy.  Chill and serve  with sliced apples.  Sliced pears and green seedless grapes are also good  with this dip.  Remember to treat apples with either lemon juice or some  sort of commercial product that prevents sliced apples from turning brown.    This is one of our most popular tasties.  Everyone who tastes it, requests  the recipe.    Formatted for MM by: Diana Eichman    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
