Place chocolate in a double boiler and heat over hot water until it melts.  Stir to blend and let cool to room temperature.    Microwave almonds and butter for crust for 1 minute.  Stir dry crust  ingredients together in 9" springform pan.  Add butter and nuts and pat  firmly onto bottom. Grease sides of pan.    With an electric mixer, blend cheese and sugar until smooth.  Mix in eggs,  vanilla, and sour cream.  Stir in melted chocolate.  NOTE: it is important  to have the cheesecake ingredients and the melted chocolate close to the  same temperature when they are combined so that they blend together  smoothly.  Pour into pan.  Put another pan with water into the preheated  oven. This will prevent the top of the cheesecake from cracking. Bake in  the middle of a preheated 325F oven for 45 minutes or until just barely  set.  Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar, and let cool in oven for 1  hour longer. Chill. Just before serving, dust cocoa through a sieve making  a ring around the cheesecake.    Prepare raspberry sauce:  Reserve 1/2 cup raspberries for garnish.  In a  blender, puree the remaining berries and push through a sieve.  Stir in  sugar to taste and the Grand Marnier.  To serve, spoon raspberry sauce on  to desert plates. Remove pan sides of cheesecake and cut into wedges. Place  on raspberry sauce and garnish with berries.
