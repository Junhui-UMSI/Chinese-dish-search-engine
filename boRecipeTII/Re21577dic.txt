Apple Puffs (Deep Fried)
Baking Powder, Flour, milk, Sugar, Powdered sugar, apples, Egg, 
We had the Honey Cornmeal Biscuits for supper this evening and oh, are they  delicious. Heres a recipe for Apple Puffs from Elva Curl. Ive been having  trouble retrieving my messages the last couple of days, only getting a few  at a time, so I hope this gets out.    Mix flour, baking powder, sugar and apples. Add egg and milk and mix well.  Drop by spoonfuls into hot fat and cook until puffs are golden brown. Drain  and roll in sugar while warm.
