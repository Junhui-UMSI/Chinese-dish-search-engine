Whitefish Salad (D)
Smoked whitefish, Black Pepper, Sour cream, approximately, Garnish, sprigs of fresh, Mayonnaise, heaping, Chopped parsley *, Stalks celery, strings, Dill and or parsley, Snipped fresh dill *, 
Keeping the skin of the whitefish intact and the head still attached,  carefully remove the bones from the whitefish and place the meat in a  mixing bowl.    Dice the celery and combine with the whitefish, along with 1 cup of the  sour cream, the mayonnaise, and the pepper. Add the dill and parsley and as  much more sour cream as is wanted.    Stuff the mixture back into the skin of the whitefish, remaking the shape  of a fish. Garnish with additional dill and parsley    Elaines Note: I use the dill, parsley as a garnish only, we like our salad  straight. I also chunk the salad, and do not mush the fish.
