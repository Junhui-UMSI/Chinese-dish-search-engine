Let  the potato mixture cool a little, then toss with the artichokes, eggs and  seasonings. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet, add the mixture and  cook slowly for 5 minutes. Slide out onto a plate, reverse back into the  pan and let brown for another 5 minutes. Serve lukewarm or cold, cut in  wedges.
