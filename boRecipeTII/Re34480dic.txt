I make a huge bowl each week and nibble it when I get  the munchies    Drain and rinse the beans very, very well.  Mix in all ingredients and pour  on seasoned rice vinegar.  I usually use 1/2 a cup.  Let it sit for at  least a couple of hours (it tastes best the next day). Its so simple yet so  good.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #175    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
