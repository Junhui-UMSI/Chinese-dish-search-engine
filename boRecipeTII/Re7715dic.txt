Dried Lima beans, Black Pepper, Pork butt; cut into 2" cubes, Salt, Corn kernels, Red peppers; seeded & diced, Vegetable oil, Caraway seeds, Chicken Stock, Salt, Plain yogurt, Onion; finely diced, 
PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. In a Dutch oven or heavy 3-quart pot, heat the oil  over high heat on top of the stove, add the pork in batches and brown very  well. Do not crowd or the meat will not brown. Remove and reserve the meat  on a plate as it is browned. Discard the fat in the pot. Lower flame, add  the onion and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes to dissolve the browned bits  that have stuck to the bottom of the pot. Return the meat to the pot, add  the stock, beans and caraway. Cover and place in oven for 1 1/2 hours or  until pork is tender and the beans are cooked. Transfer pot to the top of  the stove. Add salt, corn and peppers. Cook, uncovered, over high heat for  5 minutes to thicken the liquid in the pot. Stir constantly. Remove from  heat and stir in the yogurt. Add the salt and freshly ground pepper to  taste.
