Utensils: flour sifter, rubber spatula, measuring spoons, two 8-inch round  cake pan, measuring cups electric mixer and bowl, serrated knife    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    2. Grease and flour the cake pans (rub bottom of pan with butter or  shortening, then sprinkle flour in the pan; tap the pan until flour spreads  and covers pan bottom)    3. Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into the electric mixer  bowl.    4. Add the shortening, milk, vanilla, and eggs. Mix on low speed for one  minute.    5. Scrape the sides of the bowl, then turn mixer to high speed. Beat for 3  minutes.    6. Pour into pans and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden pick  inserted in the cake center comes out clean (not sticky!).    7. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn cake layers onto a wire rack (you  might need help with this step).    Cream Cheese Frosting:    1. Place the cream cheese, milk, vanilla, and salt in the electric mixer  bowl. Mix on medium speed until well blended.    2. Gradually add sugar, beating at medium to high speed until the frosting  is smooth and will spread easily. If necessary, add more milk.    3. Cut the cooled cake and arrange as shown in the drawing. One layer is  left intact, and the other is cut to form the bunnys ears and bow tie.  Spread the frosting between the head, ear, and bow tie pieces, then over  top and sides.    4. Add jelly beans for the bunnys eyes, strips of licorice for whiskers.  You could also cover the rabbit with coconut for a very special Easter  dessert!
