From: Moosewood Restaurant Low-Fat Favorites (1996)    This is a very easy-to-make, quick-cooking soup with readily available  ingredients that are found in almost every pantry. Here a light tomato  broth is made hearty with the addition of bulgur. The soup tends to thicken  as it sits, so if you arent serving it immediately, you may want to add a  bit of water or stock.    Serves 4 to 6 Total time: 30 minutes    In a large soup pot, combine the vegetable stock, onions, carrots, celery,  garlic, salt, dill, and fennel. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover,  and simmer gently for about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and their  juice. Add the bulgur and mix well. Return to a boil and simmer, covered,  for another 15 minutes, or until the bulgur is tender, stirring  occasionally. Add pepper to taste.    [I served each bowl with a wedge of lemon to be squeezed into the soup as  desired.]    Per 9-oz. serving: 78 cal., 2.9 g prot., .5 g fat, 17.2 g carb., .1 g sat.  fatty acids, .1 g polyunsat. fatty acids, .1 g monounsat. fatty acids, 0 mg  chol., 538 mg sod., 3.4 g total dietary fiber    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n084 by "BrownleeS" <BrownleeS@dsmo.com> on  Mar 28, 97
