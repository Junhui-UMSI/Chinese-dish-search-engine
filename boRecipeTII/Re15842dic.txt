Acapulco Baked Eggs
Butter or margarine, (4-oz) green chiles; chopped, Sliced tomatoes for garnish, milk, Pepper, Extra-sharp cheddar;, Tomato sauce; ketchup or, Eggs, Salt, 
These recipes come from Culinary Cyber Sleuth. The first one has no chiles  but think they would make a wonderful addition and it sounds great for a  special holiday occasion, as does the 2nd one.    Put butter in 8-inch square baking pan. Set pan in 350 degree oven to melt.  Shake pan to distribute butter evenly. Slightly beat eggs, milk, salt and  pepper. Pour into pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or until eggs  begin to set. Sprinkle with cheese and chiles. Draw a wide metal spatula  across bottom of pan several times to break up mixture. Bake, breaking up  mixture again several times for 5 more minutes or until of desired  doneness. Serve with tomato sauce, ketchup or chili sauce, if used. Garnish  with sliced tomatoes.
