This came from "Insights" magazine, a local publication for the top of  Virginia. The recipe is from Chef Frederick Petrello, owner of Candeloras  restaurant in Lovettsville, Virginia. Ive never eaten there, but I can say  if this recipe is indicitative of his cuisine, I sure would like to try  it....    DAY 1: Cut off bottom of mushroom stems to remove dirt, and wash the  mushroom caps. In a deep dish, make the marinade by whisking the following  ingredients: olive oil; chopped garlic, parsley, scallions, leeks, oregano,  and basil. Lay the mushrooms, cap side down, in the marinade and  refrigerate.    DAT 2: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Preheat oven-proof skillet. Remove the  mushrooms from the marinade and put them into the skillet. Add 2 oz butter  and saute the mushrooms until brown. Remove the skillet from thee heat and  add the marinade and chicken broth. Place skillet in the oven until the  mushrooms are tender, about 7-10 minutes, depending on the size of the  mushrooms. Serve with a garnish of Parmesan cheese and parsley.    What I did... I didnt have an oven proof skillet, so after I browned the  mushrooms, I transferred them to a preheated Corning Ware oblong casserole.    I used freshly grated Parmesan...lots of it.    I made waaaay too much. I figured two mushrooms per person....one was more  than enough. But the leftovers were great...see the next message.    Too many leftovers? Well next day both the kid and the boyfriend took a  mushroom each out of the fridge. They nuked it in the microwave for about a  minute, and then put it on a hamburger bun...and ate it just like a  hamburger!!!!    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H.
