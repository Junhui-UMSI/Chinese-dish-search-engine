Pumpkin Face Jell-O
Orange flavored gelatin, Black licorice; cut into, 
Line small bowls, about 3 to 4 ounces, with plastic wrap. Prepare the  gelatin according to package instructions. Put a small amount of gelatin in  the prepared bowl and let it partially set in the refrigerator. Remove the  gelatin from the refrigerator and push the pieces of licorice into the  mixture to resemble eyes and a mouth. Cover with a little more gelatin and  let set. Once set, fill the bowls with remaining gelatin and chill until  solid. To unmold, invert the bowl onto a plate. Remove the bowl and  carefully peel away the plastic wrap.
