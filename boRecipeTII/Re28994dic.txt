Halve the peaches, pull out the stones carefully and place a square of  chocolate in the hollow of each peach half. Put the peaches in a baking  dish, spoon over a little of the liqueur and bake in a preheated oven (200  C or 400 F) for 10 minutes, until the fruit is soft and the chocolate has  melted.
