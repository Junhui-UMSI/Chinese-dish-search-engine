It should work equally  well if hand kneaded the "old-fashioned" way. The bagels are chewy on the  outside but not soggy or doughy on the inside. I slice them after they have  cooled and store them in sealed plastic bags in the freezer.    Place dough ingredients in bread machine per mfrs directions.  Set bread  machine on "dough" cycle.    When machine signals, remove dough to well floured surface.  Cut into 8  equal pieces and shape to make "doughnuts".  Cover and let rest 20 minutes.    In a large kettle, bring about a gallon of water with 1 Tblsp sugar to  simmer.  Set oven at 500 degrees.    After bagels have rested 20 minutes, put in 500 degree oven for total of 5  minutes, turning once after 3 minutes.  Remove bagels.  Reduce oven setting  to      350    degrees.    Place 3 bagels in simmering water for total of 5 minutes, turning after  three minutes.  Remove 3 bagels from water.  Drain on paper towel while  simmering remaining bagels.    Place simmered bagels on greased (Pam) baking sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees  about 25 minutes until brown.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #108    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
