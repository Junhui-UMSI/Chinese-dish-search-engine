TOO HOT TAMALES SHOW #TH 6219    In a mortar and pestle or a food processor, combine the garlic, salt,  ginger and cardamom and pound to a smooth paste. Add the vermouth and the  lime juice and whisk to mix. Allow to sit for 5 minutes, then add the  sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Rub this mixture into both  sides of the tuna steaks and allow to sit at room temperature for about 15  minutes.    Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over  medium-high heat. Add the bacon and saute, stirring, until crisp. Add the  onions and continue to saute, stirring frequently, until the onions are  golden. Add the sliced garlic and cook for 1 minute more, until the aroma  of the garlic is released. Add the chiles, vinegar, tomatoes, thyme,  oregano, and salt and cook only until the tomatoes are heated through.    Preheat a grill or broiler to high heat. Grill the steaks about 4 inches  away from the heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden and cooked to the  desired doneness. Let rest for 5 minutes.    Cover the bottom of a heated serving platter with the braised onion  mixture. Arrange the tuna steaks on top and surround them with the tomato  wedges. Scatter the parsley over the top and serve immediately.    Yield: 6 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Mar 16, 1998
