With a sharp knife, slice  bagel into very thin slices so that you can almost see through them (you'll  get about 10 slices). Place slices on a baking sheet. Lightly spray with  cooking spray. Quickly sprinkle in a small amount of seasoning (a little  goes a long way) or leave plain. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes until lightly browned-be careful; they burn easily. Break each slice into 4 chips.
