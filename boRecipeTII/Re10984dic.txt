"The colors and aromas -- the deep magenta leaves of radicchio, the rich  flavor of walnuts, and the golden hue and pungent fragrance of ripe cheese,  make this a winter dish. The ingredients are tossed in a mustard-spiked  dressing on top of large, thin slices of garlicky grilled bread, and each  person is served a piece of bread with its share of salad."    Lightly grill or toast the bread and rub one side of each slice with the  cut clove of garlic.    Line a seving dish with the grilled bread and distribute the radicchio over  the bread slices. Top with the Gruyere cheese shavings and sprinkle with  chopped walnuts.    In a small bowl combine the olive oil, vinegar, mustard, and salt and  pepper to taste. Beat with a fork until well blended.    Pour the dressing over the salad and carefully toss the salad on top of the  bread, using it as a base. Correct the seasonings. Each person is served a  piece of grilled bread topped with salad.
