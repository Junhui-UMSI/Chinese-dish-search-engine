Preheat oven to 400F and prepare 12 muffin cups. Sift first 4 ingredients  of dry mixture together. With a pastry blender cut peanut butter and butter  into dry mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a medium bowl  beat eggs lightly and stir in buttermilk. Add egg milk-mixture to coarse  crumbs mixture and stir just until ingredients are blended. Fill 12  prepared muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake 20-25 minutes in preheated oven. While  muffins are cooking melt the jelly and finely chop the peanuts. As soon as  muffins are removed from the oven brush the tops with melted jelly and dip  the tops into the chopped peanuts.
