Pickled Fish with Coconut Milk
Thick coconut milk, Smelts, dressed, Tumeric (optional), Salt, Vinegar, 
I have two smelts recipes that are really easy and lowfat (except for the  coconut milk -- see if you can find the lowfat kind) and delicious if you  like that tangy vinegar taste. These are Filipino recipes and so are meant  to be eaten with steamed rice. These are both from Marilyn Donatos  _Philippine Cooking in America_.    Marinate fish in vinegar, salt and tumeric for at least 1 hour. Bring to a  boil and simmer covered for 5 minutes. Add coconut milk and simmer 5  minutes more. Serves 3.
