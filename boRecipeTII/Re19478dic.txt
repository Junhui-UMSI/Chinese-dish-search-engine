Vegetarian Pancakes
Piping-hot applesauce, Egg substitute (see note), Water; or as needed, Salt, Baking Powder, Water, White flour (bleached; or, -(up to), Sugar, 
Combine well the first 4 (dry) ingredients in a large bowl.     In a second bowl, mix the egg substitute with the 1/2 cup water.  Beat  with a mixer on high setting till it thickens somewhat - about 60-90  seconds. This is the egg substitute powder available in Whole Foods stores  and other health-food stores (does not contain any egg product).     Warm-up the applesauce (microwave works well for this)     Combine the egg-substitute and applesauce in the large bowl with the dry  ingredients.  Now add enough additional water (about 1 or 1.5 cup) until  consistency is typical for batter.     From this point on, cook in a pan or on griddle as with any other pancake  batter.     P.S.  Ive found that the egg-substitute really works great as long as it  is beaten well with an electric mixer.  Also, I try to use applesauce  frequently in baked stuff as a fat/oil replacement - it actually seems to  work okay in pancakes...    GAWILSON@VNET.IBM.COM    (GALE A.
