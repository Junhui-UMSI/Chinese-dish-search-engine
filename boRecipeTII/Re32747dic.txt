Sweet potato, Fresh gingerroot, Butter, Sugar, Egg, Sesame seeds, Nutmeg, Active dry yeast, Dry milk; nonfat, Coarse salt, Orange rind, Flour; all - purpose, 
In a medium - size bowl dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.  Combine the sugar and dry milk with 1 cup of warm water and add to the  yeast along with the grated ginger, orange rind, salt, and nutmeg. Whip the  butter into the mashed potatoes and combine with yeast mixture. Stir the  flour in and then beat the mixture for 1 minute. Cover the bowl with  plastic wrap and place over a pan of warm water to rise until double in  volume, about 45 minutes.    Tum out onto a floured work surface, punch down, and knead very lightly a  few turns. Pull off pieces of dough slightly smaller than a Ping - Pong  ball and, since they will be very sticky, just roll lightly with floured  hands to form a ball. Arrange on one or two greased baking sheets large  enough to hold the three dozen rolls side by side without crowding. Cover  with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Paint  with the beaten egg and sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Bake in a preheated  350 - degree oven for 25 minutes. Serve warm.
