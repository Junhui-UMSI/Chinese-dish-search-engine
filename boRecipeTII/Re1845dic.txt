Chicken Supreme
Sliced celery, Sliced carrots, Sour Supreme, Chicken breast fillets;, All-purpose flour, Salt, Pepper, Paprika, Margarine, Oil; if needed, White wine or water, Chicken bouillon powder, Poultry seasoning, Bay leaf, Mushrooms, Diced onions, 
Mix together flour, salt, pepper, and paprika. Rinse chicken, pat dry, and  drege in this mixture. Melt 2 Tbsp. margarine (and 2 Tbsp. oil) and brown  chicken on both sides. Set chicken aside. Melt remaining 2 Tbsps. margarine  in pan and stir in remaining flour mixture till smooth. Add wine or water  and stir till smooth. Add remaining ingredients except the Sour Supreme and  place chicken back in pan. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes till chicken is  cooked through. Remove chicken to platter. Stir Sour Supreme into pan and  heat through. Pour sauce over chicken and serve.    What I have done sometimes for Shabbos or Yom Tov is to brown the chicken,  make the sauce AND stir in the Sour Supreme right away. Then I pour the  completed sauce mixture over the chicken, cover it, and put it on the  blech.    For Shavous I quadrupled the recipe. I made the chicken and the sauce,  mixed in the Sour Supreme, poured it over the chicken, covered it, and  refrigerated it. Saturday night we took it out and put it on the blech. It  warmed evenly and was delicious!    The problem when you enlarge the recipe is that you need a certain amount  of flour mixture left over after the dredging to thicken the sauce, so you  have to enlarge the flour mixture in proper proportion. And also the frying  pan gets really grungy with burned flour after frying so many pieces of  chicken. I have to stop a few times and wash out the pan, add fresh  margarine (and oil), and start again.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Kaplan Consulting Corp.
