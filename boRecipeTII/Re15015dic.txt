West Indian Masala
Cumin seeds, Fennel seeds, Coriander seeds, Turmeric, Black mustard seeds, Fenugreek seeds, Jamaican allspice, 
Roast all the seeds in a large pan in a 350F oven until they begin  popping. Place a cookie sheet on top of the pan and roast for an additional  8 minutes, taking care not to burn the seeds. Cool the seeds and grind them  together in a spice mill to a fine powder. Add the turmeric and allspice,  if using, and mix well.    The lack of chilies is typical of the eastern Caribbean where hot sauces  rather than curry powder is expected to provide the heat.
