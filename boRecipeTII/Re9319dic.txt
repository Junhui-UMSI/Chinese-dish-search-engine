Puff Pastry Pizza
tomatoes, Puff pastry, Spices, Muenster cheese, 
From: Elizabeth Brydone-Jack <bbrydone@earthlink.net>    Variation-add any of your favorite pizza toppings. I have tried mushrooms &  they were wonderful.    Preheat oven to 350 fahrenheit or to temperature on puff pastry package.  Defrost puff pastry so that it is pliable & its a good idea to smooth out  the creases. Place pastry on greased sheet (I use cooking spray to save on  calories) & fold up corners of pastry to form a box-like structure that  will hold in your toppings. Spray pastry with cooking spray & fill  structure with diced tomatoes & cheese. Add spices to your taste. Cook in  oven until pastry is brown. Cut into square and serve hot. It disappears  pretty quickly & doesnt store well, so thats a good thing!    Posted to recipelu-digest by jeryder@juno.com on Mar 29, 1998
