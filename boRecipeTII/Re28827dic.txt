Philpott" <colonel@korat1.vu-korat.ac.th>  Every Thai restaurant has a "condiment set" of four or five little pots,  known in Thai as kruang prung (often stainless steel).    These are filled with: 1: sugar 2: phom prik (ground dried red birdseye  chilis) 3: nam pla prik (1 part sliced green birdseye chilis to 4 parts  fish     sauce, marinated for a week) 4: prik dong (1 part sliced red birdseye  chilis, in four parts     rice vinegar, marinated for a week) 5: prik siyu wan (one part sliced  green Thai jalapenos in four parts     dark sweet soy sauce, marinated for a week).    These are added liberally to every dish as the diner requires.    Bottles of fish sauce, dark soy, sweet soy, and sometimes oyster sauce and  hot sauce are added.    A sweet sauce (consisting of finely sliced red birdseye chilis, chopped  garlic and grated ginger in sugar syrup), is also often found.    I am sure you can produce a generally Tex-mex variant, or whatever is  locally appropriate.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #019    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
