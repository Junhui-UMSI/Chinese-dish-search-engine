In a 6 quart or larger, oven proof pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over  medium-high heat; then brown the meat on all sides. Drain off any excess  fat. Add the water, juice, honey and brown sugar, and cover the pot. Bring  to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Toward the end  of this time, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Randomly arrange carrots, sweet  potatoes, squash, prunes and apricots around and on top of meat.Cover pot  and transfer to oven. Bake for 1 1/2 hours; uncover pot and bake for  additional 1 - 2 hours, or until roast is fork-tender. Use a slotted spoon  to remove vegetables and fruit from the pot and put them in a serving bowl.  Transfer roast to platter or carving board. If sauce in pot is too thin,  either boil it down to desired consistency, or use a thickener. For the  latter, combine 1 tablespoon each of cornstarch and cold water, and stir  the mixture into the hot broth; then bring the sauce to a boil. If  necessary, add more thickener until desired consistency of sauce is  reached.    Cut the roast into thick slices against the grain of the meat. Pour some of  the sauce over the meat and vegetables. Serve the remainder on the side in  a sauceboat or small pitcher.
