Cook  bacon until crisp and remove it from the skillet.  Pour off all off all but  one tablespoon of the fat remaining in the skillet.  Cook the onion in the  remaining fat until the onion is transparent.  Crumble the bacon and  sprinkle the bacon, onion and cheeses over the inside of the partly baked  pastry. Combine the eggs, cream, nutmeg, salt and pepper and strain over  the onion-cheese mixture. Bake fifteen minutes at 450 F. Reduce the oven  temperature to moderate, 350 F., and bake until a knife inserted on inch  from the pastry edge comes out clean, about 10 minutes longer.
