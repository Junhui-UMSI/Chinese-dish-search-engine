In a large kettle, bring water and margarine to boiling. Slowly add cereals  and cook, stirring constantly until the mixture is fully cooked and thick.  Remove from heat.    Add peanut butter and desired amount of chopped fruit, nuts and seeds. Cool  and place in plastic containers. [Personal note: pack the stuff into  chopped off chunks of discarded panty hose.] Hang the mixture in protected  crooks of trees. You can also spread the mixture onto a place (dont use  aluminum pans; when its freezing, little bird feet can stick to the metal  and suffer injury), set out on ground or picnic bench.    By placing the food at different elevations, you will attract many species  of birds. The food can be preserved in a freezer (if there is any left  over). Just be sure to use it within three to four months.    Dont forget: birds need plenty of fresh drinking water. A word of warning:  DO NOT use additives such as glycerine, oils or alcohol to prevent  freezing. These substances may kill bids or make them sick. Keep water  bowls from freezing either by changing them frequently or heating them with  warm water. There are electrical heating devices available, but we suggest  they not be used for wildlife.
