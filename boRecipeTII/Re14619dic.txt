Cut tomatoes and layer on top of avocado.  Mix 1 cup of mayo with the  2 taco seasoning mixes and layer on top of tomatoes. Slice olives and layer  on top of mayo mixture. Spread cheddar cheese over the top. Chill for 2  hours. Serve with nacho chips ( I use "Grandaddys" unsalted tortilla  chips)    EAT-L Digest 11 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
