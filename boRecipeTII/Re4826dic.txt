Pick of the Season Cherry Ale

This  recipe makes 5-1/2 gallons. Freeze cherries a couple  days  before  brewing. Defrost in the fridge.  While wort is boiling, remove stems and  crush cherries. After boiling, pour wort over cherries in fermenter. Add  cold  water  and pitch yeast. After a couple days,  rack  to  secondary,  straining out cherries. I decided to use lactose because several people  thought  Papazians Cherries in the Snow was a bit dry. Primary Ferment: 2  days Secondary Ferment: 6--8 weeks    Recipe By     : Andy Wilcox    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
