Baking Powder Biscuits
Salt, Shortening, All-purpose flour*, Baking Powder, milk, 
Heat oven to 450 F. Cut shortening into flour, baking powder and salt with  pastry blender until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in just enough  milk so dough leaves side of bowl and rounds up into a hail. (Too much milk  makes dough sticky; not enough milk makes biscuits dry.)    Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 10 times. Roll or  pat to 1/2 inch thick. Cut with floured 2-inch biscuit cutter. Place on  ungreased cookie sheet about 1 inch apart for crusty sides, touching for  soft sides.    Bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Immediately remove from cookie  sheet.    *If using self-rising flour, omit baking powder and salt.
