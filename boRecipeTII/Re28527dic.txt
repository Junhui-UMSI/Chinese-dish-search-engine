Tex-Mex Beans n Rice
Cayenne, Cumin, Can green chiles, chopped, Onion, Red bell pepper, chopped,, Green bell pepper, chopped, Black beans, Garbanzo beans (chickpeas), 
"Saute" the onion in a little water, until it has browned slightly (I tend  to brown it, then add the water to un-stick it from the bottom of the pan).  Add in the peppers, one type at a time; heat through. Drain the beans,  reserving a little of the liquid (not a lot -- its pretty salty), rinse  the beans and add them to the pot. Add in some of the bean liquid and some  water, until its  somewhat soupy.  Heat thoroughly. Before its done, add  cumin and cayenne to taste (we like LOTS of cumin, and a touch of cayenne  for a bit of byte).    While this was all cooking, you should also have a pot of rice on to cook.  Serve the resulting bean concoction over the rice.    From:    Faith Senie <fms@sw.stratus.com> Submitted By DONNA WEBSTER  <DONNA@WEBSTER.DEMON.CO.UK> On MON, 20 NOV 1995 153915 GMT
