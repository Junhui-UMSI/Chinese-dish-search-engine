Combine first 3 ingredients in a large bowl, and cut in chilled margarine  with a pastry blender. Combine milk and egg yolk; add to flour mixture,  stirring until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface,  and knead lightly 3 to 4 times. Wrap in heavy-duty plastic wrap, and chill        1    hour.    Place dates and next 5 ingredients in food processor; process until smooth.  Set date mixture aside.    Combine egg white and water; beat with a wire whisk, and set aside. Divide  dough in half; cover and refrigerate half of dough. Turn the remaining half  of dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and roll to 1/8-inch  thickness; cut into 18 rounds, using a 3-inch cutter.    Working with 1 round at a time, gently grasp opposite edges, and pull into  an oval shape. Moisten the edges of the dough with egg white mixture. Spoon  1 teaspoon date mixture onto half of each oval. Fold dough over filling;  seal edges by pressing with a fork dipped in flour. Carefully place on  baking sheets coated with cooking spray; brush tops with egg white mixture,  and sprinkle with 1-1/2 teaspoons sugar. Repeat procedure with the  remaining dough, date mixture, egg white mixture, and remaining 1-1/2  teaspoons sugar.    Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
