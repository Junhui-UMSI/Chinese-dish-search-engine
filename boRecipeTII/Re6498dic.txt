Poached Crockpot Chicken
Broiler-fryer; (3 lbs.), salt and pepper, Piece celery; (2"), Carrot, Chicken broth, Onion, Bay leaf, 
Wash the chicken and pat dry. Place it in the crockpot; season with salt  and pepper. Place the celery, carrot and onion around the chicken. Pour in  the broth. Add the bay leaf. Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 8 hours or till  the chicken is tender. Lift the chicken from the pot and let it cool until  it is cool enough to handle. Now remove the meat from the chicken and  freeze what youre not going to eat that night. You can also strain the  stock and refrigerate it. Chill overnight and skim off the fat. Now you  will also have delicious chicken broth and can use some of the chicken  mixed with the broth for soup, or you can use the chicken in any dish  calling for cooked chicken, and freeze the broth for later use.
