Tropical Chicken
Chicken; quartered parts, Estee granulated fructose, Lemon juice, Dry mustard powder, Pineapple; crushed  packed, 
The recipe, as POSTED (a rose by any other name....) was published by  Hidden Valley about 10 years ago, and Im not sure that the low fat version  was available at the time. Since it is being used, in this case, primarily  as a seasoning, I see no reason why the low fat would not work. As to the  eggs, their main purpose is to hold the seasoning to the chicken. Again, I  think that the whites alone would do the job. I also came across another  chicken recipe that may be of interest to you. Mix pineapple with its  juice, fructose, lemon juice and mustard in small bowl. Place chicken on  rack in shallow baking pan. Spread pineapple mixture over each piece of  chicken (approx 2 tablespoons each). Bake for 20 minutes, then remove from  oven to baste again. Bake 20 minutes and baste again. Return to oven for  final 20 minutes of baking. Pour pineapple sauce and drippings from baking  pan into bowl and chill. Skim fat, then return to sauce pan to reheat.  Serve sauce over chicken.
