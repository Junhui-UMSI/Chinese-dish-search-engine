Kats Cranberry-Port Relish
Fresh or frozen cranberries, Onion, minced, Cider vinegar, Golden raisins, Granulated white sugar, Port, Ground nutmeg, Ground ginger (I use, Candied Ginger, instead) REB, Ground cinnamon, 
In a 3-4 quart pan, combine cranberries, onion, vinegar, raisins, port,  nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon. Bring quickly to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Simmer uncovered while stirring often until mixture is reduced to about 3  cups, about 30 minutes. Again, stir frequently to avoid scorching.    Let cool.    If you can make this a couple of days before its eaten, and refrigerate  it, its flavor will be at its best.
