Persian Grated Apples
Crushed ice, Paper thin slices peeled, Fruit sugar, Rose water, Sweet apples, Lemon, 
Simple, but a true conversation piece. The first time I ate them, they were  covered with red rose petals. Peel the apples and grate into a clear glass  bowl. Stir in the lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Add sugar, rose  water, and mix gently. Cover and refrigerate 3-4 hours. To serve, top with  finely crushed ice and garnish with lemon. Serve immediately. Serves 6.
