Praline French Toast - Super Bfast- Radio
Margarine, Vanilla, French bread, Half and half, Pecans, Eggs, Pancake syrup; maple, brown sugar, 
Blend eggs, Half n Half, 1 T. brown sugar and the vanilla. Pour half of  the mixgture into 9x13" pan. Put the bread slices on top to cover the  bottom of pan. Spread rest of the mixture over the bread and cover and  refrigerate overnight to soak up well. In another 9x13" glass or  Corningware pan (either at the same time or the next morning) melt the  margarine, 3/4 c. of brown sugar, syrup and the nuts. Cover with foil if  overnight or use fresh if in the AM. Place the soaked bread on top of nut  muxture and bake at 350F. for 30-35 minutes until puffed and browned. Is  fantastic! You will only eat 2 pieces each. DON"T overcook or will  carmelize the bottom and be hard to get out of pan. Use glass or  Corningware as metal pans carmalize too quickly. Can brown slightly under  broiler if you want to, but not necessary.    Recipe by: WSGW  5/7/91   350F Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #769 by Ed  Griffin <egriff@bytethis.com> on Sep 01, 1997
