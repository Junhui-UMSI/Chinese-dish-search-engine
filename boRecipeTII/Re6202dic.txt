*Use a commercially canned brand which contains tomato puree.    **Or 1 tsp. fresh herb.    Heat oil in bottom of a medium, heavy saucepan.  Saute garlic and onions,  stirring just to soften.  Do not let color. Add remaining ingredients. Let  come to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently, uncovered, 10  minutes.  Remove bay leaf from sauce before using or freezing.    As pizza sauce, spread on prepared pizza crusts, English muffin halves or  pita bread halves and top with your favorite toppings and sprinkle with  grated cheddar, mozzarella or Parmesan cheese. Bake at 400 F. until  bubbling and cheese has melted, 10 to 15 minutes.    To use this as a tomato sauce for pasta, thin the sauce with stock or wine  to desired consistency. Leftover sauce freezes well.    Yield: About 2 1/2 cups.    From _Nancy Enrights Canadian Herb Cookbook_ by Nancy Enright. Toronto:  James Lorimer & Company, 1985.  Pg. 45. ISBN 0-88862-788-2.
