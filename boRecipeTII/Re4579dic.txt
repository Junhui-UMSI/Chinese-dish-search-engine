STEP ONE: Flour chicken breasts; set aside.

Be careful not to burn the garlic. Remove breasts from pan and set aside.    STEP TWO: Add honey, vinegar, and wine to pan; reduce mixture by half. Add  juices, salt, and pepper and reduce again by two-thirds. Discard garlic.    STEP THREE: Place parchment paper on a shallow roasting pan. Place breasts  on one-half of paper. Add pine nuts and spoon sauce over breasts. Fold  parchment paper over the top of the chicken. Crimp the edges together until  you have an air-tight seal. Place in a 450-degree oven for 12 minutes.  Remove promptly and serve, ensuring you distribute the sauce and pine nuts  equally.    CHEFS NOTE: Parchment paper is available at gourmet stores and some  hardware stores.
