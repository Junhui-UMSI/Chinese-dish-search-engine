Servings: 6 to 8    DIRECTIONS: Bring milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. In a large heavy  saucepan off the heat, beat egg yolks, granulated sugar and lemon zest  until pale and thick. Beat in flour until well blended. Very slowly pour in  hot milk, beating constantly. Cook custard cream over medium heat 5 to 8  minutes, beating constantly. Do not let boil. Custard cream is done when it  coats the back of a spoon. Moisten a large plate or cookie sheet with  water. Spread cooked cream to a thickness of 1/2 to 1 inch. Cream can be  prepared to this point a day or two ahead. When cream is completely cooled,  cut into squares or diamonds. Place breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Coat  cream shapes with breadcrumbs. Dip coated cream shapes into beaten eggs,  and coat again with breadcrumbs. Pour oil 2 inches deep in a large saucepan  or deep-fryer. Heat oil to 375-F (190-C) or until a 1-inch cube of bread  turns golden brown almost immediately. Using a slotted spoon, lower cream  pieces a few at a time into hot oil. Turn cream pieces. When golden on both  sides, remove from oil with slotted spoon. Drain on paper towels. Arrange  drained fried cream on a platter and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve  hot.
