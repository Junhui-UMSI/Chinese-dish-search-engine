In a kettle with a tight fitting lid, place the chicken, onion, lemon, bay  leaf, salt, pepper and water. Bring to rolling boil and skim away any froth  that gathers. Cover tightly and simmer for 30 minutes, or until a chicken  breast can be pierced with a fork. Turn pieces of chicken over once or  twice during this cooking period.    Dumplings: Mix well the flour, baking powder, salt, chopped onion and  nutmeg. Alternately add the beaten eggs and cream to the flour mixture,  stirring after each addition. Mix until all is smoothly blended. Drop  teaspoonsful of the mixture on top of the bubbling chicken mixture. Close  cover tightly again and simmer for another 15 minutes without opening  cover. When ready to serve, break dumplings apart with a fork, arrange on a  platter with the chicken, and pour the remaining gravy over all.
