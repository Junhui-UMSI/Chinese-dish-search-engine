1.  Prepare the sauce.  Mix cornstarch to thin paste with water, then stir  in shoyu and sugar.  Set aside.    2.  Heat wok until hot.  Add peppercorns and dry-fry over gentle heat for  1-2 mins.  Remove and crush in mortar and pestle.  Set aside.    3.  Add half of oil to wok and heat over moderate heat until hot.  Add beef  and peppercorns, increase heat to high and stir-fty for 3-4 mins until beef  is browned.  Remove wok from heat and tip beef and juices into bowl. Set  aside.    4.  Return wok to moderate heat.  Add remaining oil and heat until hot. Add  pepper, chiles, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for 2-3 mins until softened,  taking care not to let ingredients brown.    5.  Return beef and its juices to wok and stir to mix with vegetables. Stir  sauce to mix, then pour over been and vegetables.  Increase heat tio high  and toss until beef is hot and all ingredients ar combined.  Serve  immediatly.    My notes:  Delicious!  G made this, replacing szechuan peppercorns with  mixed peppercorns.  Try adding more vegetables (and increase sauce) to make  meat go further.  Serve over rice.
