Winter Squash and Fruit
Cider, Pear, Grated lemon and orange, Peel, Dried fruit, Banana, Cinnamon, Yam, (optional), Peeled winter squash, Apple, Nonstick cooking spray, Allspice, 
Cut vegetables and fruit into small pieces.  Mix with cider and spices.  Spray ovenproof container with nonstick cooking spray.  Put vegetables and  fruit into it and cover.  Bake in 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Remove  cover and add more cider if necessary.  You need enough liquid to keep it  from burning, but not too much.  Bake for at least 45 minutes more. The  longer you bake it, the more the flavors blend.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours  more at 325 degrees.    This comes out so sweet it could be either an accompaniment for a meal or a  dessert.    This is a slight modification of a recipe I found in a Blue Cross magazine.    Posted by Cindy Tobias <CLTOBIAS@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU> to the Fatfree Digest  [Volume 14 Issue 22] Jan. 22, 1995.
