Combine first 3 ingredients in a large bowl. Add hash brown potatoes &  cheddar shreds, stirring well. Pour into a 13 x 9 baking dish coated with  cooking spray. Top with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350F for 55-60  minutes or until potatoes are tender. Yield: 16 (1/2 cup ) side servings    Per serving: 132 cal, 3.1g fat (21%), 7 mg chol, 346 mg sod    Main dish variation: Add 1 (14 oz) package Healthy Choice sausage, cut into      1/2    inch pieces.    Changes: I used fatfree sour cream & 2% lowfat Kraft cheddar cheese since I  had those items on hand. I substituted garlic powder for the salt & used  regular parmesan cheese.
