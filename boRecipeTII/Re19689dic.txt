Clean the beef heart thoroughly, removing all nerves and fat. Cut into 1"  cubes, place in non-reactive bowl, refrigerate and set aside.    Combine garlic, chiles, cumin, oregan, salt and pepper and 1 1/2 cups  vinegar. Pour over meat. Add more vinegar, if necessary, to cover meat  completely. Marinate, refrigerated, 12-24 hours. About 1 hour before  grilling, remove meat from marinade and thread on skewers. Reserve  marinade.    Soak the crushed chile in 1/3 cup warm water for 30 minutes. In  processor, combine chiles and water with oil and salt. Add enough reserved  marinade (3/4 cup) to make thick sauce, puree.    Brush skewered meat with sauce and grill over hot coals or under a  broiler, turning and basting to cook quickly on all sides. Best cooked  medium well, 4-6 minutes on the grill. Serve with remaining sauce for  dipping.
