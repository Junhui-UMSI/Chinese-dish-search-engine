Tarka Dal
salt, coriander, garlic, turmeric, Water, Onion, Red lentils, ghee, Tomato, Garam masala, 
Check the lentils for stones and wash them in several changes of water or  until the water starts to run clear.    Put the lentils into a saucepan with the water and salt  and bring to the  boil.    Turn the heat down and simmer uncoverd for 20 minutes skimming off the  froth that collects at the top.  Now partly cover the pan.    Cook for a total of an hour stirring now and again.  At the end of the hour  you should have a pale yellow soup like mixture.    While the dal is cooking fry the onion and garlic in the ghee until the  onions are pale brown.  Be careful not to burn the garlic as this will add  a bad flavour to the dish.    Add the turmeric and garam masala to the onions and cook for a few more  seconds.    Stir the onion mixture into the cooked lentils.  Serve hot sprinkled with  chopped tomato and green coriander.    This dish can also be used as an ingredient in chicken Dhansak.  Make a  chicken curry using the basic sauce recipe I posted the other day but using  less of the curry sauce.  Also put a Tablespoon or two of lemon juice in  with the sauce when you are making the dish.  In case you are wondering what ghee is, it is clarified butter.  If you  cannot get it you can make it.  Here is how I do it.    Melt a pack of unsalted butter in a pan and then drain through a coffee  filter.  Discard all of the sludge that is left and leave the rest to cool.  You should be left with a clear golden liquid that sets hard. Ghee is used  in indian cooking because it has a much higher burn temperature than normal  butter.
