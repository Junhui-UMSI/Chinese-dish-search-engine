Preheat the oven to 425?. Lightly grease baking sheet and set aside. In a  small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Using a  pastry blender cut the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles  coarse cornmeal. In a small bowl, combine the egg and cream and add to the  flour mixture. Mix until just blended together. Turn out the batter onto a  lightly floured board and knead for 1 minute. Roll dough into a rectangle  approximately 4 x8?. Brush the dough with the melted butter. Sprinkle with  the sugar and orange zest. Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, and seal the long  seam by pinching it together lightly with your fingers. Cut the roll into  eight 1? thick slices. Lay slices down sideways on the prepared baking  sheet and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until scones are golden. Slice the  strawberries and place in a large pretty bowl with other whole berries, if  available. Sprinkle with sugar and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Whip the  heavey ream and stir in sugar to lightly sweeten. To serve, heap spoonfuls  of berries over each scone and top with freshly whipped cream.
