Copyright Washington Post    Like the preceding lasagne , this dish can be assembled the night before  and baked in the morning, baked and reheated the next day, or baked, frozen  and reheated. Choose the option that best fits your schedule.    Combine the ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup of the sugar, the vanilla and 1/4  teaspoon salt and mix well. Set aside. Place the cherries in a small  saucepan. Combine the cornstarch with 1/4 cup of the reserved cherry juice.  Discard the rest of the juice. Add the cherry juice mixture and the  cinnamon to the cherries. Bring to a boil over medium heat. The mixture  will thicken. Remove and set aside to cool.    Grease a lasagne pan. Place a layer of noodles on the bottom. Cover with  1/3 of the cheese filling, then scatter 1/3 of the cherry mixture over the  cheese. Cover with another layer of noodles and repeat once. Cover the top  layer with noodles and cheese, making sure to spread the cheese over all of  the noodle layer. Then spread the remaining cherry mixture on top, leaving  a 1-inch border around the dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight (if  desired). When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 35  to 45 minutes, until heated through. If reheating, bake at 350 degrees for       45    minutes.
