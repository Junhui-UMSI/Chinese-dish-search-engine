Raspberry-Peach Mousse Eclairs Pt 2
See part 1, 
stir in the chopped peaches.    4.In a chilled medium bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at medium  speed, beat the remaining 1/2 cup of cream until soft peaks begin to form.  Using a rubber spatula gently fold the whipped cream into the  white-chocolate raspberry mixture. Cover the surface of the mousse with  plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes, or until it has thickened to  the stage where it forms soft mounds. Do not let the mousse set completely.    Make the sauce:    1.In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen raspberries and sugar. Cook over  medium heat stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar is  completely dissolved and the berries are soft. Do not let the mixture boil.  Strain the raspberry mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Stir  in the Chambord; cover and refrigerate until serving.    Assemble the eclairs:    1.Slice eclairs in half; remove any moist dough. Fill each eclair with  about three tablespoons filling. Replace top of the eclair. Dust the  eclairs with confectioners sugar, if desired. To serve, drizzle some of  the raspberry sauce on each dessert plate. Top with eclair. Garnish with  peach slices and mint if desired.
