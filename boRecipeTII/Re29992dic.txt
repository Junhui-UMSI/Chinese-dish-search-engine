Source: From my mother with love & more. From Ruth Alon (a friend).    In a bowl put all the dry (filling) ingredients, Mix.Divide it to 3 equal  cups.    Butter or oil (I Oil) a 20/20 baking pan.    Cut 4x equal french leaf dough. On a floured board roll out a thin leaf to  measure the size of the pan. Put 1st layer in the pan, and skater on top  the first cup of nut mixture. Repeat the same with the rest of the dough  and nuts. you finish with the dough on top.    With a sharp knife cut only the top of the dough. Make a diagonals criss  cross 3 cm a part of each other.You will get parallelogram small cakes.    Bake in pre heated 375F hot oven 15 minutes, Reduce heat to 325F and  continue for another 40 - 45 minutes. If the first layer is getting brown  too soon, Cover it with a foil and continue to bake. It should bake well in  the inside too.    The Syrop: Boil the water with the sugar for 10 minutes. Add the honey with  the lemon. Cool a little.    When the pastry is ready. Cut deeply into the marked lines to the end of  the pastry. Pour the syrup over the Baklaueva, and serve cold.    It is not difficult to prepare.
