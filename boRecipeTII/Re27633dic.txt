Straight from the International Chili Societys newsletter, heres Scott  Robinsons recipe...the one that won him $25,000 and the Worlds Chili  Championship...    Makin It/Phase 1: Saute the meat in the vegetable oil, drain and add to a  4 quart pot.  Add all the rest of the ingredients in Phase 1 and simmer  covered 1 1/2 hours.    Makin It/Phase 2: Uncover, add the ingredients from Phase 2 and simmer  uncovered for 45 minutes.    Please notice that there are no beans involved in Scotts recipe. Per ICS  rules, the use of beans or any other filler in competition chili is  prohibited. But if ya gotta have em, add 3 or 4 cans of drained pintos  just at the end, in time to warm em up before serving. But try it without  the beans first so you can taste a $25,000 bowl of red!
