Two Fat Ladies? Scallops with Leeks
Dry vermouth, Heavy cream, Fresh sea scallops, Unsalted butter, Dry white wine, leeks, Shallots, Salt, Parsley; flat-leaf, 
This is from the Good Morning America recipes. Nadia    From Cooking with the Two Fat Ladies    I have used vermouth in this dish, which gives a good flavor. I love having  vermouth around for cooking, as I am not tempted to drink it.    1. Remove the scallops from their shells or ask your fishmonger to do this.  Separate the white flesh from the roe (if still there) and detatch the hard  skin around the whites and the tiny black sac from the roe. Wash clean  under a running tap. Halve the whites horizontally. Leave to dry off on  some paper towel.    2. Wash the leeks and discard the green parts (you can use them for soup or  stock). Slice the white stems lengthwise into narrow strips about 2 inches  long. Place in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of the butter, a pinch of salt  and 1/2 cup of water. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep hot.    3. In another pan, melt the rest of the butter and then gently cook the  shallots until they are soft. Add the wine, vermouth and the scallops, with  their roe if available. Bring just to boiling point, then turn the heat  very low and simmer for exactly 2 minutes, or less if the scallops are  small.    4. Remove the leeks from their liquid using a slotted spoon and place in a  heated dish. With the same implement place the scallops on top. Add the  leek juice to the scallop juice and boil briskly until the liquid is  reduced to 1/2 cup. Pour in the cream, bring back to a boil, and bubble for  a moment or two. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over the arranged  scallops and leeks. Scatter the minced parsley over all.  Posted to recipelu-digest by ncanty@juno.com (Nadia I Canty) on Feb 24,  1998
