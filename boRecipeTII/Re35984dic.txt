POLENTA:  In a heavy medium saucepan, bring 3 1/4 cups of water to a boil  over high heat.  With a large wire whisk, slowly whisk in the cornmeal in a  steady stream, whisking rapidly and constantly to prevent lumps. Reduce the  heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until  very thick, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in half of the  Parmesan cheese.  Coat two 9-inch square baking pans with nonstick cooking  spray. Spread the polenta evenly in the two pans. Place the pans in the  freezer for 20 minutes to chill.    Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and  garlic; saute for 1 minute.  Cover and let steam 10 minutes, stirring  occasionally.  Add the cooked ground beef, tomatoes, tomato paste, and  seasonings.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 15  minutes.    Preheat the oven to 450F.  When the polenta has chilled, spread half of the  meat sauce evenly over one layer in pan. Top with half of the mozzarella  and half the remaining Parmesan cheese. With your fingers, loosen the edges  of the polenta in the other pan. Invert the second pan over the first so  that the drops out into place..
