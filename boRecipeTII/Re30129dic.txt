submitted by: HANRE@aol.com (Hanadi, Kuwait)  Here are some of my favorite recipes. I hope youll enjoy them as much as  my family does.    Brown the meat without oil until it absorbs all its liquid.  Add the onions  then the spices and garlic. Mix well and add the tomatoes.  Let the stew  cook on med. heat w/ the lid on. Add the water when the tomatoes appear to  soften. Let it simmer for 15 min. then add the okra, paste and salt. Let  the stew cook slowly and towards the end add the strained tamarinds. Serve  hot w/ rice.
