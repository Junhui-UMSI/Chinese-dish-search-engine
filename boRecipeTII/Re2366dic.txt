Beef Wellington (Boeuf En Croute)
Puff Paste Dough, Duxelles, French Egg Wash, Sauce Perigueux, Beef Fillet, Brandy, Pate de Voilaille, Egg white, 
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Prepare a double portion of Pate  Feuilletee (Puff Paste Dough). Rub the beef with butter. USE A MEAT  THERMOMETER. Roast on a rack to an internal temperature of 120 degrees.  Remove the meat from the oven and flambe with the brandy. Let the meat cool  to room temperature. Coat the meat thinly with the Pate de Volaille. Roll  out part of the Pate Feuilletee (Puff Paste Dough) into a rectangle about 1  1/2" longer and 1 1/2" wider than the meat. Coat the dough with cooled  Duxelles. Center the fillet on the rolled out dough. Roll out the remaining  dough and shape it over the meat. Seal the top and bottom parts of the  dough together by pinching after brushing with egg white. Brush the exposed  surfaces of the dough with French Egg Wash. Place on a greased baking  sheet. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees. Bake  until the crust is golden (about 20 minutes). Let the preparation stand for  15 minutes before serving. Carve with a very sharp knife into 3/4" thick  slices. Serve with Sauce Perigueux.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 28, 98,
