Strawberry Divinity
Egg whites, Water, Sugar, Corn syrup, Strawberry jello, Coconut, Pecans, 
Combine sugar, syrup and water and bring to a boil, stiring constantly,  reduce heat to low and cook to hard ball stage (252 degrees). This can be  determined by dropping small amounts of mixture into cold cup of water. If  it becomes stiff and hard then it is ready.    Combine whites and Jello beat until mix forms a peak, pour hot syrup in  thin stream over egg whites and jello. Beat until loses its gloss and holds  its shape. Fold in coconut and nuts. Drop in teaspoons onto waxed paper.  Let set until they are hard.
