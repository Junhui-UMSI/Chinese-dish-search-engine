Add 2 whole buttons of garlic and  salt and pepper to taste. Bring the water to a boil and turn the heat down.  Cover the kettle with a lid and keep the water boiling until the tongue is  tender to fork. This can take three or more hours. When the tongue is  tender, run cold water over it and skin it. Be sure to trim the membranes  under the tongue. Next slice the tongue to about 1/4 inch slices. (The  tongue can be fixed a day or two ahead and then wrapped in saran wrap and  refrigerated.    Saute the garlic, onion and green pepper until golden brown. Add tomato  sauce, pimento and sugar. Simmer slowly for 15 minutes. Add the tongue and  continue simmering until the tongue is good and hot. This dish is good hot  or cold. The sauce can also be used for tripe, pigs feet or any left over  meat.
