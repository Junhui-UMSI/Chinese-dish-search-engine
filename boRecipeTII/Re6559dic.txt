1. For the ravigote sauce: Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a  small bowl, and set the mixture aside at room temperature.    2. When ready to cook the salmon, bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a  stainless steel saucepan. Place the salmon steaks in the pan, and bring the  water back to a boil over high heat (This will take about 2 minutes.)  Immediately turn off the heat, or slide the pan off the heat if using an  electric stove, and let the salmon steep in the hot liquid for 5 minutes.  (The steaks will be slightly underdone in the center at this point; adjust  the cooking time to accomodate thicker or thinner steaks and to satisfy  personal taste preferences.)    3. Remove the steaks from the liquid with a large spatula or skimmer, drain  them well, and place a steak on each of four warm plates. Sponge up any  liquid that collects around the steaks on the plates with paper towels, and  spoon the ravigote sauce over and around the steaks. Serve immediately.
