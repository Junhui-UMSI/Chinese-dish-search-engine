Pimentos
Pimentos -- See Below:, 
These are roasted peppers. Do this by setting halved peppers, skin side up  in a hot broiler till the skins are charred. Remove them and place them in  a paper bag and fold over top to seal. This will steam the peppers so that  the skin will slip off when they have cooled.  Once you have peeled the  peppers, rinse them off and slice or mince to the peppers however you want.  You will have to sterilize your canning jars by boiling them covered in  water for 10 minutes.  Place the slices or minced peppers in a drained jar  that is still hot and add sliced onions and/or peeled garlic cloves. Bring  wine vinegar that has been diluted with some water to a boil. ( Sorry, the  recipe is from an old Italian woman and it has no specifics here) Pour this  over the vegetables, push the peppers down with a wooden spoon to remove  the air bubbles. Seal the jar well. ( You may want to process these in a  water bath to ensure a good seal - I suggest about 10 minutes for jars that  hold a cup) cure for 4-6 weeks. Keep in the fridge or  a cool dark place.
