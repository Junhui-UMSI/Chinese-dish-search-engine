CRUST: Mix together well, either in a food processor or by cutting in by  hand.  Dont get the crust mixture too warm or it will be sticky and hard  to handle. Pat into a 9 x 13-inch pan. Bake for 15 minutes at 350 F.    FILLING: If using a food processor pour into work bowl and process until  well mixed.  Then add 3 cups pitted sour cherries and chop up by bursts of  the on/off switch. Dont chop too finely or the fruit will lose its  identity.   If using a mixer or by hand, mix the ingredients except fruit. Chop the  fruit and add to mixture.    Pour over the partially baked crust and bake for another 45 minutes.    Variations:  Rhubarb, apricots, peaches, plums, etc. are all equally  delightful.  If using berries, be careful to leave fruit intact.
