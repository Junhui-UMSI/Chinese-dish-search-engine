The next is from Simon Haxter, restaurant manager:    Combine mayonnaise, mustard, pepper and 1/2 tablespoon rosemary in bowl.  Generously coat chicken pieces with marinade.    Broil chicken breasts or saute them in oil over medium heat 5 to 8 minutes  or until cooked through.    While chicken is cooking, separately steam green beans and spinach, cooking  beans until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes, and cooking spinach just until  wilted. Set beans aside to cool. Keep spinach warm.    To make vinaigrette: Combine oil, vinegar, garlic, salt and reserved 2  tablespoons rosemary. Mix well. When beans are cool, add olives to them.  Pour desired amount of vinaigrette dressing over beans and olives.  (Remaining dressing can be refrigerated and used over a green salad.)    For each serving: Place bed of about 1/2 cup spinach on a plate. Set a  chicken breast atop spinach. Place 3/4 cup dressed beans on plate along  with 4 to 5 stuffed new potato halves. Garnish each chicken breast with  sprig of fresh rosemary. Makes 8 servings.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 633 by GramWag@aol.com on Jan  29, 1998
