Pecan Pavlovas
Vinegar, Nino (or finger) bananas,, FILLING AND GARNISH, Cream of tartar, Vanilla extract, Cornstarch, Salt, Egg whites, MERINGUE, Toasted pecans, chopped, Granulated sugar, French vanilla lowfat, 
Meringue: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400  degrees F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper; set aside. In a  4 1/2 quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using a wire whip  attachment, whip the egg whites, salt and cream of tartar until soft peaks  form. Spread the meringue mixture into a 9 inch circle, mounding the sides  a little higher than the middle. Place the cookie sheet into the oven and  immediately turn the oven temperature down to 250 degrees F. Bake the  meringue for 1 hour or until dry and crunchy on the outside. (Some cracks  may form on the surface.) Let cool to room temperature.    Assemble the Pavlova: Carefully peel the meringue off the parchment and  transfer to a serving plate. Create a 1 inch ring by spooning yogurt along  the entire inside edge of the meringue shell. Top the yogurt ring with  sliced bananas. Spoon yogurt into a 3 inch diameter mound in the center of  the shell. Top with bananas. Garnish center with strawberry salsa.
