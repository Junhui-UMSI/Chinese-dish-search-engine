Add chicken pieces, a few at a time to flour mixture. Close bag  and shake pieces to coat them.    Combine milk and egg in a small bowl. Put crushed crackers in another bowl.  Dip the flour coated pieces, 1/4 at a time, in the egg/milk mixture and  then roll them in the crackers. Place coated chicken pieces in a single  layer on a large ungreased baking sheet.
