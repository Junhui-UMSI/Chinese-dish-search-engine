Chocolate Walnut Torte
Unsalted margarine; for, Unbleached flour; for, Imported semisweet, Eggs, Sugar, Sugar; additional, Dark rum, Walnuts; finely ground, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease the sides and bottom of a 10 x 2-  1/2 inch springform pan. Dust with flour or potato starch, then invert the  pan and tap to shake out the excess.    Place the chocolate in the top of a double boiler, cover and set over  simmering water until melted. Let cool.    In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the egg yolks at medium speed for 5  minutes, gradually adding 1/2 cup of sugar. Beat in the chocolate and the  rum. Set aside.    In a clean dry bowl beat the egg whites at high speed until they are barely  foamy; gradually add the remaining sugar and beat until stiff. With a large  rubber spatula, fold 1/2 of the walnuts and and 1/4 of the whites into the  batter. Repeat with the remaining walnuts and another 1/4 of the whites.  Then reverse the process, pouring the batter over the whites. Gradually  fold the 2 batters together, making a motion like a figure eight, until all  the whites have disappeared.    Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 40  minutes, or until a cake tester or a toothpick inserted in the center of  the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Loosen the sides of the cake  with a knife and remove the rim of the pan.    To Serve: Loosen the bottom of the cake with a knife and invert the cake  onto a serving platter.    NOTE: "This is a large chocolatey, moist cake that is easy to make. It is  ideal for Passover or any large party. It stays fresh for several days  refrigerated, or you may freeze it."
