Sweet  N Sour Salad Dressing
Paprika, Catsup, Onion, Vegetable oil, Vinegar, Mustard, Salt, Sugar, Lemon juice, 
Put all ingredients in blender and mix. Store in refrigerator. I crumble  lots of blue cheese after the final blending for a really super dressing.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 17 Apr 97 by Nancy Bruce <NLB44@AOL.COM> on Apr 18,  1997
