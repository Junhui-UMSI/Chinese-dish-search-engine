There  will be approximately 50 woman, many of whom are over the age of 80. The  woman who used to make the tea, used a pre-sweetened package, orange juice  concentrate and lots of fresh mint.  People still expect this tea, however,  the woman has Alzheimers and no one is able to duplicate the taste. Does  anyone have the measurements for this?  How about a totally different ice  tea recipe or something similar?  I actually thought about making lemonade  from scratch, and still havent abandoned the idea. The main course will be  a cold chicken dish.  Any suggestions?
