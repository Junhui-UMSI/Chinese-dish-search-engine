Authentic Recipe for Baba-Ghannouj
Purple eggplant, A few drops of liquid smoke, Limes or lemons; juice of, Tehina; up to 1/3, Salt, Garlic, 
For garnish: whole parsley leaves with 1/4" of stem left on and sweet  paprika (hot paprika or cayenne may be substituted).    Roast eggplant over an open hardwood fire (in that case omit smoke extract)  or on BBQ until skin is thoroughly charred and eggplant is totally soft  (test with skewer). OR Roast eggplant in 500 degrees oven until totally  soft through and through (test with skewer). Place roasted eggplant in a  basin of cold water and remove every bit of skin. Put eggplant in colander  to drain water away. In mortar, pound garlic with salt until reduced to a  smooth paste. Place garlic-salt paste in food processor and add lime or  lemon juice (I prefer lime), tehina and smoke extract if used. Process on  continuous. If dressing coagulates (citric acid will do that to tehina),  add JUST ENOUGH water, in a thin stream, until dressing reliquefies to a  thick yet pourable texture (like heavy pancake batter). Place eggplant in  shallow serving bowl. With 2 forks, shred the meat thoroughly. Do not  process the eggplant in the food processor, as that completely ruins the  texture, which should be somewhat stringy (but very very soft!). Blend in  the dressing uniformly. Smooth surface of baba-ghannooj and decorate by  sticking the parsley stem down in the b-g in a regular pattern. Sprinkle a  little paprika between the "florets". You may also drizzle a little bit of  extra-virgin olive oil in tiny pools here and there on the surface. Serve  with warm Arabic bread, tomato wedges, spring onions, oil- or brine-cured  olives (green or black) and cucumber pickles (NOT the sweet kind. Kosher  dills work well).
