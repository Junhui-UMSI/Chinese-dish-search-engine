Queso Flameado
Gold tequila, Panela cheese, olive oil, Flour, Lime juice,; to taste, 
Slice the cheese 1/2inch thick and place in a bowl of ice water for about 5  minutes. Pat the cheese dry and dust with the flour, shaking off any  excess.    Heat a large cast iron skillet, over a high heat. Add the oil and fry the  cheese, turning once, until golden brown. USE CAUTION: Standing far enough  back so you do not get near the flames, ignite the tequila. Let the flames  die out.    Remove the cheese and tequila to a platter and finish with a sprinkling of  lime juice. Serve with pickled chipotle peppers and warm corn tortillas.
