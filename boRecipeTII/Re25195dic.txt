Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    Slice the tops off the tomatoes and scoop out the seeds and pulp. Sprinkle  the insides with salt and invert the tomatoes on paper towels to drain.    In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Add the shallots and garlic and saute  until soft but not brown. Add the flour and continue cooking for 2 to 3  minutes, stirring continuously. Whisk in the half-and-half and the sherry,  cooking for 3 minutes longer and continuously whisking until the mixture is  smooth. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let cool slightly. Whisk in the  goat cheese, egg yolks, chives, savory, salt and pepper.    In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold stiff peaks. Stir  1/4 of the whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it. Carefully fold in  the remaining whites.    Spoon the souffle mixture into the tomato shells, mounding it slightly.  Place the tomatoes, with their sides touching, in a lightly oiled baking  dish. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops are lightly puffed and  browned.    Serve the hot tomatoes immediately on a bed of the mixed greens on chilled  plates. Drizzle on about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette and finish with a  sprinkling or two of white pepper and basil oil.
