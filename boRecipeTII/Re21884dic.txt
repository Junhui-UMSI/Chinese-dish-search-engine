In a  bowl, cover with I cup boiling water and leave to soak for at least 2 hours  or overnight. Strain the liquid through a medium-mesh sieve into a large  saucepan, pressing down hard on the solids. Discard the solids. Stir in the  honey, ginger, and salt. Add the apples and place the pan over medium-high  heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered for about  40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened into applesauce.
