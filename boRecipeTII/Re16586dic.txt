Aiken County Corn Bread Dressing
Salt, Onion, Eggs, Baking Powder, White corn meal, Shortening, milk, Flour, 
Pepper to taste    Make a batter of the cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, shortening (the  oil from the baking fowl is generally used) and milk. Bake in a hot oven  (400) until done, about half an hour. Then crumble the bread, add one  medium sized onion, chopped fine, pepper and a little more salt. Break in  the two eggs and wet with the juice from the baking chicken or turkey. The  liver chopped fine and added to the dressing improves it, as does the  addition of hard cooked egg. After mixing thoroughly, put the mixture on  one side of the baking dish and roast with the fowl until brown. When  basting the fowl, baste the dressing also to keep it moist and to improve  the flavor. This amount will serve 12 persons.
