The day before, soak the black fungi in boiling water. (It will become soft  as it expands.) Rub gently with your fingers to remove dirt. Drain and add  fresh boiling water. Repeat this four times, or until dirt seems to be  cleaned away. Add more boiling water and allow to soak for 6 to 10 hours.  Blot dry before cooking. Mix the cornstarch and egg white in a bowl. Add  the shrimp, pork, and scallops. Toss lightly until each piece is coated. In  another bowl, combine the black fungi, garlic, spring onion, salt, chicken  stock, and malt vinegar. Heat the soya bean oil to 325 F. Drop the lightly  coated shrimp, pork, and scallops into the wok and stir-fry for one minute.  Remove and drain. Remove all but one tablespoon of cooking oil from the  wok. Add black fungi mixture to wok. Bring to a boil. When mixture has come  to a boil, drop in drained shrimp, pork, and scallops and stir-fry for 30  seconds. Pour onto a serving dish. Add sesame oil and serve.    MR.
