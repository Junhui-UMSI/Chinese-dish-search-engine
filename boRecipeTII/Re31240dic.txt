Banana-Peanut Butter Bread

Here is a terrific loaf of bread that tastes good throughout the entire  meal-- including the dessert course, which it might well replace. It  combines two flavors that go well together: peanut butter and bananas.    1. Slice bananas into a blender. Puree until smooth.    2. Beat peanut butter and butter together until smooth. Beat in eggs, then  bananas until well blended.    3. Combine all dry ingredients, then add to banana mixture, beating in a  little at a time, until completely blended.    4. Pour batter into nine-by-five-inch loaf pan. Bake in preheated 350  degree F. oven 50 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted into loaf comes  out clean.    5. Cool 10 minutes in pan, then turn onto wire rack to complete cooling.  Makes one loaf.    Posted to recipelu-digest by "Joe" <Broutek@worldnet.att.net> on Mar 2,  1998
