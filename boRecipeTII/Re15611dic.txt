Mix all base ingredients thoroughly.  Roll out to about 1/8" thickness.    Roll out puff pastry to 1/4" thickness.    Saute the beef.  Dissolve the stock cube in the water, add to beef. Season  to taste.  Sprinkle with flour and cook till flour is browned and  incorporated well. Adjust seasoning and coloring to taste.    Make pies by putting scoops of about 1/4 cup on the base crust. Egg glaze  around the filling and top with the puff pastry, using the egg glaze as a  "glue" (try not to leave large air pockets).
