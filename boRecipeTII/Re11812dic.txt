1. To make the filling, saute the onion and garlic in olive oil until soft.  Add the spinach and cook until the leaves have wilted. Remove from heat and  cool.    2. Combine the ricotta cheese, Parmesan, pinenuts, salt, and pepper.    3. To make the pasta, fill the pasta sheets with even rows made by placing  a generous tablespoon of the filling on the pasta.    4. Seal by crimping and cut into rectangles approximately 2-1/2 x 3 inches  or to desired size. Allow 4 ravioli per person.    5. Drop the ravioli into salted, boiling water for 2-3 minutes depending on  thickness of dough. Drain in colander.    6. To prepare the sauce, bring the cream and garlic to a boil. Reduce the  heat to a moderate flame and continue boiling until the cream is reduced by  half.    7. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and the fresh herbs and taste for salt and  pepper.    8. Add the cheese and ravioli last.    NOTE: Fresh pasta sheets are available at any good specialty store. You may  want to spray the pasta with water, sparingly, to facilitate crimping to  seal the ravioli. You may not need all the sauce, but it is nice to have a  little extra just in case a guest prefers his pasta with more sauce.
