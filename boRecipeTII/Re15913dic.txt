Acqua Di Miele Alla Luganese (Honey Water)
Cinnamon, Wine, red, dry, Honey, 
Combine the wine and honey in a bowl and mix well. Add the cinnamon  stick. Cover and let stand in the sun for 3 days. Stir occasionally. Remove  the cinnamon. Pour into bottles or glass jars and seal. Let stand 3 more  days in the sun. This used to be given to children and anybody else who  needed a strengthening drink - for a cold, or before going swimming in Lake  Lugano.
