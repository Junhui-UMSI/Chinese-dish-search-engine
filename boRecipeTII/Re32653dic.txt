Sweet Petals
Pecans, Recipe basic sweet dough;, Cinnamon, Butter, Sugar, Brown Sugar, 
Place a 15-inch sheet of foil on cookie sheet; grease and turn up edges to  form 12-inch round pan. Combine sugars, cinnamon and nuts. Pinch off small  piece of dough, enough to roll into a 6-inch strip 1/2 inch thick. Dip in  melted butter, then in sugar mixture. Wind into a flat coil in center of  pan. Continue making strips, winding and placing coils close together to  form a round flat coffee cake. Sprinkle with remaining sugar mixture.  Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at      350    degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Cool slightly.  Drizzle with Vanilla Glaze (posted).    TIP: Dough may be coiled in two 8-inch round pans. Bake as directed above.    YIELD: 1 COFFEE CAKE    Notes: This cookbook was acquired at a junk sale. It captured my interest  because of the annotated comments beside the recipes. The original owner  had made comments or just check marks beside certain recipes. I will  include these as I scan. This one had no markings.
