OR: thick yogurt as a Pessach or low(er) fat option instead of white sauce  Halve chatzilim, salt and leave to stand for 15-20 mins. Rinse, prick skin  and bake cut side down in a 180C (350F) oven till soft (approximately 25  mins).    Heat the oil/marge for frying. Chop the onions and mushrooms into biggish  pieces. Fry onions till just transparent. Add mushrooms and fry till they  are soft.    Make the white sauce: Melt marge/butter, add the flour and nutmeg and whisk  for 1/2 a minute. Gradually add the milk stirring all the while until you  have a thickish sauce: not runny but not thick enough that a wooden spoon  can stand upright in the sauce. Add a few Tablespoons of the grated cheese.    Scoop out the insides of the baked chatzilim and chop into small pieces.  (Make sure the skins stay whole for stuffing.) Mix with the onions and  mushrooms. Add the white sauce or yogurt. Mix well. Stand the skins side by  side in a baking dish and spoon the mixture into each one. Sprinkle with  grated cheese and top with a light sprinkling of paprika.    Bake in a 180C (350F) oven till cheese is lightly browned on top.    Enjoy! It may sound a little patchky (lots of little bits and pieces to do)  but isnt too difficult if you co-ordinate things and it really is a  delicious meal.
