Stuffed Chili Rellenos
Monterey Jack cheese; grated, Eggs, Whole Ortega chilies, Very sharp cheddar cheese, Milk; please use whole milk, GUY ATTWOOD, Bisquick; heaping, Flour; for dusting cheeses, Crab;and/or cooked and diced, 
Drain the chilies. Plan about 4 per person. Open each chili flat. In the  bottom of a well buttered glass oven dish; place a layer of chilies. Dust  the jack cheese with a small amount of flour. Mix together the crab and/or  shrimp with the Jack cheese. Place a thin layer of this mix over the bottom  layer of chilies.   Place another layer of chilies on top and repeat process ending with a top  layer of chilies.     Cook in a 375*F oven for 7-10 minutes; uncovered.   Remove from oven and reduce heat to 300*F. Mix together the batter--you  may have to double the batter to be sure you cover the dish well--and pour  over the chilies. Add the cheddar cheese and cook, COVERED, slowly in a  300*F oven until done. You will know it is done when a knife inserted in  the middle comes out relatively clean. If the center does not set up  completely after about 30 minutes, dont worry just serve it up with a  salad and, I like corn with it.
