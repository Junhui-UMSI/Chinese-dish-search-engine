Chilies and citrus fruits combine in a powerful combination of vitamin C  and flavor. This salad complements fish and poultry especially well.  Jicama, a crunchy, mild flavored tuber, is available at Latin markets and  in many supermarkets.    Cut fruit sections away from their surrounding membranes into a bowl. Add  jicama, chilies, oil, vinegar, lime juice, parsley and sugar and toss to  coat. Let salad stand at room temperature for 1 hour. (The salad can be  made ahead to this point and refrigerated overnight.)    Just before serving, sprinkle the salad with walnuts.    144 CALORIES PER SERVING: 3 G PROTEIN, 4 G FAT, 29 G CARBO- HYDRATE; 5 MG  SODIUM; 0 MG CHOLESTEROL.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg
