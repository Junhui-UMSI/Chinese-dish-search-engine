Prepare the crust. Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut into  the lard with two knives or a pastry cutter. The mixture should be smooth  and crumbly. Slowly work in the ice water and knead the dough until smooth.  Roll the dough into a bowl and dust with flour. Cover it with plastic wrap  and refrigerate for 1 hour. Roll out half the dough and use it to line a 9  in. pie pan. Brush the inside of this crust with beaten egg. Prepare the  filling. Combine the apples with the spices. Pour the apples into the crust  and top with the butter and sugar. Roll out the remaining dough and place  it on top of the pie. Prick the top crust with a fork and brush it with the  remaining beaten egg. Bake the pie in a preheated oven for 1 hour, or until  well browned.
