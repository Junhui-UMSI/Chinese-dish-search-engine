A Bowl of Red (Reno Red)
-cold water, Paprika, Chilis ( or more), Onion, finely chopped, Cumin, TVP (12oz), olive oil, Cayenne pepper, Garlic; minced, -water, 
Wash, stem and remove the seeds from the chilies.  Put the chilies in 3  cups cold water and bring to a boil. After about 45 minutes to an hour, the  skins should slop easily. Mash the pulp to a paste. If this seems too  difficult, you can substitute chili powder at a ratio of 1 teaspoon of  chili powder to 1 pod of chili. Read the instructions on the so or TVP  package to see if the product was soaked before hand. If not, use some of  the water to prepare this ingredient.  Saute the onions in olive oil until  translucent.  Add the garlic and spices the 12 cups of water. Bring to a  boil, then add the TVP nuggets.  Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30 minutes to  an hour.  If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa, the cornmeal  flour used in tortillas. When made in bulk this chili can easily be frozen.  total calories per serving: 163 fat:4g (22%)    Source: Vegetarian Journal Jan/Feb 95 formatted 2/17/95  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #295 by "Robert Ellis"  <rpearson@snowcrest.net> on Nov 5, 1997
