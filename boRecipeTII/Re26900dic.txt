Baked Blueberry French Bread
Italian bread, Milk, 2% lowfat, Cinnamon, Blueberries, frozen or fresh, Eggs, Vanilla, Sugar, Powdered sugar, Baking Powder, Cornstarch, Butter, 
Slice the bread on the diagonal to create 8 3/4-inch thick pieces, heels  removed. Arrange the bread slices in a 10-by-15 inch baking dish.    In a medium bowl, whip together the eggs, milk, baking powder and vanilla.  Slowly pour the mixture over the bread, turning each slice to coat  completely. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1  hour, but preferably overnight.    Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Coat another 10-by-15 inch baking dish  with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle the blueberries over the bottom of  the pan. Mix together the sugar, cinnamon and cornstarch and pour even over  top of the berries. Tightly wedge the bread slices over the blueberries,  wettest side up. Brush the bread with melted butter. Bake the French toast  in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.    To serve, place the toast -- berry-side down -- on warmed plates. Stir the  remaining berry mixture in the baking dish, then scoop over the toast.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.    Note: This has lots of blueberries in it.When fresh berries are very sweet,  reduce amount of sugar. Begin this recipe a few hours ahead of serving  time.    >From "Vive La French Toast!" by Gail Greco    Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com>; mc post 7/9/97    Recipe by: Seven Sisters Inn, Ocala, Florida Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1  #663 by Badams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com> on Jul 09, 1997
