Source: Ruth Heiges & Donna Steinhorn    Prepare Jello per package directions. Refrigerate.    When partially set, mix in the marshmallows. Refrigerate in clear glass  bowl.    When completely set, prepare pistachio pudding mix per package directions.  Layer over the Jello.    Refrigerate until well chilled.    Top with Cool Whip.    Sprinkle with tinted green sugar, green M&Ms and green jelly beans**    **Note: leave off the green jelly beans, and instead use those jellied  candies that have the sugar on them...the half moon shaped thingies. Those  could be carefully placed in the bowl to create a shamrock design.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Sharon Stein"  <Sharon.Stein@mcmail.vanderbilt.edu> on Apr 02, 1998
