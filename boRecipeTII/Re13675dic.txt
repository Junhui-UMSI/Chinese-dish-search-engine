Wild Rice and Acorn Squash
Grated Parmesan cheese, Green bell pepper, Black Pepper, Firm apple, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic, Onions, Acorn squash, Wild rice, celery, Corn kernels, Red bell pepper, fresh herbs, 
HERBAL CHOICES: thyme, basil, oregano, parsley, chives. Preheat oven to  350F. Cut a 1/4-inch slice off ends of squash halves to prevent wobbling.  Remove seeds. Bake, open side down, on a lightly sprayed baking sheet until  soft (40 min.). Cool.    Rinse rice. Place in a medium pot with water to cover by 4 inches. Bring to  a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until tender (1 hour). Add water  as needed to keep rice from drying. Drain well.    Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet. Add onions, celery, garlic and  peppers and cook over medium heat until browned (5 min.). Stir in apple and  corn and cook until apple loses rawness (3 minutes). Add rice and herbs and  cook for 1 min. Stir in cheese and ground pepper to taste.    Spoon rice mixture into a shallow baking dish and nestle squash halves into  it, filling each with some rice mixture. Bake at 400F for 10 to       15    minutes. Serves 4.
