Wassail #2
Apple cider, Sticks cinnamon, Cloves, Lemon; washed and sliced, White wine, Orange; washed and sliced, Rum, Allspice, 
Simmer the nonalcoholic ingredients together for 1-2 hours, then add the  wine and rum about 10 minutes before serving (hot).     I tested this recipe by dividing all the above quantities by 5, to  approximately scale to a 750ml bottle of white wine.  The scaled-down  recipe I used fit well in my crock pot.
