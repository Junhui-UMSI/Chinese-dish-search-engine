1. Prepare a medium-hot barbecue fire in a covered grill or preheat a gas  grill.    2. In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to gently but thoroughly combine  the meat, onion, bread crumbs, parsley, Worcestershire sauce, milk,  mustard, salt, pepper, nutmeg, cloves and egg. Form the mixture into 6 oval  loaves, each about 3/4-inch thick.    3. Grill the meatloaves, turning two or three times and brushing with the  sauce halfway through the cooking, until the loaves are well browned and  crisp on the outside and the meat is no longer pink in the center, about 15  minutes.    Leftovers For barbecued meatloaf sandwiches, cut the loaves into chunks,  then simmer for about 10 minutes in barbecue sauce thinned with a little  beer or ginger ale. Serve on soft hamburger buns or white bread.
