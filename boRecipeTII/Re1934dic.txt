Chocolate Balls
Water, Sugar, Ground walnuts, Ground almonds, Ground coconut, Unsweetened Chocolate, Honey, Or 3 T. kirsch, Cocoa powder to roll balls, 
Over low heat, dissolve sugar in water. Add chocolate to melt. Add all  other ingredients except kirsch and cocoa. Stir continuously over low heat  until mixture becomes a paste. Remove from heat; add kirsch. Let cool  completely. Form into small balls and roll in cocoa. Serve in small paper  cases.    The last time I made them, I didnt have a scale so I just measured out  equal amounts of everything (and half that measure of water). I guessed  with the kirsch -- the measurement is imprecise anyway. And they were  delicious.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Paula Miller Jacobson" <paulaj@erols.com>  on Sep 7, 1998,
