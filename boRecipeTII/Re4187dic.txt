Perfect Apple Pie - Sugar Free
Nutrasweet Spoonful, Tart apples, Ground cinnamon, Ground nutmeg, Pastry, All-purpose flour, Margarine, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. If apples lack tartness, sprinkle with about 1  tablespoon lemon juice. Combine sugar, flour, spices, and dash salt; mix  with apples. Line 9-inch pie plate with pastry. Fill with apple mixture;  dot with margarine. Adjust top crust, cutting slits for escape of steam;  seal. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 400F for 50 minutes or till done.  (Personal Notes: I sometimes use "canned in water" apple slices and they  work just fine.)
