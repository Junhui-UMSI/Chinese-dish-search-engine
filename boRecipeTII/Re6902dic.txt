Pomodori Secchi Imbottoti ("Sun-Dried Tomato
Garlic, finely minced, Red pepper flakes, Sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil, Oregano, salt and pepper, 
Ensure that the tomatoes are not overly salty. Refresh them in warm water  to cover for about 10 minutes. Soak them just long enough to soften them,  but be careful that they do not become soggy.  Drain & pat dry. Warm the  olive oil in a small saute pan over very low heat. Add the garlic, red  pepper flakes & oregano & warm for 5 to 8 minutes. Be careful not to let  the garlic burn.  Season with salt & pepper to taste. Make the "sandwiches"  by laying one tomato face down, drizzling a bit of the herb-infused olive  oil on it & covering with a second sun-dried tomato. Serve at room  temperature.
