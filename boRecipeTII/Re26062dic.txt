Tofu Meatloaf
Onion, Oregano, Olive Oil, Vegetarian Hamburger, Egg, Salt, Garlic, Half Green Pepper, mushrooms, Mozzarella Cheese, Pepper, Italian Tomato Paste  , Parmesan cheese, Bread crumbs, 
Saute the chopped onion, garlic and olive oil in a saute skillet (at least  8"), until glassy. Add the Green pepper, mushroom and HALF the Newmans  Dressing, reduce heat and continue to saute until peppers are cooked (no  longer crunchy).  Add seasoning to personal preference. Preheat oven to  425*. Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs (I usually just  take stale bread and tear it up into small pieces), one can of the tomato  paste, cheeses and Tofu. Beat the egg separately, and add to Tofu-Bread  mixture. Combine until bread is thoroughly saturated. Add sauteed  vegetables and remaining Newmans Dressing. The Meatloaf mixture should be  cohesive enough to form into a loaf, but not soggy. If the mixture is too  soggy, add more bread.  If the mixture is too crumbly, add more dressing,  or tomato paste. Tofu has a tendency to separate, so the more bread and  cheeses, the better. Spray a loaf pan with a non-stick cooking spray, and  spoon tofu mixture into pan, spreading to an even level. Spoon remaining  can of Tomato paste over tofu mixture, and spread evenly over the top. Bake  in 425 * oven 15-25 minutes, or until juices bubble up around the edges.
