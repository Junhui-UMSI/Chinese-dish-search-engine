(You may need to do this in batches unless you have a large  food processor.)    In a large bowl, combine the pureed chili mixture, the shortening, the  salt, the baking powder, and the cornmeal. Mix dough until smooth. (The  recipe says to use an electric mixer, but I found it easier to just use a  spoon.)    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #280    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
