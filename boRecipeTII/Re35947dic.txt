Stuffed Peaches
Lemon juice, Peaches, Vanilla extract, Honey, Lemon Rind, Ground cinnamon, Low-Fat Yogurt, Chopped Raisins, 
Scald peaches in boiling water for 1 minute to loosen skins. Drain, peel,  cut in half and discard the pits. Brush the fruit with lemon juice to  prevent discoloration. With a grapefruit spoon or melon scoop, remove about  half of the pulp from each peach, leaving a sturdy shell. Brush the insides  of the shells with more lemon juice. Chop the pulp. In small bowl, combine  the raisins, honey, vanilla, lemon rind and cinnamon. Add the peach pulp.  Fold in just enough yogurt to bind the stuffing together. Divide the  stuffing among the peach halves. Serve immediately. From: "The Healing  Foods Cookbook" by Rodale Press Posted by: Grandma Sheila Exner - August  1991
