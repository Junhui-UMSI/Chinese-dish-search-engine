Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets
Water, Nestle Butterscotch Morsels, Egg whites, golden pound cake mix, Butter, Powdered sugar, CAKE, FROSTING, 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Beat the egg whites until thick.  Blend the egg whites with the cake mix and water. Pour the batter  into a greased 9x12-inch baking pan. Bake for 30 minutes, or until  the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes  out clean. Cool. For the frosting, melt the butterscotch morsels in a  microwave oven on high for 45 seconds. If you dont have a microwave  oven, use a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water. Mix the  butter with the melted butterscotch. Add the powdered sugar.  Blend  with a mixer until the frosting has a smooth consistency. Spread the  frosting on top of the cooled pound cake. Cut the cake into nine  rows. Then make two cuts lengthwise. This should divide cake into  twenty-seven equal pieces.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
