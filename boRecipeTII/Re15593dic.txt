From the Arcata Co-op Bakery    THis bread will not only nourish you, it will surprise you with its unique  and delightful flavor and texture. Definetly worth the extra effort of  finding the 9-grain mix ingredients. The mix will keep well in the  refrigerator - were sure youll want to make this bread again (try a  handful in pancakes!).    Mix the water, molasses, malt and yeast.  Add the 9 grain mix, flour, salt  and oil (you can also make a sponge and wait, but its not necessary). Mix,  and knead dough well. Let rise, shape into loaves and let rise again in  oiled bread pans.  Bake at 350 F for 45 min.    From: "Uprisings: Whole Grain Bakers Book" Posted by Theresa Merkling.
