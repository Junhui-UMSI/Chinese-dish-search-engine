Thai Ice Cream
Coconut milk, Vanilla, mint, Salt, Water, Coconut, Eggs, 
Stir fry the coconut until golden (optionally use a few pieces of fresh  corn... Thais often flavor ice cream with things considered unusual to  western tastes).     Heat the coconut milk and water over medium heat, stirring continuously  for a couple of minutes. DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL.     In a bowl beat two eggs, plus two yolks, then add the other ingredients,  and whisk gently.     Transfer the mixture to a double boiler over gently boiling water, and  slowly blend in the hot coconut milk, stirring until the mixture thickens  to form a continuous slightly sticky coat on the back of a spoon lifted  from the mixture.     Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then transfer to a metal ice  cream tray or similar container and place in the coldest part of the  freezer for one hour.     Remove to a food processor and beat slowly until smooth (this  incorporates some sir into the mixture and prevents it becoming too hard),  then return to the freezer and complete the freezing process.
