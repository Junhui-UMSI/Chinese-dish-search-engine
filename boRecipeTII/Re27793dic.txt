The Sizzlers Garlic-Cheese Toast
Butter, Oil, Bread, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Cooks memo: If these directions are followed the results will be an exact  duplicate of the garlic bread served at The Sizzlers res- taurants.    Buy a 2-pound loaf of commercial egg bread labeled Texas Toast or Pullman  Egg Bread. (This bread can be bought in US at a Wonder-Hostess Bakery  Outlet.) Butter both sides of the bread slices. Press buttered slices into  grated Parmesan cheese (such as Kraft dried parmesan). Cover the slices  well with the grated cheese. Toast on a well-oiled flat griddle or skillet  over medium heat, turning once. Any extra bread freezes well.    Posted by PAT-hanneman, Riverside, CA 6/27/97    Recipe by: E.
