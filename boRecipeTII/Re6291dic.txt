Plain Old-Fashioned Rice Pudding
Salt, Uncooked rice (not instant,, Sugar, Butter, Cinnamon and/or nutmeg, Vanilla extract, milk, Raisins or currants, 
Adjust rack to center of oven. Preheat oven to 300 F. In a 5- to 6-cup  ovenproof casserole, preferably shallow, mix milk, sugar, salt, butter, and  the rice which must be measured carefully. (Just a bit too much will make  the pudding heavy.) Bake uncovered for 2 hours, stirring occasionally - at  least three or four times, or more, if you wish. Add vanilla and raisins or  currants. Stir well. Sprinkle a bit of cinnamon and/or nutmeg over the top.  Bake 1 hour longer without stirring, in order to let a "skin" form on top.  Remove from oven. The pudding will sink slightly. Cut around the edge so  that the "skin" will sink down with the pudding. Serve while slightly warm,  at room temperature, or chilled. Spoon into dessert bowls and pass a  pitcher of very cold heavy cream.    Recipe is from _Maida Heatters Book of Great Desserts_.
