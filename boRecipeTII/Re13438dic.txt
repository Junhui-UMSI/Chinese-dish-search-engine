*Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION:       Mix sliced pork  and chicken with meat marinade for 1/2 hour. COOKING: Bring chicken broth  to a boil. Add pork, chicken, bok choy and cook for 1 minute. Add shrimp  and fried wontons, cook until wontons are           heated through. Add  abalone and green onion last and       heat for 1/2 minute more. Serve. DO  AHEAD NOTES: Do        through preparation. COMMENTS: This is a slightly  different version of the more familiar wonton soup. Here, the wontons are  deep fried first then put into       the broth, which makes the wonton  wrappers produce a       most interesting texture and flavor. Of course, if  you     want to make wonton soup, just drop the wrapped wontons into the  broth. But you owe it to your curiosity to give this recipe a try. Source:  "Dim Sum"     by Rhoda Fong Yee.
