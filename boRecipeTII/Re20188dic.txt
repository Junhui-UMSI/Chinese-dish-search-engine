It is good plain or with whipped  cream. A standing electric mixer is needed for this recipe.    Preheat the oven to 350~. Generously grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt pan or  tube pan. Tap out any excess flour. Sift the cake flour, granulated sugar,  baking powder, and salt into the bowl of a standing electric mixer. In a  medium bowl, using a fork, beat together the sour cream, milk, whole eggs,  egg yolks, and vanilla until very well blended and smooth. Add the butter  and half the egg mixture to the dry ingredients. Beat at low speed just  until thoroughly incorporated. Increase the speed to high and beat for 1  minute; do not overmix. Add the remaining egg mixture and beat at  medium-high speed until the batter is fluffy and smooth, about 1 minute  longer. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Rap the pan on the counter  several times to remove air bubbles. Bake the cake in the middle of the  oven for 50-60 minutes, or until it is well browned, pulls away from the  pan sides, and a toothpick inserted in the thickest part comes out clean.  Run a thin knife around the pan edges to loosen the cake, then invert onto  a serving plate.    Using a small strainer, sift a little confectioners sugar over the cake,  if desired. (The cake will keep for up to 5 days covered at room  temperature or for up to 2 weeks wrapped airtight and frozen.)
