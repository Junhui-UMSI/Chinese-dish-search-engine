Potato Pancakes or Latkes
Russet potatoes, Flour, Salt and pepper to taste, Onion, Vegetable oil, Salt, Eggs, 
Peel and grate the potatoes into a large bowl.  Fill the large bowl with  cold water.  Let the potatoes soak for 10-15 minutes, swishing them  occasionally.  Drain. Refill with cold, salted water (not too much, and you  dont need the salt if you are sodium-restricted). Soak for another 5-10  minutes.  Drain in a colander. Drain a long time. Press them out, wait, and  press more. Toss them around. Press some more (you get the picture).    Put the potatoes in the bowl with the diced onion, the eggs and the flour,  mix together, and salt & pepper to taste.    Heat about 1/4" of oil in a large skillet or electric frying pan to around  350F.  Spoon about 1/2 c. of the potato mixture into the hot oil, spreading  it out with the back of a pancake turner. Cook until brown on the bottom  (3-4 minutes?); turn and cook until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.    Enjoy!    Gary -- Gary L Hewitt glhewitt@phoenix.princeton.edu
