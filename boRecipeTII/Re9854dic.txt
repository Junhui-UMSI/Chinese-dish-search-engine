Trim root end of leek and tough parts of green tops, and discard; use  only very tender green section. Slice leek crosswise into 1-inch pieces;  pull layers apart and rinse away grit. Rinse poblano and ancho chilies;  remove and discard stems. Cut both chilies open; rinse out seeds. Chop  separately.    2. To a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, add oil. When hot, add leek and  poblano chili. Saute vegetables until tinged brown, about 5 minutes; add  ancho chili during the last minute. Add broth, cover, and simmer to blend  flavors, about 30 minutes.    3. Combine sour cream, juice, syrup, and cinnamon; chill until used, up to        4    hours.    4. In a food processor or blender, puree vegetables and broth, pumpkin,  honey, sage, and thyme until smooth. (If making ahead, chill covered up to  2 days.) Return puree to pan; heat over medium-high heat until hot. Season  to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle equally into 8 soup bowls; garnish  with a swirl of cinnamon-maple cream and cilantro.
