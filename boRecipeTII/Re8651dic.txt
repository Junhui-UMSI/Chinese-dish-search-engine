Butter, Dried mint, or, Juniper berries, crushed, Nutmeg (fresh if poss.), Fresh mint, Ground sage, or, Dry white wine, Salt, Heavy cream, Rum, Fresh sage, Boneless kid or lamb, Pepper, Ground cinnamon, 
Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle the meat with the salt and  pepper.  Heat the butter in a casserole, and add the sage, juniper berries,  mint, cinnamon and nutmeg. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add  the meat and brown on all sides.  Lower the heat and add the wine. Simmer,  covered, until the meat is tender (it took me a little more than an hour  with the kid I had).  Remove the meat and keep warm. Strain the sauce. Put  the sauce back in the casserole, and stir in the cream and rum. Bring to a  boil and reduce to the consistency of heavy cream. Return the meat to the  sauce and heat through.  Serve with dry boiled rice and green peas. (it  says here: but I served it with wide homemade egg noodles, and I think that  works better than rice would, even if not strictly the way they would do it  in Locarno.)
