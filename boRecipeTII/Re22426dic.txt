Taken from "Puddings, Custards, and Flans"    Butter a two quart sqaure or oblong ovenproof glass baking dish.    Put the bread cubes in a large bowl. In another bowl beat together the  milk, cream, sugar, applesauce, eggs, vanilla and rum. Pour over the bread/  Stir in the pecans and chocolate chips. Pour the puddding into the baking  dish, and pour on 1/3 to 1/2 cup caramel sauce. Let sit for half an hour or  more (the longer bread puddings sit the better the flavor and texture).    Preheat oven to 350 F. and bake for 45 to 50 minutes. The pudding will be  very puffy when done. Let it settle for 10-15 minutes before cutting. Serve  warm with remaining caramel sauce and hot fudge sauce (if desired).    Serves 6-8    Caramel Sauce: Combine the sugar, water and corn syrup in a saucepan. Cook  over medium heat until the syrup thickens and turns golden. Lower the heat  and add the cream, stirring continuously. The mixture will become very  stiff. Still stirring, add the butter and continue cooking for 2 to 3  minutes, or until the caramel is thick and very creamy. Serve warm. Makes 1  cup.
