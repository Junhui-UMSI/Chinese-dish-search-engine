A while back someone asked me for the taiglach recipe I described. I  apologize for my tardiness in posting but I will make up for it by giving  you two not one recipe. Both of these recipes come from when my son was in  the Beth El Nursery School-hes now almost 21 but we still make them every  year. They can in large measure be done by anyone; they dont get ruined  with a lot of handling by little hands.    Mix flour, salt, baking powder, eggs and oil together to form a dough. Roll  into a rope formation about 1/3 inch thick. Cut into small pieces. Bake at  375 in well greased pan for about 10 minutes. Boil honey, sugar, and ginger  for 5 minutes. Add nuts and baked dough. Stir over low heat until mixture  is golden brown. Pour into aluminum throw away pan and mold into shape  desired.
