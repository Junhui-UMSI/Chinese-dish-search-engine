In heavy 3-quart stockpot or soup kettle heat extra-virgin olive oil; saute  onion, carrots and garlic until vegetables are soft but not browned, 10-15  minutes.  Add drained beans and boiling water to stockpot; add thyme, bay  leaves and parsley.  Cover and cook over low heat, adding boiling water  occasionally if necessary, 1 1/2 - 3 hours or until beans are soft (cooking  time varies with age of beans).  When beans are soft add salt and pepper.    For thicker soup remove about 1 1/2 cups of beans, puree in food processor  or blender, and return to pot. For thinner soup add hot water (or crushed  canned tomatoes with juices). Correct seasonings. Transfer soup to tureen  or individual bowls. Garnish with chopped parsley or croutons and drizzle  with a good green olive oil. Makes 8 servings.    Notes:  This recipe can be adapted to almost any kind of bean (cannellini,  Great Northern, anasazi, _pinto_, pinquito, etc. are all possibilities).
