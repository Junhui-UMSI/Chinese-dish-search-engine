Put the filling into this pie crust and then top with a second  crust.       Tuck the edges of the pie crust into the inside of the spring form pan  and decorate the top crust with dough cutouts of flowers, or pigs, or  whatever.       Coat the outer crust with beaten egg yolk and bake.       Bake in a 375 F oven for 1 hour.  Let cool to room temperature before  removing from the springform pan.
