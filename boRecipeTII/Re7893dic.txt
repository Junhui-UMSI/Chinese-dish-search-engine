Posole Salad Soup - Marion Cunningham
Chicken broth, Masa harina, Stewed tomatoes, Yellow hominy, Iceberg lettuce, Avocado, Ground cumin, Cold water, Salt and pepper, Cilantro, 
Mix the masa harina with the cold water and blend until smooth.    In a large saucepan, stir together the broth, cumin, tomatoes, masa harina  mixture, salt and pepper, and hominy. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and  simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Toss together the cilantro and  lettuce in a bowl. Add the avocado to the soup just before serving. Serve  the soup, and pass around the lettuce and cilantro at the table, letting  everyone put some on top of their soup.    NOTE: "It may seems weird putting your salad in the middle of your soup. It  isnt. The salad looks great and stays crunchy in the middle of the soup,  adding a sparkling contrast in texture. Posole is the Spanish name for  hominy soup."
