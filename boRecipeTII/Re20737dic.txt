Apple Delight
Apple; chunks, Egg, Baking Powder, Salt, Sugar, Walnuts, Flour; rounded, Vanilla, 
Beat eggs light.    Add sugar slowly and beat well. Add flour, baking  powder, salt and vanilla.  Beat. Stir in apple chunks and walnuts. Bake in  6 x 9 inch pan (my Mom seems to have the only pan that size, which was my  great-grandmothers pan--a 7 x 11 pan or 8 x 8 works OK).    Double the recipe if you are using a 9 x 13 pan.  I have used rhubarb  instead of apples, and other fruits would work as well.
