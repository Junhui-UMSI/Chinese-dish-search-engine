Alcachofas De Tudela En Salsa (Tudela Artichokes with Sauce)
Garlic, olive oil, Artichokes, Bacon or cured ham, Flour, Onion, 
Clean the artichokes: remove the external leaves and cut off the stem. Cut  off the top leaves with a sharp knife, too. Put the clean artichokes in a  bowl with cold water, to avoid that they become black. In another bowl,  boil water and add the drained artichokes one by one, to avoid that the  water stop boiling. In the meantime, fry the chopped onion in a pan with  oil, the chopped garlic cloves and the sliced bacon or ham. When they  become golden, remove the pan from fire and add the flour. Drain the bowled  artichokes and add to the onion sauce. Serve hot.    I hope you understand my little English and you enjoy this receipe. It  comes from the Saint Claires Convent in Tudela (Navarra), in northern  Spain.
