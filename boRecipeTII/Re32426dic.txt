Basel Brunsli (Basel Chocolate-Spice Cookies)
almonds, Egg whites, almond extract, Unsweetened cocoa powder, Powdered sugar, Ground cinnamon, Bittersweet Chocolate, Ground cloves, 
Heat oven to 325F.  Line several baking sheets with aluminum foil.    In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup powdered sugar until the  almonds are powder-fine but not oily; stop the processor and scrape down  the sides several times.  Add the cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, and  chocolate; continue processing until the chocolate is finely ground.  Add  the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar, the almond extract, and egg whites;  process until the mixture is blended and just forms a mass.  Set the dough  aside for 5 to 10 minutes to stiffen slightly.    Generously dust a work surface with powdered sugar.  If the dough seems too  soft to roll out easily, dust it with more sugar and knead until the  consistency is manageable, but avoid adding any more sugar than absolutely  necessary.  Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch thickness, lifting it with a  spatula frequently and redusting the surface and rolling pin with powdered  sugar to prevent sticking.  Cut out the cookies using a 2 1/4-inch  heart-shaped (or similar) cutter.  Use a spatula to transfer the cookies to  the prepared baking sheets, about 1 inch apart.    Bake the cookies for 9 to 12 minutes or until almost firm on top and  slightly puffy.  Let them stand on the foil lined baking sheets until  completely cooled.  Peel from the foil.  Store airtight for 3 to 4 days.  Freeze, airtight, for longer storage.    Makes about forty 2 1/4-inch cookies.    [THE BALTIMORE SUN;  November 25. 1990]    Posted by Fred Peters.
