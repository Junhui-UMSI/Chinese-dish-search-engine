Dissolve the miso in the water.  Dissolve the cornstarch in a small amount  of hot water and add to the miso, along with the soy sauce and 5-spice mix.  Set aside.    Heat the wok, then add the oil; heat for a minute and swirl around to coat  the wok.  Add the garlic and ginger, stir around until the garlic starts to  brown.  Add the mushrooms, toss for about 3 minutes until they start to  soften.  Add the carrots, stir for about 2 minutes; then the broccoli,  another minute; then the water chestnuts, another minute; then the tofu.  Add a splash of sake, stir for another minute or two as the steam melds  everything, then pour on the sauce.  Stir until it thickens (about 3  minutes), then serve with rice or noodles.    The portabellos have a chewey, firm body and a rather strong flavor, very  nice!  I think next Ill try some kind of dish mixing whole caps with  eggplant...Ill let you know in a week or so!    as always, "eat! eat!"
