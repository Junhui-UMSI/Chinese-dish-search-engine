Beat in lemon rind and juice. Mix flour, baking powder  and salt. Stir flour mixture and ground almonds into butter mixture to make  a soft dough. Divide dough into quarters. Refrigerate dough, wrapped in wax  paper, until firm, at least 8 hours or overnight.     2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.     3. Roll out one dough portion on lightly floured pastry cloth with a  rolling pin covered with stocking or roll between sheets of lightly floured  wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut out with cookie cutters. Return dough  to refrigerator if it gets too soft. Transfer to baking sheets, leaving 2  inches between each cookie. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired.     4. Bake until very light brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to wire  racks to cool. Store in a covered tin.     This second-place winner, from Judy M. Drux of Dyer, Indiana, makes very  thin, crisp, delicate cookies. The dough keeps well in the refrigerator if  well-wrapped. This cookie was a tribute to her husbands grandmother,  Antonia Drux, who emigrated to this country from Germany in 1923. (Oma  means "grandma" in German.) The recipe has been passed down as just a list  of ingredients. Drux added a few hints to help make baking them easier for  future cooks. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide Holiday  Cookie Contest December 5, 1991  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 11:24:32 +0000
