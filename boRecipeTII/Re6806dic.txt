Pollo Euscaro (Basque Chicken)
Eggplant, Bacon drippings, Chicken, Tomato, Garlic, Dry thyme, Salt, Sweet green pepper, Dry basil, Black Pepper, Dry white wine, Onions, Butter, 
Brown the chicken well in the butter and bacon  drippings.  Season with salt and pepper, and place in  a deep casserole which has a cover. In the fat in  which the chicken was browned, stir together the  mushrooms, eggplant, tomato, green pepper, onions,  garlic, basil and thyme for 2 to 3 minutes until the  vegetables just begin to soften. Add to the  chicken in the casserole.  Pour the wine into the  skillet, scrape loose any brown bits from the bottom  and pour with the wine over the chicken. Cover the  casserole and bake in a moderate oven (350 F.) for  about 45 minutes or until the chicken is tender.  Dont even consider using a crockpot; this is  enormously superior. NOTE:  The small amount of wine  is all the liquid needed.  Plenty of       water is released from the vegetables, so there  is no danger of       the food going dry and burning.
