Here is our adaptation of aigo bouido, the restorative Proven?al garlic  soup. Simmering the garlic tames its bite. A green salad and crusty bread  round out the meal.    Heat olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, saute  until golden, about 10 minutes. Add broth, potatoes, garlic and bay leaf;  bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until potatoes  are very tender, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly. Discard bay leaf.  Coarsely puree soup in blender 1 cup at a time, about 20 seconds per batch  (do not overprocess). Return soup to same saucepan. Season to taste with  salt and pepper. Simmer until heated through. Ladle soup into bowls.  Sprinkle with chives and thyme and serve.          4    Servings    Bon App?tit May 1995    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Feb 26, 1998
