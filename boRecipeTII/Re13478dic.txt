Cooks note: You can use less olive oil, if desired; however, the olive oil  lends a lot of flavor to the soup.    1. In a heavy-bottomed soup pot or Dutch oven, cook the red onion in the  olive oil on medium heat until onion softens, 3-4 minutes.    2. Add peppers, celery and tomatoes; stir to coat well for 1-2 minutes.  Reduce heat to low, cover and slowly cook the vegetables, about 10 minutes.  If needed, add a little hot water.    3. Add 4 1/2 cups cold water and bring to boil on high heat. Lower heat and  simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.    4. Meanwhile, toast bread and break into bite-sized pieces. Stir in basil.    Presentation: Distribute bread among 4 soup bowls. Ladle soup over bread.
