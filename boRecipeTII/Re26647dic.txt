Baileys - # 6
Instant coffee, Sweetened condensed milk, Eggs, Almond extract, Pure vanilla extract, Irish whiskey, 
Method: Add flavorings to whiskey and blend in blender. Add milk and blend  on low speed for 1 minute. Add eggs and pulse stir for 1 minute (use the  lowest speed on blender and turn on-off about eight times). Makes about 4  cups. From Alan Burgstahler. He seems partial to 10 ounce cups. I think  Alan has very variable cups; see the next recipe.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 09 Dec 96    From:    Bob Pastorio <pastorio@RICA.NET>    Date:    Mon, 9 Dec 1996 18:56:25 -0800
