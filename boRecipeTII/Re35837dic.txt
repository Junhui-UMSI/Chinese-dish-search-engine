Stuffed French Toast with Apricot Glaze
Eggs, Half and half, (8 oz) cream cheese, milk, Slivered almonds, Cinnamon; (or to taste), Vanilla, Almond extract, Loaf unsliced sourdough, Nutmeg, Jar; (12 oz) apricot, (16 oz) apricots; drained, 
In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese and the almond extract until  fluffy. Stir in the nuts. Cut the bread into 3/4 inch slices, then make a  cut (about 2 inches) on the bottom of each piece of bread. It needs to be  large enough to create a pocket that will hold about one teaspoon of the  cream cheese mixture. Stuff in the cream cheese mixture. Beat together the  eggs , half and half, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. Dip the stuffed bread  into the egg mixture and allow it to get thoroughly moist but not heavily  soaked. Cook the bread on lightly greased griddle until golden. Heat the  preserves, slice the apricots into thirds and add to the preserves with the  nutmeg. Drizzle over the cooked toast.
