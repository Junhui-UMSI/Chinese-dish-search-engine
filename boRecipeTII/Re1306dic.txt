From  Leslie March    Place grape leaves in a flat bowl. Pour boiling water over and drain. saute  onion in 2 tablespoons olive oil until soft, add parsley, rice, nuts,dill,  raisins and lemon peel. saute 3-4 minutes, until nuts are brown. Pour in 1  1/2 cups broth. Cover, reduce heat, simmer until liquid is absorbed, 12-15  minutes. Place leaves on flat surface, vein side up. Fill with about 1  tablespoons filling and roll up, tucking ends in. Mix 1 1/2 cups broth with  1/2 cup olive oil and lemon juice. Place stuffed grape leaves in deep  kettle or dutch oven, seam side down. After first layer, pour half of broth  mixture over leaves, add rest of leaves and rest of broth mixture. Bring to  boil over medium heat, cover, reduce heat and simmer 45  minutes. I like  these best at room temperature, but they can also be served hot or cold.    Comments from Estela:...In Istanbul, the woman who taught me to make them  used currants instead of raisins, and in some restaurants bulghur wheat was  substituted for the rice,which made for a nicer filling. The grape leaves  are rolled into small tight tubes that look like cigar stubs and are placed  compactly in the pot to keep them from undoing during cooking. ...I do mine  in the microwave with a minimal amount of liquid. Its quick and works  great. Estela    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Beth Ide" <rev_ide@email.msn.com> on Aug  30, 1998
