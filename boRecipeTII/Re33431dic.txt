Basics- Fresh Pasta
Fresh pasta, Salt, Water, 
Basics for new cooks:    In large pot, cover and bring water and salt to full rolling boil. Stir in  pasta, separating pieces; return to boil and boil, uncovered and stirring  occasionally, for 1-3 minutes or until tender but firm. Drain well.    Tip: If a sauce is to be served on pasta, do not rinse. The starch on the  surface of the pasta will allow the sauce to cling to the pasta.
