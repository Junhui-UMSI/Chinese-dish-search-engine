Add potatoes  and cook until golden, stirring often, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low.  Add chili powder and cumin and cook 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, sliced green  onions and tomato sauce. Cover and cook until potatoes are tender, about 6  minutes. Add 1/3 c Jack cheese, egg, cilantro, and jalapeno and stir until  cheese melts. Season with salt and cayenne.    Brush large skillet with oil and place over medium heat. Add 1 tortilla and  cook until softened, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to work surface. Top  tortilla with 1/3 cup filling and roll up. Place seam side down in baking  dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling, brushing skillet with  oil as necessary. (Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Enchilada Sauce<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<    Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add  chopped onions and garlic and saute 5 minutes. Mix in cumin seeds, chili  powder, dried oregano and ground cinnamon and saute 1 minute. Add enchilada  sauce and tomato sauce and simmer 2 minutes. Mix in fresh lime juice.  Season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days  ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat before using.)    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Topping<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<< <<<<<<    Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour enchilada sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle  with feta and remaining 1 1/3 cups Jack cheese. Cover with foil. Bake until  heated through and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Serve with sour cream and  green onions.    Note: Although Im sure that the _Bon Appetite_ chefs know exactly what  they are talking about, I find that, at high temperatures, olive oil breaks  down a great deal, begins to smoke, and sets off fire alarms all over. I  use peanut oil and a wok to saute potatoes since, as far as skillets go, I  dont have non-stick and heavy all in one. Additionally, I dont use any  extra salt in the dish, finding it amply seasoned without.
