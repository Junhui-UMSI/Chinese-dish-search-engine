Tempura Batter
Sauce, Egg yolks, Flour, Cold water, Sugar, Batter, Sake, Clam broth      1, Vegetable oil., 
/4      c  soy sauce Mix the batter with the exception of the oil. Dip food  such as shrimp,lobster scallops and vegetables such as broccoli,pea pods,  in batter and dunk in hot oil,fry till lightly browned. This may sound like  a hard appetizer but I heat oil in a pan till hot,pour into fondue pot and  let the guests make their own.They seem to enjoy doing this. FROM: JEAN  RHYNER    (DMNN05B)
