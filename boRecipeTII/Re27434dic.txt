Todds Christmas Cake
Dates, Sugar, Eggs, Cherries, Baking Powder, Chocolate chips, Flour, Walnuts, Salt, 
Whips eggs well.  Add flour, sugar, salt and baking powder to large bowl  and mix well.  Mix in the goodies. Lick bowl! Place in 8x3x4 cake pan. If  you use pan, line it with wax paper. I use tin foil. Its much easier to  wrap as a gift. Bake at 325 for 1 1/2 hours. Use a toothpick to see if  done.  You should not get anything but chocolate. There should be a good  crust and be brown. Make sure not too soft in the middle.
