Penne and Asparagas
Grated Parmesan, Hot Sauce, Penne, Asparagus; broken into bite, Crushed red pepper, 
(I use Pea Pods at other times of the year)    Cook the Penne according to pkg directions. Steam/saute the Asparagus just  until it turns a bright green :) Drain the Asparagus badly  :) so that you retain a little of the cooking water. Mix Asparagus & Penne.  Add a few shakes each of Parmesan, Hot Sauce & Red Pepper and mix gently.  Taste & add more if you like.    My husband & my little greens eater like it best this way. She likes more  cheese & he like more hot sauce. I really prefer asparagus plainer. I just  steam/saute it, then right before I drain it I squeeze a lemon over the  whole pan. After I drain it I add freshly ground black pepper. Then I eat  it with my fingers. Eating it with your fingers is important!!    Posted to fatfree digest by marya <marya@netcom.com> on Apr 10, 1998
