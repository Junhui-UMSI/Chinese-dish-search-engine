Ball Blue Book Salsa
Garlic, Hot pepper sauce, Hot peppers, Cilantro, Cider vinegar, Salt, Green peppers, Tomatoes, Onion, 
Mix everything together in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce  heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Ladle into hot pint canning jars, put on  lids and rings and process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. Makes 6  pints.    NOTES : This uses about 6 pounds tomatoes, 2 pounds green pepper and 1 1/2  pounds onion.  Depending on your tastes and how hot your peppers are, you  may want to use less hot pepper.  3/4 cup finely chopped jalapenos, with no  hot pepper sauce added, makes a mild to medium salsa. I try to use at least  half Roma tomatoes (or other paste tomatoes) to keep it from being too  runny.  You could also drain off some of the tomato juices before mixing  everything together. The recipe says it makes 6 pints, but Ive always  gotten 7 or 8 pints from one recipe.  Recipe by: Ball Blue Book Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n215 by Jenny Herl  <jlherl@uiuc.edu> on Aug 26, 1997
