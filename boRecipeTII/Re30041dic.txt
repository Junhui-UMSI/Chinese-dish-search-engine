Balls of Fire
Fresh jalapeno pepper, salt and pepper, Ground sirloin, Olive oil, Canola oil, Parmesan cheese, French bread, Egg, Onion, Cilantro, Milk, 
To make meatballs: Soak bread in milk. Squeeze it lightly. Add to sirloin,  discarding any extra milk. Chop onion fine.    Using rubber gloves, wash jalapeno. Remove and discard stem. Chop extra  fine. Open all windows in kitchen. Saute onion and jalapeno lightly in oil.  (Note: If fumes bother you, cover pan; if they still bother you, consider  mixture sauteed enough.)    Cool slightly. Add to meat mixture, blending well. Beat egg lightly. Add  Parmesan, cilantro, salt and black pepper. Add to meat mixture. Blend  together well.    Wearing rubber gloves, form meat mixture into balls, approximately 1 inch  in diameter. Separate balls into 2 batches.    To cook meatballs: Pour oil into cast-iron skillet so a 1/2 inch of oil  covers bottom. Heat until piece of meat mixture dropped in oil sizzles.  Turn heat to medium high. Fry first batch of meatballs until undersides  brown. Roll them over so other side browns. Remove from oil with slotted  spoon. Drain well on paper towels. Fry second batch of meatballs in same  oil.    Note: These mildly hot meatballs make excellent appetizers (best if served  within two hours of cooking) and may be served with Sizzling Salsa as a dip  , or with homemade or canned spaghetti sauce as an entree. To make them  zippier, add another jalapeno.    Note for me: fairly mild - add more jalapeno. Tasty.    _From by Susan Hazen-Hammond and Eduardo Fuss.
