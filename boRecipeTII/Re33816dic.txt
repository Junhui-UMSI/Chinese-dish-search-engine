If you are using pork steak, freeze it just until firm and then slice it  into very thin strips. For ham, cut into long strips about 3/8-inch on a  side.    Brown meat in frying pan or wok, use oil if necessary. Drain pineapple  juice from canned pineapple into a measuring cup and add water if necessary  to get correct amount of liquid. Add this to fry pan or wok. Stir in brown  gravy mix, vinegar and ginger. Add pineapple and green pepper. Simmer about  10 minutes, just until liquid begins to thicken. Serve over rice.
