From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva)    Date: Tue, 20 Jul 1993 16:22:59 GMT  This is a wonderful recipe.  It calls for frozen fruit, but I dont see why  you couldnt substitute fresh fruit if available.    Thaw and drain fruit.  Slice sponge cake into three thin layers.  Place one  layer in the bottom of a serving bowl.  It should be flat-bottomed and  about 10 inches across and five inches deep. If you have one of glass, use  it because the layers of the trifle look very pretty. Sprinkle the cake  layer with one-quarter cup sherry. Spread about 1 third of the raspberries  and peach slices on top. Pour one-third of the custard over the fruit.  Repeat cake, sherry, fruit and custard layers, saving a dozen or so  raspberries for garnish. To make the topping, beat egg white until stiff  and in a separate bowl, whip cream. Stir sugar into cream and gently fold  in beaten egg white. Mound cream and egg white mixture over the top of the  trifle.  Garnish with raspberries and toasted almonds. Refrigerate until  ready to serve.    Custard Sauce: Scald milk in a double boiler.  Meanwhile, beat egg yolks  and add sugar and salt. Pour a little hot milk into the egg yolk mixture,  beating with a fork, and then stir into the rest of the milk. Place over  simmering, not boiling, water and cook -- stirring until the mixture coats  a metal spoon. Pour the cutard into a bowl and stir in the vanilla. Cover  and refrigerate for one hour or until thickened before adding to trifle.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
