Basic Easy Crust
Egg, All-purpose flour, Margarine, Ice water, -(up to), White vinegar, Crisco lard, Salt, 
This is a very easy yet flaky piecrust. I use a pastry blender, for me an  absolute must. Some people get away with blending with a fork, but I rarely  have any luck doing this. In the old days lard was used instead of the  lighter shortenings that we have now. Lard does make a delicious crust, but  it is really hard on the old heart. I suggest the following:      In a medium-size bowl stir the flour and salt together. Cut in the  shortenings using a pastry blender. Keep working the flour and shortening  until the mixture is rather grainy, like coarse cornmeal. Mix the egg and  vinegar together and, using a wooden fork, stir the mixture into the flour.  Add enough ice water so that the dough barely holds together. Place on a  marble pastry board or a plastic countertop and knead for just a few turns,  enough so that the dough holds together and becomes rollable.      I roll my dough out on a piece of waxed paper. It is easy to handle that  way. If you have a marble rolling pin this will be easy. If you use a  wooden one be sure to dust a teaspoon of flour on it a couple of times when  you are rolling the dough.    NOTE: If you wish to use this recipe for a fruit or sweet pie simply stir  in 1 tablespoon of sugar along with the flour and salt. This recipe will  make enough dough for one 9-inch pie with two crusts, top and bottom.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
