Incredibly simple when made in a breadmaker, this recipe yields one 12-inch  (or if you have a larger machine, a 15-inch) pizza crust.    Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft in the bread pan. Carefully  measure the flours, salt, and the sugar, and transfer to the pan. Add the  water, oil, and yeast. Place the bread pan inside the machine and close the  lid.    Program the breadmaker for the whole wheat dough mode. At the end of the  rising cycle, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and  let rest for 10 minutes.    Lightly oil a 12-inch (or 15-inch) pizza pan and sprinkle with the  cornmeal. With floured hands, gently stretch the dough into a 12-inch (or  15-inch) circle and place in the prepared pan. Continue stretching until  the dough covers the entire surface if the pan. Push the dough against the  rim of the pan to make an edge, then top the dough with your choice of  pizza fillings.    Bake the pizza on the bottom rack of a preheated 400F oven for 20 to 25  minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is melted and bubbly.  Serve hot.
