Cut the beef when it is partially frozen, and cut it across the grain into  thin slices.    Stir baking soda solution into the beef (to help tenderize it). Stir in the  marinade.  Then stir in 1 tsp peanut oil and marinate the beef for one hour  or more in the refrigerator.    Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil over high heat, add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir in  asparagus.  Add 1/4 cup water. Cover pan for 2 minutes, and do not lift  lid.  When done, remove to a platter.    Over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil.  Stir-fry the RINSED black beans  and garlic mixture.  Stir for a few seconds. Add the beef. Stir-fry quickly  until barely. Do not overcook or the beef will become tough. Sizzle in 1  tablespoon of rice wine and 2 teaspoons of soy sauce. Stir in asparagus.    Add gravy mixture.  Stir until thickened.  Serve hot.    SOURCE: Stella Chans Secrets in the Art of Chinese Cooking.    Posted by Cate Vanicek
