Tomato Consomme (Hl)
Sea salt to taste, Inch cheesecloth, Ripe plum tomatoes, 
Core the tomatoes and chop them coarsely. Put them in a food processor, as  many as will fit at a time. Mince them to a pulp(seeds, skins and all).    Place tomato pulp in a large stockpot and bring to a rapid boil. Let boil  for five minutes.    Wet the cheesecloth and wring it dry. Spread it out and over the inside of  a large fine mesh strainer. Pour the tomato pulp and its liquid in the  cheesecloth strainer and let it drip. After about 30 minutes, pour all the  liquid in a small pot. Discards the solids or use them elsewhere. Reduce  the liquid until the flavor has intensified satisfactorily, about one third  to one half its volume. Salt to taste. Oversalting will result in too  acidic a broth.
