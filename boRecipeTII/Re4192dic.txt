Perfect Brown Rice
Water, Long-grain brown rice, Salt, 
*You may substitute chicken, beef, or vegetable broth. If using  non-low-sodium broth, omit salt.    In a medium-size (1 1/2 quart) heavy saucepan, combine 2 1/4 cups water or  broth with rice and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring well. Cover, then cook  on medium-low for 25 minutes. Check the rice for tenderness and continue  cooking 5 minutes, covered, if necessary. Remove from the heat and let set        5    minutes. Fluff with a fork.    Makes 3 cups.
