Picque
Jalapeno peppers, Wine vinegar, Black peppercorns, Sprig fresh rosemary, Serrano peppers, Habanero peppers, 
In a book called Hot Licks by Jennifer Traynor Thompson, she gives a recipe  for Picque, a Carribean condiment. It is great on salads, as a veggie dip,  or on green beans, rice, whatever. You will find this on just about every  kitchen table down there. The longer you keep it, the hotter it gets. It  need no refrigeration. The vinegar preserves everything. Besides, the heat  of a habanero can kill anything. Yum...
