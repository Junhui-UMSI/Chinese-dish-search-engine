Apricot Brandy Eggnog
Egg yolks, Heavy cream, chipped, Nutmeg, Apricot brandy, Powdered sugar, Cold milk, 
In a large bowl, with and electirc mixer at medium speed, beat the yolks  until very light.  Gradually beat in the sugar.  Slowly pour in the brandy  while beating constantly.  Let rest about 10 minutes.  Gradually beat in  the milk.  Refrigerate, covered, until very well chilled.  I prefer to make  it at least 1 month ahead to allow the flavors to meld.    When ready to serve, pour the eggnog into a punch bowl.  Beat the heavy  cream and fold into the eggnog just until blended.  Grate fresh nutmeg over  the top.
