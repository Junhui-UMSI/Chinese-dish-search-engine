Potato Patties
Egg, slightly beaten, Green pepper, chopped, Vegetable oil, Potatoes, seasoned & mashed, Onion, finely chopped, 
Combine all ingredients except oil; mix well.  Shape into six patties.  Brown well in hot oil, about 4 minutes on each side. I use leftover mashed  potatoes myself. Randy Rigg
