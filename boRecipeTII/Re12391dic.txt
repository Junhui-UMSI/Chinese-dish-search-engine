PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Warm a tablespoon of oil in a large pan and add  the onion, garlic and half the herbes de Provence, and salt lightly. Stew  gently for about 5 minutes, then remove the onions to a gratin dish and  spread them evenly over the bottom. Season with pepper. Warm another  tablespoon of oil in the same skillet, raise the heat to medium-high and  add the zucchini, a few pinches of salt and the rest of the herbes de  Provence. Saute, stirring occasionally, until they start to color, about 10  minutes. Distribute the zucchini over the onions; arrange them casually.  Tuck in the slices of tomato here and there, along with the olives. Drizzle  the remaining oil over the top. Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes.  Remove the foil and continue to bake another 10 minutes or so, or until the  squash is tender and the juices are reduced. Allow to cool and serve warm  or tepid.
