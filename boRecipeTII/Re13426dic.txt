I love little meat pies of any description.  In the case of samosas,  they dont even have to have meat in em.  Heres a series of seven  recipes from all over the world for "turnovers".    Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of the warm water.  Let stand for  10 minutes until bubbly.  Then stir in remaining warm water 1/3 cup  olive oil, salt and whole-wheat flour.  Mix well.    Stir in 2 cups white flour and as much of the rest as needed to make  a soft dough.  Knead well.  Oil the sides of a large bowl with the  remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Put the dough in the bowl and  turn to coat with oil.  Let rise until doubled, 1 hour.  Punch dough  down and let sit for 10 minutes.    Roll dough into 20 x 24-inch rectangle and cut into 4 x 4-inch  squares. Fill with the salmon-rice or other desired filling.  Fold  over and seal. Trim excess pastry and decorate top of turnover.  Let  rise for 10 minutes. Mix egg and milk (or cream or water) to make an  egg wash and brush it on top of the turnover.  Bake in a 400F oven  for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.    Makes 30 pasties.    From the San Francisco Chronicle, 8/10/88.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; November 11 1992.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip
