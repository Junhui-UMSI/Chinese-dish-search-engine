Angel Hair with Red Pepper Sauce
Salt, Pepper, Red onion, Garlic, Basil; (we used dried), Water, Lemon juice, Servings angel hair, Red peppers, Ff rice milk; (optional), 
toss the 2 peppers whole into a broiler/toaster oven or regular oven at 375  degrees for 20 min., turning every 5 min to make sure all sides are  slightly charred. Remove and plunge into ice water, which will shrivel the  peppers and allow you to peel the skin off in a breeze. After peeled, seed  and coarsely chop the peppers. While the peppers are roasting, water-fry  the onion and garlic til they give up (just translucent  :-) when done, toss into a food processor and process a few seconds. Add  the peppers, lemon juice, and seasonings to the processor and puree til  slightly smooth (we used a bit of rice milk to thin it down a bit). Seve  immedaitely (it will still be warm) over the pasta.    Posted to fatfree digest V98 #004 by Bloodroses@webtv.net (Audney R.  Terry\) (string bean) on Jan 4, 1998
