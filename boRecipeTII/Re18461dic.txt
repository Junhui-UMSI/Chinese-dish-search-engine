Chop onions and shred cabbage into a large glass or crockery bowl. Do not  use a metal bowl. Dissolve salt in 1 quart of water and pour over vegetable  mix. Cover and let soak overnight.    In the morning, turn vegetables into a large colander and drain.    In a large pot, dissolve brown sugar in cider vinegar. Mix mustard powder  and turmeric with 1/2 cup water; add flour, mixing to make a thick paste  with no lumps. Add to vinegar-brown sugar mixture; stir to blend, again  making sure there are no lumps. Add celery and mustard seed and bring to a  boil over medium-high heat, stirring to prevent sticking. The mixture will  thicken as it comes to a boil. When it boils, add cabbage and onion and  continue to boil and stir for 5 minutes. Mixture is very pungent. Put in  sterile jars, close with sterile lids and put in a boiling water bath for  15 minutes to seal. Makes about 1 1/2 quarts.
