Preheat oven to 350. Prepare 2-9" round cake pans with cooking spray  and flour; set aside. To prepare batter, combine cake mix, Dream  Whip, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. In another mixing bowl,  combine water, egg whites, oil, and vanilla. Mix dry ingredients with  wet ingredients just until moistened. Bake for 25 minutes or until  golden brown. Cool. Place cake layers, top sides up, in prepared cake  pans. Pierce cake with large fork at 1/2" intervals. To prepare  filling, stir 1 cup of the boiling water into each flavor of gelatin  in separate bowls 2 minutes or until dissolved. Carefully pour red  gelatin over 1 cake layer and lime gelatin over second cake layer.  Refrigerate 3 hours. Dip 1 cake pan in warm water 10 seconds; unmold  onto serving plate. Meanwhile, to prepare topping, follow directions  according to package. Spread with about 1/4 of the topping over top  of first cake layer. Unmold second cake layer; carefully place on  first layer. Frost top and sides of cake with remaining topping.  Refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to serve.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
