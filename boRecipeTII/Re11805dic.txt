"As the grand chef, I went into the yard to harvest  squash blossoms and marigolds for our ravioli of fresh flowers. Since we  grew them ourselves, we felt a real sense of accomplishment. As for the  wonton skins, they have, in our experience, an intriguing texture that  cause ones mind to wander. Just toss the ravioli    with some good pepper and fresh Parmesan to bring everything back into  focus."
