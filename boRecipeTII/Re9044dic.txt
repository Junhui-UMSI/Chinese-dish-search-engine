Sprinkle the rum over the  macaroon crumbs and let stand until well moistened. Soften the chocolate ic  cream slightly--until is can be pressed into the mold. Do not let it melt  into a liquid. Pack firmly onto the bottom of the mold and well into the  sides. Sprinkle with a layer of 1/3 of the macaroon crumbs. Cover hte mold  and freeze until the crumbs and ice cream are hard. Let the vanilla ice  cream soften and pack it into the mold, top with half of the remaining=  crumbs. Cover the mold and freeze again. Repeat with the strawberry ice  cream and the rest of the crumbs. Cover the mold and freeze for 6 to 8  hours or until the ice cream is very hard. Unmold and slice in long wedges  to serve. Serve plain or garnish with whipped cream and fresh strawberries  or shaved= chocolate.    Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #95
