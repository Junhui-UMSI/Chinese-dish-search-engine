Garry Howard, Cambridge, MA. <garhow@hpubmaa.esr.hp.com>    Recipe By: John Bilos - jbilos@labs-n.bbn.com    The following appetizer is sure to be a crowd pleaser. I have never taken  it anywhere without being asked for the recipe.    Cup up pita bread into chip size triangles, separate and bake on a cookie  sheet until crispy (approx 5 minutes).    Combine all other ingredients and mash (a KitchenAid mixer works great).    Bake in an uncovered casserole dish for approx 30 minutes @ 350 or until  bubbly.    Serve hot out of the oven and scoop up dip with pita bread. If you intend  to take this to a party or are having friends over be prepared to recite  this recipe a number of times. My wife and I bring xerox copies with us!  John Bilos    NOTES: I got this recipe off the internet five years ago and have made it  many times. I made it to take to a party this past New Years Eve (95). It  was originally posted by John Bilos at Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. in  Cambridge, MA. What he says is true. Someone asked for the recipe again on  New Years Eve.    I create my own adaption of the recipe by adding some green chiles. The  last time I made it, I used about 4 poblano chiles and 3 hot New Mexican  chiles roasted and chopped. I personally think this is a delicious  addition!
