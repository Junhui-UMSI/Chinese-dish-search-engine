Tvp Chili
Chili powder, Salt, To 2 cloves, To large onion, chopped, Pace medium picanti, 16 oz can diced tomatoes, 8 oz can tomato sauce, Taco Seasoning (more or, To 1 t dried basil, Chili powder, Wine or balsamic vinegar, Boiling water to cover, TVP, Less), Green pepper, To 2 cans kidney beans, 
Soak about 1 cup of TVP in boiling water, to cover, with several tbsp taco  seasoning, extra chili powder, and salt to taste...let it sit until the TVP  has soaked up much of the water and flavor from the spices. Meanwhile,  saute 1 chopped green pepper, 1 chopped med/large onion, and 1-2 cloves  finely chopped garlic in wine or balsamic vinegar until the onion is  translucent. Stir in one can of diced tomatoes (~16 oz), one or two cans of  drained and *rinsed* kidney beans, one can of tomato sauce (8 oz), chili  powder, and 1/2-1 tsp dried basil (or several chopped leaves if fresh).  Drain excess liquid from the TVP (so there isnt a puddle of water...it can  still be wet) and add to the rest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer  20 minutes or more. To each bowl my SO and I like a big blob of Pace medium  picante, but my 6 yo likes it plain with baked Tostitos.    Source: Apparent original.
