Wacky Chocolate Cake
Salt, Cold water, Baking soda, Cocoa, Flour, Sugar, Vanilla, Vegetable oil, Vinegar, 
Sift dry ingredients into a 9 inch square ungreased pan. Make 3 holes in  dry mixture. Measure oil in one, vinegar in second, vanilla in third. Pour  cold water over all. Mix with rubber spatula until blended. Do not beat.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes, cool. Frost if desired. Note: My  sons favourite icing is to add chocolate chips to the top of the cake when  it first comes out of the oven. He lets the chips melt and spreads the  chocolate over the cake.
