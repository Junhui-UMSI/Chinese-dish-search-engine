My sister just sent me a great cookbook - Biker Billy Cooks With Fire! Not  only is it funny, and informative, the recipes look pretty good!  Barb AKA  Brad was asking for salsa recipes without tomatoes - I found these two in  the book:    Heat the oil in a small saute pan over medium heat.  Add the habanero and  onion and saute for 3 to 5 minutes or until the onion is transparent. In a  blender or a food processor equipped with a chopping blade, puree the bell  pepper and the water for 30 seconds.  Add the puree, white pepper, salt,  and molasses to the onion mixture.  Reduce the heat to low; cover; simmer  for 10 minutes.  Serve warm.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #129    Date: Thu, 10 Oct 1996 17:40:24 -0500    From: Coyote Moon <coyote@usaor.net>
