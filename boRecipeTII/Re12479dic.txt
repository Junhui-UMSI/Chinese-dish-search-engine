Cheesecakes and other dairy treats are customary for the Jewish festival of  Shavuoth.    To make crust: Lightly oil a 9-inch springform pan, or coat it with non-  stick cooking spray.    Place zwieback in a food processor with sugar and cinnamon. Add oil, butter  and 2 tb. water. Process until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Reserve 2  tb. of the crumb mixture for the top of the torte. Press the remaining  crumb mixture into the bottom and sides of the springform pan. Set aside.    To make filling: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine  milk and cornstarch. Whisk until smooth; set aside. In a food processor,  puree cottage cheese and sour cream until smooth, about 1 minute. Add  sugar, egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon zest, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and  milk mixture and process.    In a large mixing bowl, beat 4 egg whites until stiff but not dry. Fold the  cheese mixture into the egg whites with a spatula. Pour into the prepared  pan.    Sprinkle with the reserved crumbs and bake for 1 hour, or until well  puffed. (There will be a few cracks.) Turn off the oven and leave the torte  in the oven for 1 hour with the door closed, to cool gradually. Remove from  oven; transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The cake may be stored,  covered, for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.) Serve garnished with  strawberries.
