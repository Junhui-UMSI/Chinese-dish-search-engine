Preheat oven to 350F. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add mushrooms and  onions and cook, stirring until the onions are browned. Stir in the barley,  parsley, thyme and pepper(ground). Stir in the cheese; set aside. Rinse the  bell peppers. Cut off the tops; remove and discard the seeds and pith. If  necessary, make a thin slice on the bottom of each pepper to balance.

Bake 30 minutes or until the peppers are tender.    ~--
