Baked Bean Cassarole
Frankfurters cut in pieces;, Heinz Vegetarian Baked Beans, Prepared brown mustard, Brown sugar, PER CAN, Chilie Sauce; (not salsa), 
This is my Moms invention. She used to make her own from scratch back in  the 1940s. I remeber peering into the big brown bowl with the white beans  soaking into it, but found she could use this recepie without loss of  flavor and with much saving of time and effort. My brother and I used to  use this for hugh parties in graduate student days. We once made it with 15  cans of beans for a big crowd and with no loss of flavor. You can make it ,  either parev, without the ffranks or Fleishig.    Mix all ingredients and put in a covered baking dish or cassarole and bake  in a 350 F oven for at least 30 min. You will neeed more time if you are  making alot, as the mass has to heat through and cook for a while.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "W. Baker" <wbaker@panix.com> on May 12,  1998
