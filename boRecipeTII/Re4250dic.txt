Perfect WW Bread
Flour, Flour, Water, Add:, Yeast, Add:, Add:, Vegetable oil, Honey, salt, Whole-wheat flour, 
*NOTE: I grind up 15-16 cups of flour first.  Then I pour into my Kitchen  Aid mixing bowl    I grind my own wheat which is Hard White Spring Wheat from Montana and I  use Fermipan Yeast.  When I got this recipe from an acquaintance last year  I asked her what her brands she used of everything in the recipe and this  is exactly what I am sharing with you.  It is a lighter colored wheat bread  and has a wonderful flavor that does not leave a bitter sort of aftertaste  that I have experienced with my previous brands of wheat.    Let the first 4 ingredients sit for a few minutes to "proof" - it will  begin to "grow" and will look bubbly and foamy.    Add whole-wheat flour and mix for 1 minute.    Add veg oil and salt, mix together another 1 minute.    Add flour until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.    Knead and rise as usually for any basic bread dough.    This will make 3 very large loaves or 4-5 smaller pan size loaves or it is  fun to make 12 of the very small loaves (maybe 2 1/2 x 3" pans)    Now the sources:  I buy the Fermipan yeast from the K-Tech stores when I am  visiting my kids in Utah.  There is a K-Tech store in Linden and one in  Orem, and I am sure there are others around Salt Lake City. Here is the  address off of the Fermipan package that I just opened:    Food Ingredients, Inc. King of Prussia, PA 19406 1-800-662-GIST    The Hard White Spring Wheat I also have purchased at the K-Tech Store, but  they gave me the phone number of the farm in Montana that they purchase  from so that I could call and get the name of distributors in my area  (Portland, Oregon).  So here is that phone number:    Wheat Montana 1-800-535-2798        (These people were very helpful)    Hope your results from this information is as successful as mine.  I will  be glad to help anyone further if needed.    Bon Appetit! Pat Hewitt hewitt@sequent.com Sequent Computer Systems Inc.
