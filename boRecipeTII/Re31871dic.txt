In mixer bowl combine 3 cups flour, remaining 1/3 cup sugar and  the salt. At low speed gradually beat in milk, oil, eggs and yeast mixture;  beat until well blended. Beat in additional flour (about 1 1/2 cups) until  dough pulls away from the sides of bowl. On floured surface knead dough  until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning  to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm, draftfree place until doubled  in bulk, 1 hour.    Filling: In mixer bowl beat all ingredients until smooth; set aside. Grease  two 9 inch round cake pans. On lightly floured surface roll dough into an  18x10" rectangle. Spread with filling. Roll tightly from long side. Cut  into fourteen 1 1/4 inch slices. Place 1 roll cut side up in center of each  pan. Arrange remaining rolls in a circle of 6 around the center roll. Cover  and let rise until doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown.  Cool in pans 10 minutes. Invert onto wire racks, then invert again to cool.    Icing: In medium bowl whisk all ingredients until smooth. Drizzle over  cooled rolls. (Can be made ahead. Wrap well and freeze up to 1 month. Thaw,  wrapped, at room temperature.) Makes 14 rolls.
