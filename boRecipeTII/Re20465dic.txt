As to lasagne, I have a fantastic vegan recipe that I have adapted from a  vege moussaka recipe. I have tried it both with a white cheese sauce and a  tofu sauce and found both are nice. Hope you like it, Jan.    Soak and cook lentils. Drain. Add lentils, tomatoes, paste, garlic and  herbs to saucepan and cook 10 minutes until hot. Layer alternately with  lasagne sheets, finishing with lentil mixture on top. Mash silken tofu in a  bowl and add paprika to taste. Spoon over lasagne. Top with bread crumbs.  Bake in oven at 350-400 for about 30 minutes. Being ovo-lacto, I usually  top this recipe with a white sauce with paprika and a little low-fat  parmesan cheese.    My non-veg, high-fat-loving husband had a taste last time I made it and  said hed even eat it. :)  Posted to fatfree digest by Robyn Frankland <r.frankland@mailbox.uq.edu.au>  on May 21, 1998
