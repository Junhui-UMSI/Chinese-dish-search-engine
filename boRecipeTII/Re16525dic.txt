Being from Africa, I couldnt resist this traditional recipe, and herewith  pass it on, especially to those of you up north, who are in need of good  hot food! We are living on salads with temps soaring to       35    deg C and above!    ** Parsnips may be substituted for the kohlrabi.    Combine all the ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the  heat, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.    If you wish, cook the couscous seperately and serve the stew with it. Also  good served with mashed potato, brown or wild rice, small shell noodles  etc.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #292 by "Frances Watts" <fran@netheads.co.za>  on Dec 12, 1997
