Trim the artichokes down to their hearts (they can be quartered) ad set  them in a bowl of water acidulated with the lemon juice as you work. Use a  pan large enough to hold all the artichokes in a single layer. Add water  just to cover and add the lemon peel, onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme,  tarragon, and parsley.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer,  adding small amounts of water as needed, until the artichokes are tender  and just a few tablespoons of liquid remain.    Remove the bay leaf, lemon, parsley, and thyme branches.  Transfer the  artichokes to a food paocessor and puree, adding the remaining pan juices  as needed to thin the mixture.  If any fibers from the artichokes remain,  pass the puree through a food mill.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Add a little lemon juice or vinegar to sharpen the flavors (again, do this  to taste - the puree may already be fine as it is). Heap into a bowl and  garnish with the chopped chervil or tarragon.    *Note*  Artichokes make a subtle and delicate spread to serve with  crackers.  The time to make this is whenthe large spring artichokes from  California are available and inexpensive.  If its available, garnish the  spread with chopped chervil or tarragon.
