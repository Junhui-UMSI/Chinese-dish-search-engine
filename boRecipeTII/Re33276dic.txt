Basic Roquefort Dressing
Salad oil, Lemon juice, Worcestershire Sauce, Roquefort (or Blue) cheese, Vinegar, 
Mash cheese with a little oil. Add Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice,  vinegar and balance of oil. Shake well until creamy. There are lots of  recipes, but this is my personal favorite. Enjoy.
