Sift together flour, salt, baking soda, and sugar.  Add Persimmon Pulp to  the flour mixture along with remaining ingredients.  Mix well.  Turn batter  into a well-greased lightly floured baking dish (8x8x2 inches).  Bake in  preheated moderate oven (350) for 50 minutes, or until pudding is done.  Serve warm with whipped cream, hard sauce, or lemon sauce.  Makes 6  servings.    Persimmon Pulp: Choose only ripe fruit with a transparent skin.  Only ripe  fruit is sweet; unripe persimmons have an acid taste and pucker the mouth.  Peel and strain pulp.  Or mash, removing seeds.  If the pulp is not used  immediately, stir 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice into each 2 cups pulp, to  prevent discoloration.
