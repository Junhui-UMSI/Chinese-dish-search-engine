Preheat oven to 375f. In a large skillet heat oil over medium heat.  Saute onion, pepper and celery until onion is translucent; stirring  occasionally about 5-7 minutes. Add garlic, rice, kielbasa and ham.  Stirring frequently, cook 2-3 minutes to coat rice with oil. Add  remaining ingredients; heat to a boil, pour into a 9x12" baking pan.  Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Bake 18-20 minutes, or until rice  is tender and liquid is absorbed. Let sir for 10 minutes before  serving.    To prepare ahead: After baking, let cool and refrigerate overnight.  Cover and warm in a preheated 35F. oven for 30 minutes or until  heated through.
