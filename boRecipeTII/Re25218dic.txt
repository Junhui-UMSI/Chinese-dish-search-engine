Tombstone Brownies
TOMBSTONE BROWNIES, 
13 x 9 pan of brownies.  Frost with your favorite chocolate frostings. Then  take pieces of Hershey bars ( I like to use two pieces that are still  together) & write RIP on the back of the piece with white decorating icing.  Press into the end of the brownie to make the tombstone. Cut the brownies  into 4 x 2" pieces.    Recipe By     : Vonlisa    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
