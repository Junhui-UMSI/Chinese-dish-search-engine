Black Beans and Rice Salad, a Fatfree Variation
brown rice, Ground coriander, orange peel, DRESSING, Ground cumin, Fresh cilantro, fresh cilantro, Italian salad dressing; fat-free, Cinnamon, Salt and ground black pepper, GARNISH, SALAD, black beans , Cider vinegar, Celery, scallions, Orange juice, Chopped fresh parsley, 
Variation from the original: I substituted fatfree Italian salad dressing  for the olive oil and eliminated the spanish olives and the roasted walnut  garnish.    In a mixing bowl, combine the drained beans with the rice, and celery. In a  small bowl, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients. Pour the  dressing over the beans and rice mixture, and stir thoroughly.    Top with the cilantro or parsley.
