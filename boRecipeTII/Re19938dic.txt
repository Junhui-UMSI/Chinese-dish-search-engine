Cut the butter into small pieces; cut it into the flour  mixture, using a pastry blender, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Cut the bread into 1-inch-square pieces. Soak the raisins in boiling water  to cover for about 5 minutes, until plump, the drain them. Combine the  bread, raisins, and sliced apples in a bowl. Sprinkle the bottom of the  prepared baking dish with 3/4 cup of the flour mixture, add the apple  mixture, and top with the remaining flour mixture. Bake, uncovered, in the  preheated oven until the top of the brown betty is crisp and golden and the  apples are tender, 35 to 45 minutes. To make the rum whipped cream: In a  chilled medium bowl, beat the cream and sugar until stiff. Beat in the rum.  Serve the betty warm, with the rum whipped cream. Serves 6.
