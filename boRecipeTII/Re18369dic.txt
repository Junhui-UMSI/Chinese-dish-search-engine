Very Easy Cranberry Relish
Naval Orange, unpeeled, Bag (12 ounces) fresh, Sugar, (depending on taste), Grand Marnier or Triple Sec,, 
Chop the cranberries, (can be right out of the freezer) with the orange,  (include the peel)  until chopped fine. I do this in two batches. Add the  sugar and the liquor, both actually to taste. Thats it. Can be frozen or  not as desired.    This is also very good in lieu of pineapples for a basic upside down cake.
