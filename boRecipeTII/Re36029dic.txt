Beef Not and Broccoli
Cornstarch, Light soy sauce, Chopped scallions (white, Garlic powder, Sized onion; cut into chunks, Fresh ground pepper, Fresh grated ginger, Beef Not Strips, Vegetable broth (separated), Broccoli florets, Onion powder, 
Mix beef not strips and 1 1/4 cup of vegetable broth in a microwavable  bowl. Heat for 12 minutes. Let it sit while you prepare the broccoli &  onions.    Mix the corn starch, onion & garlic powder, and soy sauce into one cup of  vegetable broth. Stir well. Set aside.    Heat 1/4 cup of broth in a wok or large skillet. Stir "fry" the beef not  for about 5 minutes. Add the broccoli and onions. Stir fry for another  minute. Add the broth mixture. Cook and stir for another two or three  minutes. Add the scallions, pepper and ginger and cook no longer than one  more minute. Serve hot over rice. Delicious! It took me about 25 minutes to  prepare this wonderful dish! It probably tastes great the next day, too,  but there were no left overs.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #205 by <garcia5@un.org> on Sep 09, 97
