Piemento Cheese
Velveeta cheese, Black Pepper, Chopped piemento (4oz jars), Mayonnaise, Ground red pepper, 
Drain piementos. Grate Velveeta cheese into a large bowl. Add piementos,  black pepper and red pepper to mayonnayse and mix well. Add mayonnaise  mixture to grated Velveeta cheese and mix well. Let sit at room temp for  about a half hour Store in refrigerator in a sealed jar NOTES: Try it with  Velveeta first...  Then substitute if you must.. I find that the velveeta  gives a better consistency... Also, I recommend hand-grating... Food  processors tend to liquify. Sometimes I substitute 1 tsp ground mustard for  the red pepper... (Yup, Im strange...) Its great on crackers or in  sandwiches...  Also a great topping for burgers... And it keeps for -at  least- a month in the fridge!!!
