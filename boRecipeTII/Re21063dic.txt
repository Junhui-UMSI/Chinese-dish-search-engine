1. Heat oven to 450. Halve the squash lengthwise, and remove the seeds and  fibers. Sprinkle squash halves with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and pepper.  Fill a roasting pan with 1/4 inch of water. Place squash in pan, cover with  foil and bake until tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven, transfer to  a cool surface and let cool enough to handle.
