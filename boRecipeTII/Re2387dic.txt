source: The Spice and Spirit Cookbook (The Complete Kosher Jewish Cookbook)  ~Lubavitch Women    **NOTE:    1)I prepare this the night before, letting the rising step take place  overnight.    2)When using an electrical mixer, make in 2 batches, as youll burn out the  motor of the mixer, if you do it all at once.........Im talking from  experience!!!!    Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Then add sugar, salt and half  of the flour. Mix well. Add eggs and oil, then slowly stir in the rest of  flour........dough will become quite thick. When dough begins to pull away  from sides of bowl, turn onto floured board, and knead for 10  minutes.........[this I do in the mixer, with the dough hook.]    Add only enough flour to make dough manageable. Knead until dough is smooth  and elastic, & springs back when pressed lightly. Place dough in a large  oiled bowl. Turn so top is oiled as well. Cover with a damp towel, and let  rise in a warm place......[I put mine in the garage, where its warm in  Summer........and in the laundry room in Winter, while the dryer is  running, or has been all day.] Let rise 2 hours, and punch down every 20  minutes or so..........[I leave it overnight, no punching till the next  morning.] Separate challah with a blessing.........for details, e-mail me  privately, Ill let you know what to do/say.    Divide dough into 4 to 6 parts, and shape into loaves; place in well  greased bread pans or on greased baking sheet. Let rise until double in  bulk.    Preheat oven to 375deg.F.    Brush tops of loaves with beaten egg and sprinkle with poppy or sesame  seeds. Bake 30 to 45 minutes or until browned.    ***You can also add 2 teaspoons vanilla to dough before kneading.    ***Also, raisins can be added at this step.......before kneading.    ****Personal note: I have tried many, many different challah recipes, and  this one is, without a doubt, the best tasting, easiest one of all!
