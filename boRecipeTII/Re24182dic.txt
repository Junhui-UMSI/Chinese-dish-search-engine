Here is a recipe that I adapted out of Southern Living Magazine several  years ago. One cookie is a great breakfast or snack and is gram per gram  lower in fat and calories than commercial granola bars. I like to mix up a  whole batch then bake 6 at a time, freezing the rest of the dough for later  use.    Beat butter and peanut butter until fluffy; gradually add sugars, beating  well. Add eggs and vanilla, mixing well. Combine oats, baking soda, and  optional milk solids; add to peanut butter mixture, mixing well. Divide  into 24 balls and place on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly. Bake  at 350F for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown throughout (will still  look somewhat uncooked when hot).
