Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and set the rack to the middle, or just  above middle of the oven. Coat a 9 by 13 inch pan with non-stick spray. Mix  the cake mix, evaporated milk, and margarine together until cake mix is  moistened. Put 1/2 of the cake mixture evenly across the bottom of the 9 by  13 pan and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven allow it to  cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the baked cake  and pour the caramel sauce in drizzles across the chocolate chips. Do not  try to spread the caramel sauce. If the caramel sauce is too thick, warm it  in the microwave or a pan of hot water to thin it out. Pat spoonfuls of the  remaining cake dough into patties and place them across the top of the  caramel, as island of cake. Bake an additional 15 minutes or until the cake  is cooked.
