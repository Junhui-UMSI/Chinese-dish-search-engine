Brush oil on all sides of the  zucchini/squash. Grill until tender, turning occasionally. Transfer to a  plate and set aside. Puree the basil, garlic, vinegar, and mustard in a  food processor. Add the remaining oil to the mixture as it processes. After  a thick dressing is formed, season lightly with salt and pepper. Place the  sliced tomatoes on a serving platter. Cut zucchini/squash into 1-1/2 inch  pieces. Mix the zucchini/squash with 3/4 cup dressing. Spoon onto platter.  Drizzle remaining dressing over tomatoes.
