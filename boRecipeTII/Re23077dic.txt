Boil potatoes whole with quartered turnips, which take longer.    Heat 2 cups cream and 3 T. butter and mash the potatoes and turnips  together, adding the cream/butter mixture a little at a time until it is  creamy. Different potatoes absorb moisture differently so you have to stop  adding liquid at the consistency you like. Season with salt and white  pepper, and add the truffle oil a drizzle at a time until the truffle aroma  permeates the mixture.    Slowly saute the mushrooms in equal parts butter and olive oil (usually  about 2 T. each). Add the stock and the reconstituted Porcine. You can use  the broth from the soaking of the dried mushrooms also but be careful to  add it in slowly and not use the dredges, which can be sandy. Heat through.    To serve spoon a helping of the potato/turnips in the middle of a heated  soup bowl. Surround with the mushroom broth. Top with shavings of Parmesan  and, if its in the budget, dainty sliced truffles.    "Suddenly the table was lulled into silence by the smells emanating from  the soup bowls in front of them. Enough sliced truffles to choke a horse  were sitting on top of a mound of potato puree infused with truffle oil.  Around the potatoes a broth laden with wild mushrooms floated like a moat.  Curls of Quality Parmesan cheese topped the dish. "And they called this  mere potato soup" on the menu. Soup by Todd English, Boston.    TIP: you can do without the truffles, but you need to spring for the  smallest bottle of truffle oil you can find.
