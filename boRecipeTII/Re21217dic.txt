Pieces veal leg, about 1-1/2, Italian parsley, finely, Pancetta, cubed, 16 pieces, Unsalted butter, Prosciutto, thinly sliced, 8, Sage leaves, 
Pound veal pieces to 1/4-inch thickness and lay out on work surface. Place  one prosciutto slice over each. Place 2 sage leaves on each and divide  parsley among all 8 pieces. Roll each piece up and make two rows of 4  horizontally. Use 4 skewers to make a tress with each skewer piercing 4  rolls. Place 1 cube of Pancetta at the end of each skewer and push so that  the meat is pushed tightly together from both ends.    In a 10 to 12-inch saute pan, heat butter over medium heat until foam  subsides. Saute skewer sets 10 minutes, turning several times. Remove, cut  along parallel lines with skewers and serve hot with lemon wedges and  polenta taragna.
