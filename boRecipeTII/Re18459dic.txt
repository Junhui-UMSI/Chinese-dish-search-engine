Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    Season the beef brisket well with salt and pepper.

Heat a large saute pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat  for 2 to 3 minutes until the pan is nearly smoking. Add the beef to the hot  pan and sear well on one side until browned before turning the beef over  and searing the other side. When the beef has been well browned on both  sides, remove from the pan and set aside.    Add the onions to the saute pan and cook them until golden brown.

Continue to slowly brais e the beef  brisket for 1 1/2 to 2 additional hours.    Remove the pan from the oven, discard the celery bouquet and allow the beef  to rest for 20 minutes before slicing and serving with some of the onion  jus.    >From Michaels Place Show #ML1A30    Recipe by: Michael Lomonaco Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #550 by "Master  Harper Gaellon" <gaellon@inch.com> on Apr 4, 1997
