This is true magic.  Its called making food that you will like, out of  leftovers you would otherwise toss out.  This recipe is spawned off of one  popular in the depression era.  The trick is to toss everything you have  about to be no longer usable, into the crockpot and then cover with water  and slowcook it for 12 hours on low.    This one also takes well to the addition of leftover ribs, or just the  leftover rib bones for flavoring.    Nutritional information:  Low fat, low sodium (pending on additions made),  sugar-free.    Serve with a small portion of smoked salmon salad on stone ground wheat  crackers and a glass of iced tea.
