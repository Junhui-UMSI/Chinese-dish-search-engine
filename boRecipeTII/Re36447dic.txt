Beer Number 17
Maltose, Cascade hops (finish), Cascade hops (boil), Yeast, Plain light malt extract, Cultured Sierra Nevada, 
The  maltose is a cheap rice-malt mix obtainable from oriental  markets.  Boil malt, hops, and maltose in 2-1/2 gallons of cold water. In last   2  minutes,  add the finishing hops. The yeast was cultured from a   bottle of  Sierra Nevada pale ale. By the next day, the yeast did not  seem  to start,  so I added a packet of Vierrka lager yeast. Rack  to   secondary after one  week. After another week, prime with 3/4 cup corn  sugar  and bottle. Color  similar to any American lager. Tastes much better,  very  mellow. The goal  was to brew 5 gallons of beer while only spending  $10.  This came to about  $11. Im not sure what drives me to such frugalness,  but having grown up  with American beer, sometimes I would rather  have   it with certain foods,  like pizza.
