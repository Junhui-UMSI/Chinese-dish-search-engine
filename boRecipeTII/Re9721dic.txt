*** SHORT PASTRY CRUST ***   Sift the flour and salt together into a large bowl. With 2 knives or a  pastry blender, cut in the butter and shortening until mixture is the  texture of coarse crumbs. Add only enough water to make a soft dough. Form  into a ball, wrap in wax paper and chill for at least 1 hour.   *** PIE ***   1. Roll the crust dough on a lightly floured surface to a 1/8" thickness  and place in the bottom of a 10" pie pan. Trim and flute the edges.   2. Preheat the oven to 450. Combine the pumpkin, honey, molasses and  spices in a food processor and process until well blended. With the  processor on, add eggs one at a time, processing a few seconds after each  addition. Transfer to a large bowl.   3. Beat the cream in a large bowl until doubled in volume. Fold into the  pumpkin mixture. Pour into prepared pie shell and bake 10 minutes. Reduce  the heat to 350 and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes  out clean, about 40 minutes longer. Arrange cranberries in a circle on top  of pie.
