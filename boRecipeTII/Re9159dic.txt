Provencale Potato Ragout with Green Olives
Baking potatoes; cubed and, olive oil, Pepper, Thinly sliced onion, Salt, Garlic, Water, Green olives; sliced, Bay Leaves, Seeded tomato; coarsely, Thyme sprigs, 
A ragout (ra-GOO) is a well-seasoned stew-like dish; this one, unlike most,  is meatless. When cooked, the potatoes should be so soft that they fall  apart; this helps thicken the dish.    Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skilled over medium-high heat. Add  onion, and saute 10 minutes or until soft, stirring frequently. Add tomato;  cook 10 minutes or until the liquid almost evaporates, stirring frequently.  Add potato and next 6 ingredients (potato through bay leaves); bring to  boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 40 minutes or until potato is tender,  stirring occasionally. Stir in olives; cook an additional 5 minutes.  Discard thyme and bay leaves. Yield: 6 servings (serving size: about 3/4  cup).
