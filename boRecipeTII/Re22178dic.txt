When the above is nearly golden add 1 very large grated carrot. When the  grated carrot gets soft add 1 lb ground turkey. When the turkey is half  browned, grated about a 1/4 toa 1/2 tsp of nutmeg over the meat, add salt  to taste. Add 6-8 fresh ripe tomatoes (just wash them and throw them in,  after they burst fish out the skins.) Simmer about 20 minutes, add tomatoe  sauce or white wine if you need more liquid but in Italy we like our Ragu  a little dry rather than soupy.
