Als Chocolate To the Max
Whipping cream, Package of semisweet, Vanilla, Egg, Creme de cacao liqueur, Almond extract, Chocolate chips, 
Blend together first 4 ingredients while microwaving the cream until just  beginning to boil. With blender going add the hot cream and blend until  well combined. Pour into small sherbet or wine glasses (I use the  disposable plastic ones) and refrigerate for several hours. This is  chocolate to the MAX! Few people refuse one of these and few can eat more  than one.
