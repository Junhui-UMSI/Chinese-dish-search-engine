Bake 14 to 16 minutes, or until a  wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool 10  minutes, then remove from the muffin pans and place on cooling racks. Allow  to cool completely, the freeze cupcakes 2 hours, or until firm.    Meanwhile, to make colored coconut, add 2 to 3 drops food color to 1 cup  coconut and mix well.    Frost top and side of each cupcake with frosting. Sprinkle generously with  colored coconut, completely covering the frosting.
