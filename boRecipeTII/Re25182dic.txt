*My addition.    Cut tomatoes in cubes; drain in colander for several minutes.    Meanwhile, in 10 or 11" frying pan over high heat (I used 10" pan), melt  margarine.  Add mushrooms and cook, stirring, until they are soft and  juices have evaporated. Add tomatoes; stir to heat through.    With spoon, make 6 to 8 nest spaces; break an egg into each space. Sprinkle  with salt and pepper; cover evenly with cheese.    Cover pan; cook on low heat until eggs are set as you like (took 20 to 30  minutes).  Garnish with parsley and thyme.
