Chile Rellenos Pt 2
See part 1, 
3/4 inches deep and heat over a medium flame until moderately hot. Dip the  cheese stuffed peppers in the batter one at a time and place them gently in  the oil. Cook on one side until golden brown while basting the top with a  spatula. Turn and repeat the process on the other side. When cooked on both  sides, remove and drain on paper towels. To serve, cover with sauce and  serve while hot ! ( When cooking, brown the side without the cut first. As  you baste the top this will help keep the cheese in.)    The Sauce: Saute the onions and garlic in a small amount of olive oil until  crispy tender. Do not brown. Add the tomatoes and mash them with a fork.  Add all the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and  cook partially covered for about 30 minutes or until reduced by about 1/4.  Correct the seasonings if needed. Thicken with a little cornstarch mixed  with some chicken broth or water to the consistency of a smooth gravy.  Makes about 3 cups of sauce.    NOTES : Note - Any cheese or stuffing or combination may be used with these  chiles in this manner. Chicken, ground meat, vegetables and etc. You are  limited only by the confines of your imagination.    I have seen some cooks dust the chile with flour just before dipping it in  the batter. If the chile is dry I have not found this to be necessary to  get the batter to adhere to the chile.    In my opinion the sauce is as important as the chile and I like it  thickened a little so it clings to the relleno. Too many restaurants serve  it the consistancy of water.
