Info:  from "Eat More, Weigh Less", by Dean Ornish M.D., 1993 Harper  Collins recipe by Wolfgang Puck typed for you by Perry Lowell, GOURMET,  July 93 The length of time it takes for the ketchup to thicken depends on  the water content of the tomatos, so be patient. Make only with  vine-ripened tomatos.    Makes 2 cups.    In a medium stainless-steep or enamel saucepan, over a low flame, cook the  tomatos and garlic until the sauce begins to bubble. Add the onion and red  pepper and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the corn syrup, vinegar, salt, and  pickling spices and continue to simmer over the low flame until the sauce  reduces and thickens, about 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. (The sauce  will reduce by about one-half.)  Do not rush.  Cook over a low flame to  prevent scorching.    Strain through a food mill and stir in the tomato paste. Correct seasoning  to taste, cool, and refrigerate in a covered container until needed. The  ketchup will thicken slightly as it cools, but it is not the consistency of  store-bought ketchup.  The ketchup will keep up to three weeks.    Serving Size:       2 Tablespoons Calories: 52 Fat: .3 grams Cholesterol: 0  Sodium:             448.4 milligrams
