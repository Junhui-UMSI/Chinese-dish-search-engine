Cinnabons (Cinnamon Buns)
BUNS, Loaf bread dough, FRUIT MIX, Apple sauce, Cinnamon, Brown sugar, TOPPING, cream cheese, Sugar, Vanilla, 
* (frozen, from your machine or whatever)    ** (You can double for gooier buns)    *** (or sub yoghurt cheese or even yoghurt but sauce wil be softer but not  really a problem)    Mix fruit, cinnamon and sugar if using. (I often leave it out and rely on  alternative sweetner in the topping.) Roll dough out into large rectangle.  Spread with fruit mixture. Roll up and slice into buns. Place buns into a  nonstick pan and let rise. Sprinkle lightly with brown sugar and bake at  350 until done. Make topping by mixing fatfree cream cheese (or sub) with  sweetner of choice and 1 t vanilla (more if you are a vanilla nut), Frost  with the topping (or if it is too runny use as a dip) and enjoy.
