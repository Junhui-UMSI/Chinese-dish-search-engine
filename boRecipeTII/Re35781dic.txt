Stuffed Cucumber Slices
Cream Cheese, Blue Cheese, Grated Onion, Dried Dill Weed, Cucumber, Fresh Parsley, 
Score cucumber by pressing tines of a fork about 1/16" into peel at one end  and pulling tines lengthwise, leaving grooves. Turn cucumber and continue  scoring until entirely covered with lengthwise grooves. Trim ends; cut  cucumber in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop seeds from inside  cucumber and discard seeds. Let cucumber halves drain, cut side down, on  paper towels about 10 minutes. Combine cream cheese, blue cheese, onion,  parsley and dill weed in a small bowl. Spoon mixture into hollowed-out  cucumber. Slice crosswise into 1/2" wide slices. Serve immediately.
