1. Generously brush a heavy 10 x 2-inch round cake pan or 10-inch  springform pan with olive oil or cooking oil. I use the same dark round  (almost black) baking pan as they use in the restaurants, it gives a much better crust.      2. In large mixer bowl, sprinkle yeast into warm water. Stir till dissolved. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the flour; the 1/3 cup oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Beat at low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat for 2 minutes  at high speed, scraping bowl often. Stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can.      3. Cover, let rise in warm place till double. Punch down. Let rest 5 minutes.      4. Turn dough into pan. Using oiled hands, spread dough evenly over bottom and partially up sides of pan. Cover; let rise till nearly double, about 30  minutes.      5. Arrange cheese slices in 1/4-inch thick layer on dough. Gently press sausage on cheese. Using hands, gently crush tomatoes into small pieces atop sausage. Sprinkle with herbs and Parmesan (I use Pecorino Romano).     6. Bake in a 500(F) degree oven for about 25 to 30 minutes or till edges of  the crust are crisp and golden brown. If desired, sprinkle the pizza with  sliced mushrooms or chopped green pepper during the last few minutes of  baking time. let the pizza stand 5 to 10 minutes before cutting.
