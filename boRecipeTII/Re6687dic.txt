Polenta with Chipotles and Sun-Dried Tomatoes
Salt, Garlic, Water, Dried chipotle chile pepper, Sun-dried tomatoes, Polenta or cornmeal, 
Bring water and salt to a boil over medium-high heat in a heavy saucepan.  Pour polenta in slowly, in a thin stream, stirring constantly. Add garlic  and cook polenta, continuing to stir constantly, until it starts pulling  away from the sides of the pan.    Meanwhile, reconstitute tomatoes and chipotles by pouring boiling water  over both and let sit while polenta cooks. After polenta is fully cooked,  drain, mince softened tomatoes and chipotle and add to mixture.    Sprinkle drops of cold water over marble pastry board or cookie sheet. With  firm spatula, spread cooked polenta onto board into a rectangle 1/4-inch  thick. Let cool and cut into shapes with cookie cutters.    Place shapes on cookie sheet sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. Broil  4-inches from heat source for 5 minutes and serve immediately.
