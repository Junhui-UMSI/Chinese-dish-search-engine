Spice up a meal with this simple, but delicious recipe from The Eating Well  Rush Hour Cookbook by the editors of Eating Well Magazine (Thomas Allen &  Son, $22.95 paperback).    1. Preheat oven to 450F. Slice tops off onions and peel, leaving root ends.  Cut each onion into 8 wedges, taking care to slice through the root so the  wedges stay intact.    2. Place the onions in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish and toss  with oil. Spread them out in a single layer. Pour vinegar over the onions  and sprinkle with salt. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes or  until almost tender. Uncover and bake for 5 to 10 minutes more or until the  onions are soft and caramelized on the bottom. Serves 4.    from the Toronto Sun Living Section    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Leslie Duncan <duncan@VIANET.ON.CA> on Jan  14, 1998
