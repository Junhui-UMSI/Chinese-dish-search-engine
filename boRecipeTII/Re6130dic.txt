PREPARATION OF DOUGH: 1. Sprinkle the yeast and half the sugar on the warm  water in a small bowl. Stir until yeast dissolves. Let stand until mixture  is dubbly. 2. Put most of the flour and the salt into a medium bowl. Stir  in the yeast mixture and oil and keep stirring until a smooth soft dough  forms. 3. Knead on a floured surface, using as much of the remaining flour  as necessary to form a stiff elastic dough. Place dough in a large greased  bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (30 to 45  minutes) and not sticky. While the dough is rising, prepare your topping  sauce. 4. Punch down dough. Knead briefly on lightly floured surface to  distribute air bubbles; let dough rest 5 minutes longer. 5. Flatten dough  into circle on lightly floured surface. Roll out from center towards edges  to form a flat round, then place in a greased 12-inch pizza pan. Sprinkel  dough with extra virgin olive oil. 6. Pour preferred topping over pizza  dough and bake in oven preheated to 220C(450F) until golden brown (about 20  minutes). Cut into wedges and serve.
