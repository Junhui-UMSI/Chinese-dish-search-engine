Pumpkin-Black Walnut Biscuits
Finely chopped black walnuts, Baking soda, Unbleached all purpose flour, Ground cinnamon, Salt, Ground allspice, Grated nutmeg, Sugar, Canned or mashed cooked, Buttermilk, or a bit more if, Butter, cold, Baking Powder, 
Sugar    "A batch of these intriguingly flavored biscuits is a nice addition to any  meal. This particular biscuit has a tendency to overbrown on the bottom, so  use a light-colored metal baking sheet instead of a nonstick sheet. Serve  the biscuits hot with butter."    Preheat oven to 450 F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder and  soda, salt, and spices into a large bowl. Cut in the butter (or use food  processor) until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the nuts. In a  small bowl, whisk together the pumpkin and buttermilk. Add it to the flour  mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be quite stiff and not all the  flour will be incorporated. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured cloth  and knead gently a few times to work in the rest of the flour. Roll out the  dough to a 1/2 inch thickness and cut with a 2 inch round cutter. Transfer  the biscuits to a lightly oiled shiny baking sheet, and sprinkle tops with  sugar. Bake for 10 minutes--do not let them get too brown. Serve  immediately with butter.  If you must have jelly with the, choose a  delicate apple jelly so the subtle pumpkin flavor is not masked.    From: Cooking From Quilt Country Shared By: Pat Stockett
