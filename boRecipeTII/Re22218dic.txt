(Found in a Prevention Magazine from January 1984)    Combine stock, cornmeal, thyme, marjoram, basil, coriander and paprika in a  4 quart, heavy bottomed saucepan. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer,  stirring constantly, until mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan.    Remove from heat. Add lemon juice, onion and turkey.    Turn scrapple out into two 8x4 inch loaf pans that have been rinsed with  cold water. Refrigerate until firm.    To serve, slice scrapple into 1/4 inch slices, dip in flour and saute in  oil until brown on both sides. Makes 2 loaves. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest  by WINCATS@aol.com on Apr 23, 1997
