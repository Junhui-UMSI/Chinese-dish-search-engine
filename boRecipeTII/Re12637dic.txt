Rub them between your hands to remove as  much of the papery skin as possible. Grind the nuts finely in a food  processor or nut grinder.    Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan. Raise the oven to 350 degrees.  Sift flour with baking soda, baking powder and salt.    Beat egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the sugar in electric mixer until pale and  very thick. Mix in the yogurt and then the olive oil. Fold in flour and  nuts.    Beat egg whites with cream of tartar to soft peaks. Add remaining 1/2 cup  sugar and beat to firm peaks. Whites should look shiny, not dry and  granular. Gently fold egg whites into the batter. Pour into the pan. Bake  until cake pulls away from side of pan, about 55 minutes. Cool on a rack.
