Melt shortening with cocoa (I use the microwave), cool.  Beat eggs,  gradually adding sugar.  Add shortening mixture, Amaretto, salt, and flour.  Beat until well mixed.  Pour batter into a lightly greased 13x9x2" baking  pan.  Bake at 400F for 20 minutes; cool. Frost with Amaretto Frosting,  sprinkle with sliced almonds (or arrange in flowery patterns to be fancy).  Cut into squares.    ************************** Amaretto Frosting *****************************      Melt butter and cocoa together (the microwave works well for this),  cool.
