Stir  occasionally, until the mixture comes to a full boil. Let it boil for 7  minutes.  Turn the heat off and let the syrup cool for 15 minutes.  Add the  maple flavoring and stir. When completely cool, transfer the syrup to a  covered plastic or glass container. Makes:  1 quart    Note:  For a syrup with a butter flavor, just add 3 Tbsp.  of butter to the  mixture before heating.  For a lighter syrup, use a sugar substitute  instead of the sugar. The absence of natural maple syrup in this recipe is  not unusual. In fact, there is no real maple syrup in any Aunt Jemima  syrups.    From: "Top Secret Recipes" Cookbook.
