Banana Bonanza Bread
Vanilla, Quite ripe bananas; (good, All-purpose flour, Sugar, Cinnamon to taste, Baking Powder, 
yes, those are all of the ingredients! Heres how ya do it!    Peel the bananas and mash in a large bowl with the sugar and vanilla. This  will turn to a thick, fragrant glop (a technical term) in a few minutes.  Stir in the flour and baking soda a bit at a time, until its all  incorporated. Pour this mixture into a glass dish (just about anything  should work, weve done it in a loaf pan too and it works great) and  sprinkle some cinnamon on the top. Bake in a 350 over for 50 min - 1 hr.  Now, this bread is not the texture of the familiar banana bread, which i  think has more the consistency of a muffin or cake. This will actually have  the texture of a chewy, dense bread!    Posted to fatfree digest by pat94@total.net (Pat & Tina) on Apr 3, 1998
