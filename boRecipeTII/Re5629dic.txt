Streusel: combine brown sugar and granulated sugar in a small bowl. Add  flour and mix to combine. Add butter and work in with fingertips until  mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Refrigerate in airtight container until  ready to use.    Galette: preheat oven to 400. Cut pineapple slices in half and place on  paper towel to absorb juice. Arrange pineapple slices over pastry in  concentric circles, overlapping them slightly, leaving 1 inch border around  edge. Fold pastry edge over edges of pineapple slices all around the  galette. Sprinkle streusel over top. Bake 40-45 minutes or until crust is  golden brown. Remove from oven and brush warm apricot glaze over pineapple  slices and serve lukewarm cut into slices. *A store bought pie shell works  fine for this recipe or make your own pastry with flour and butter ( 2 cups  flour to 1 stick of butter). Use ice water until it make a pastry ball.
