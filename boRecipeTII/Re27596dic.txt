The Best Hamantaschen in the World
Sugar, Baking Powder, Eggs, Vegetable oil, Seedless orange, Flour, Jam or other fillings, 
Cut the orange into quarters and pulverize it in your food processor until  finely chopped. Add the eggs, sugar and oil, and process for about 10  seconds. Add the baking powder and flour and process with several on/off  turns, just until the flour is blended into dough. It will be slightly  sticky, but thats OK. Cut the dough into 3 or 4 pieces, and work with just  one lump at a time.    Roll the dough out on a well-floured board to about 1/8 inch thickness.  Using a cookie cutter (or a glass, like Im sure Auntie Rivka would have  done) cut 3-inch circles of dough. In the middle of each circle, put about  1/2 teaspoon of filling: jam, chocolate chips, or even canned pie filling.  Pinch the sides of the circle up, making a triangular enclosure, and  leaving the top slightly open so that you can see the filling. Just make  sure that the corners are firmly pinched so that the jam doesnt leak out  the sides.    Makes about 4 dozen delicious hamantaschen.
