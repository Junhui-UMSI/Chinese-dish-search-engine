This  recipe for an omelet filling calls for a little cheese but I have made and  enjoyed this many times without putting in any cheese.  This recipe was  originally posted by Anita Matejka.    Cook bacon in a large skillet.  Then, drain on paper towel and crumble.  Heat skillet again and add oil.  Then, add potatoes, onions, and bacon  again. Cook until onions are tender. Put parsley in and stir for a couple  of seconds. Lower heat. Cover and keep warm while you make your omelets.  This makes enough filling for two omelets. Spoon filling onto omelets and  sprinkle with cheddar cheese just before folding (if you are using cheese.)    EAT-L DIGEST 9 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
