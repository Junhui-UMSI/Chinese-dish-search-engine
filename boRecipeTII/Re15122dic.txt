In a heavy saucepan, boil the presoaked wheat, covered, for 1 hour in the  water used for soaking. Add more water as the kernels cook, if necessary.  Melt the suet or lard in a lrge heavy pot over medium-high heat. Remove the  rendered suet pieces, add the onions to the pot, and cook until they are  translucent. Combine the beef with the ground chile, garlic, oregano,  cumin, and salt to taste. Add this beef-and-spice mixture to the pot with  the onions. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally,  until the meat is evenly browned. Stir in the caribe, green chiles, tomato  paste, and tomato juice. Drain the wheat, reserving the liquid, and stir in  the kernels. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered, for  1 hour. If the chili begins to get too dry, add some of the liquid the  wheat was cooked in. Taste and adjust seasonings.
