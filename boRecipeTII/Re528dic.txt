Fresh Corn and Sundried Tomato Salsa
Fresh corn kernels, Sundried tomatoes, Shitaki, Hatch chiles, Cilantro, Marjoram; fresh, Sherry vinegar, Fresh Lemon Juice, Fresh lime juice, garlic, Kosher salt, Virgin olive oil, Typed by Manny Rothstein, 
Toss all ingredients together. Cover and place the salsa in the  refridgerator. Allow at least one hour before serving to let the flavors  blend and develop.    Goes well with halibut, salmon, tuna, swordfish, pork and poultry. Add 1/2  cup cooked black beans for a heartier version. This salsa goes very nicely  with tacos and if the black beans are pureed, it even makes a great dip!    Makes about 4 cups, serves 6-8.    Recipe from Chef Leavitt of Walts Wharf, a seafood restaurant in Seal  Beach, Ca. (9/93)    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 19, 98
