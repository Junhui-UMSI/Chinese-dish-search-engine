When you have ripe tomatoes in your garden or       can find       them at the market, take time to make several batches of this       sauce. The       recipe doubles well and the sauce freezes beautifully. You will       pat yourself       on the back in the middle of winter when you open a freezer       container and       find the sweet taste of vine-ripened tomatoes inside. I thank       cookbook author       marcella hazan, whose tomato sauce recipe inspired this one.
