Basic Sourdough Starter
Water, Flour, Sugar, Commercial buttermilk, 
Sourdough starters can be purchased commercially or they can be started  on your own. Your own might be more fun. One cup of water is mixed with 1  tablespoon sugar, 1 cup flour, and 4 tablespoons commercial buttermilk. Mix  all of this together and place it in a glass or stainless-steel bowl. Do  not use aluminum. Cover this with a towel and allow to stand in a warm  place for a few days, or until it has begun to ferment and has a wonderful  sour smell. You might keep this on the top of the water heater or in your  oven and leave the light on all the time. The starter should be the  consistency of pancake batter and it can be covered and stored in the  refrigerator. Use this as your starter in any of the recipes that follow.      The old-timers claim that you can get a sourdough starter going by just  mixing flour and water together and allowing it to sit in a warm place for  several days. This may work, but it is not terribly reliable.      HINT: ON STORING SOURDOUGH STARTER. When storing sourdough starter in the  refrigerator, remember that it should be kept at around 42?. If it is too  cold, it will take a long time to come around again, to come back to life.  Your refrigerator is probably colder than this, so perhaps you may want to  store the starter in a very cool place.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
