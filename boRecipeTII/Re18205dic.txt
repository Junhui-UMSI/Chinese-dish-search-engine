Trim venison of any connective tissue and cut into 2-inch by 1-inch cubes.  Place marinade ingredients into a 6-quart pot and bring to a boil. Allow  marinade to cool and submerge venison pieces. Allow to stand covered in  refrigerator overnight.    Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with towels, reserving marinade. In a  heavy-bottomed Dutch oven, heat lard until smoking. Season venison with  salt and pepper and place 4 to 5 pieces in pan and sear until deep golden  brown all over. Remove to side plate and repeat until all meat is done. Add  flour and speck to pan and bring to boil. Add cinnamon, cloves, remaining  marinade and meat, including juices exuded on to plate, and bring to a  boil. Lower heat to simmer and cook slowly for 1-1/4 hours, or until meat  is very tender. Remove from heat, stir in sour cream, check for seasoning  and serve immediately with roasted turnips.
