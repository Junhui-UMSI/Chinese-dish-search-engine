Garlic, Butter, Soft bread crumbs, Smoked salmon, Sharp cheddar cheese, Cream cheese, Eggs, Tomato, 
Butter casseroles (custard cups work well). Press 2 to 3 tsp. bread crumbs  on bottom and sides of each. Blend remaining crumbs with 1 T. butter,  reserve. Break an egg into each dish. Mash garlic with cream cheese and  gently place over eggs. Add smoked salmon, folding long strips as needed.  Sprinkle grated cheddar over the salmon. Put 1 fat tomato slice (from  middle of the tomato) on each dish (dice the rest for saled). Crumble half  of the bread crumbs over each dish and bake in 350 oven for 8 to 15 minutes  (depending on how you enjoy your eggs), then broil for 2 to 3 minutes,  until tops are browned and slightly crisp. Serve at once.    Suggested Wine: Chablis or dry gewurtztraminer    Serving Ideas : hot rolls, asparagus or steamed artichokes, green salad    NOTES : this is delicious at any meal    Recipe by: Eight Items or Less - Ann Lovejoy    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by KSBAUM <KSBAUM@aol.com> on Mar 29, 1998
