Rub butter into flour.    Heat sugar and honey gently until well mixed, stir in baking powder.    Add to flour mixture, alternating with egg yolks beaten with milk.    Mix very well, add salt and mix again.    Roll out very lightly on floured board, cut into rounds or shapes.    Put on greased baking sheet, bake in oven 350F (180=F8C), about 20 minutes.    Remove to a rack, paint tops with lightly beaten egg white.    Mix thick honey with ground almonds, spread over painted tops.    Put in very cool oven for no longer than 5 minutes to set.    Eat either hot or cold, or    Serve hot from oven with warm, melted honey poured over.    Makes about 24 cakes.    NOTES : Heather honey is famous for its flavour, gathered from the tiny,  delicate, wild flowers which are also used for making Heather Ale, Drambuie  and Atholl Brose. It takes a lot of heather blooms to make anything, so  heather honey is a particular treat, as are these light little cakes.
