Layered Dip
(large) Chopped Olives, (14 oz) Salsa, Cheddar Cheese, (30 oz) Refried beans, Onions, Avocado, Lemon juice, Ground meat, Taco seasoning mix, (4 oz) Green chiles, Mayonnaise, Sour cream, Taco seasoning mix, 
Fluff beans with fork or whip, just enough so that it isnt packed  together right out of the can. Mix together Avocado and lemon juice OR buy  prepared guacamole. Cook ground meat with taco seasoning. Mix together  mayonnaise, sour cream, and taco seasoning.    Layer together in a 13x9x2 pan, (in order of ingredients) 1. beans 2.  onions 3. guacamole 4. meat 5. chiles 6. mayo/sour cream mix 7. olives 8.  salsa 9. cheese    The idea is to get one layer of soft ingredients, then one layer of  hard ingredients, so that they will blend together nicely.    NOTES : Store bought refrigerated salsa is best.    Recipe by: Vamori Kaufman    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #387 by Trinette Kaufman  <trinette@corecom.net> on Jan 24, 1997.
