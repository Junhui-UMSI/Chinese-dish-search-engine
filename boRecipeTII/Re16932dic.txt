Theyre from an article by Jacqueline Mallorca in the Chron. For  those to whom it is important, shes working on a book about wheat-free  baking. No hint as to the release date though.    Preheat oven to 350F. Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.    Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and  grind until a fine meal is formed++the flour will prevent the nuts from  turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt and 2  teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.    Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2-cup measuring  cup.  With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed  tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix. Transfer  batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds, and bake for  55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices best after several  hours, or the next day).    Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).
