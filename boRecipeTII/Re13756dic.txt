Cook rice as package directs, disolving 3 tsp boullion in water before  adding rice.  In a medium skillet cook celery & pepper untilnearly done.  Disolve remaining boullion in the cup of hot water.  In a large bowl  combine rice, vegetables, boullion liquid, stuffing mix and poultry  seasoning. Mix well and stuff bird.
