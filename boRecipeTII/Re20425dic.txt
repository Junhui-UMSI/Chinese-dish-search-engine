Vegan Low Fat Sweet Potato Soup
white pepper, Coarsely chopped onions, Tabasco sauce, vegetable broth, ground cilantro, Sweet potato, Ground cumin, Salt to taste, 
Options include canned hominy, raisins, or shredded apples which are added  at the end of the cooking time.    The soup is made in a microwave. The times are based on the full setting of  a 700 watt oven. Adjust accordingly if necessary. Use a bowl large enough  to contain all ingredients. I use a large bread bowl which can be used in  the microwave.    1. Cook potato for 15 minutes.    2. Add onions and cook for additional 15 minutes or until onions are soft.    3. Puree vegetables with a cup or so of broth in the a food processor.    4. Return puree and rest of the broth and all of the spices and seasonings  to the bowl and cook for 45 minutes, then salt to taste and adjust spices.  cooking times may vary so you should basically cook it until it is thick  and creamy.    5. If you use any of the optional ingredients, add them during the last  20-25 minutes.    This soup freezes very well. It actually tastes better the second day. I  find that it sometimes gets very thick so I add a bit of water before I  reheat it. It would make an excellent sauce over some exotic pasta. Dress  it up for company with a sprig of cilantro and some shredded carrot.    This recipe is not fussy. Sizes of potatoes and onions can vary. It doesnt  seem to have any effect on how the soup turns out. You just can mess this  recipe up. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #140 by Mezzatesta@aol.com on Jul  5, 1997
