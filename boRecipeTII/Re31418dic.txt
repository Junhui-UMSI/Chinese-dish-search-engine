Barbecue Brisket
Brisket, Liquid Barbecue Smoke?, Worcestershire Sauce, Prepared barbeque sauce, Garlic salt, 
Pierce brisket all over with meat fork.  Sprinkle Adolphs meat tenderizer  on both sides of meat.  Let stand one hour at room temperature.  Sprinkle  on garlic salt.  Place meat in baking dish or zip lock bag.  Pour 2-4 oz.  liquid smoke over meat (depending on how big brisket is).  Cover and  refrigerate overnight.  Turn over in the morning.  Five to eight hours  before serving add 5 tablespoons Worchestershire sauce.  Cook covered in a  225? oven.  The last hour of cooking, pour about (9 oz) one half bottle of  barbecue sauce (Kraft original or your favorite kind) over meat.  If  desired the sauce can be thickened with a little cornstarch-water paste.  Slice thin and serve.  The meat will not burn, but it will become tender  and fall apart the longer it cooks.  Enjoy the smell while its cooking and  the compliments when you serve it!  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #176    Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 00:01:46 -0600    From: Shirley Jordan <shirleyj@pacificrim.net>
