The  secret is the long slow cooking..A Texas trick with a Jewish flavor..    First..rub the Brown sugar all over the meat..then onion soup mix,sprinkle  the remaining ingredients ending with the paprika..Cover tightly with foil,  Bake at 300 for 2 hours, loosen foil a bit and bake for 5 more hours at  250..cool for 1 hour before slicing..serve with hot degreased pan juices.  serves 6    JEWISH-FOOD digest 298    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
