Penne Allarrabiata
Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Snipped w/scissors, In juice OR, Fresh flat-leaf parsley --, Peeled Italian plum tomatoes, Can, Dried Italian pasta -- (such, Crushed tomatoes -- in, Can, Plump fresh garlic cloves --, Crushed red peppers flakes, Handful, Or to taste, Sea salt, Minced, Puree, As penne), 
1. In an unheated frying pan large enough to hold the pasta later on,  combine the oil, garlic, crushed red peppers and a pinch of salt, stirring  to coat with the oil. Cook over moderate heat until the garlic turns golden  but does not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. If using whole canned tomatoes, place a  food mill over the pan and puree the tomatoes directly into it.    Crushed tomatoes can be added straight from the can. Stir to blend and  simmer, uncovered, until the sauce begins to thicken, about 15 mins, taste  for seasoning.    2. Meanwhile, in a large pot bring 10 1/2 pts (6 litres) of water to a  rolling boil. Add 3 Tbs salt and the penne, stirring to prevent the pasta  from sticking. Cook until tender, but firm to the bite. Drain thoroughly.    3. Add the drained pasta to the frying pan with the tomato sauce. Toss,  cover, and let rest over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the pasta to  absorb the sauce. Add the parsley and toss again. Transfer to warmed  shallow soup bowls and serve immediately.
