Crust:  Blend together the graham crumbs and the almonds, add the butter  and combine mixture well. Press the mixture onto the bottom and two thirds  up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan.    Filling:  In a double boiler melt the chocolate, stirring until it is  smooth, and remove the bowl from the heat. In a large bowl with an electric  mixer beat the cream cheese until it is light and fluffy; add the sugar and  beat in the whole eggs and egg yolks, 1 at a time and beating well after  each addition.  Beat in the flour and the vanilla, and add the melted  chocolate in a slow stream, beating until the filling is well combined.    Scatter the raspberries over the bottom of the crust, pour filling over  them, and bake the cheesecake in the middle of a preheated 250F oven for 1  hour, or until top is firm to the touch. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan  on a rack; chill, covered loosely, overnight. Remove side of pan to serve.    Gourmet Magazine December 1992
