Yellow food coloring, Cottage cheese, Onion soup mix, milk, 
....makes about 2 cups    This recipe was sent in to us by Cindy Brunell of Franklin, Mass. Thanks  Cindy, it sounds...well..  like it looks pretty disgusting. Perfect!    In a small bowl, mix the cottage cheese, onion soup mix and milk.  Stir in  some food coloring until you get the desired yellowish color.  Do not  over-mix!  Lumpy is more realistic!  Arrange your vegetables or crackers on  a platter surrounding the Vomit Dip.
