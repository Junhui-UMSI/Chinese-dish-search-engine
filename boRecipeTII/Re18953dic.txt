Angel Hair Pasta with Whipped Cream and Porcini
Fresh mushrooms, chopped, Angel hair pasta, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, (1 cup) whipping cream, Chopped shallots, Dried porcini mushrooms *, 
Place the porcini in a small bowl and and 1/2 cup warm water.   Allow to  soak 45 minutes.  Drain, reserving the liquid.  Heat a large frying pan.  Add the oil and shallots, and saute a minute.  Add the fresh mushrooms and  saute until tender.  Chop the porcini coarsely and add to the frying pan,  along with the reserved liquid.  Simmer until most of the liquid is  evaporated.    Bring a large pot of water to a boil along with a pinch of salt.  In a  separate bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks.  Refrigerate the  whipped cream until the pasta is cooked.  Cook the pasta in the boiling  water until al dente.  Drain well, return the drained pasta to the pot and  add the mushroom mixture, cheese, whipped cream and salt and pepper to  taste.    Using a large spatula, fold all of the ingredients together.  Do this  quickly, yet carefully, so that the whipped cream doesnt collapse  entirely.  You may want to save a bit of the whipped cream to dollop on top  of the pasta as a garnish.    Serve immediately.    * Or other dried mushrooms    Source:  Frugal Gourmet Celebrates Christmas Typed by Dale/Gail Shipp    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
