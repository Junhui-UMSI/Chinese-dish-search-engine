"In 1966 a chocolate cake called the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, made with a  boxed frosting mix, won the Pillsbury BAKE-OFF Contest.  Although the  frosting mix was discontinued, Pillsbury continued to receive so many  requests for the cake that the company developed a scratch recipe to  simulate the original. Here it is:"    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 12-cup bundt pan or 10"  angel food tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a large  bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium  speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a  time, beating well after each addition. Gradually add 2 cups powdered  sugar, beating until well blended. By hand, stir in flour, 3/4 cup  cocoa, and nuts; mix until well blended. Spoon batter into prepared  pan and spread evenly. 3. Bake 58 to 62 minutes. Since this cake has  a soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary doneness test cannot be used.  Accurate oven temperature and baking time are critical. Let cake cool  upright in pan on a rack for 1 hour; then invert onto serving plate  and let cool completely. 4. To make glaze, in a small bowl, combine  remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa, and milk.  Mix until well blended. Spoon glaze over top of cool cake, allowing  some to run down sides. Store cake tightly covered.    ** Nuts are essential for the success of this recipe.
