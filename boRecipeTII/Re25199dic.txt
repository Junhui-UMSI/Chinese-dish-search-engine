Tomatoes Stuffed with Orzo and Vegetables
Vegetable oil, Green onions; sliced, Salt, Thinly sliced fresh basil, Pepper, Uncooked orzo, Chicken broth, Red bell pepper; chopped, Grated parmesan cheese 4, 
Saute orzo in hot oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until golden  (about 5 minutes). Add broth; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and  simmer 20 minutes or until orzo is tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir in  basil and next 4 ingredients.    Cover and chill. Stir Parmesan cheese into orzo mixture. Cut tomatoes to  resemble petals, cutting to, but not through bottoms. Spoon orzo mixture  into tomatoes. Makes 4 servings.    Notes: Browning orzo, a tiny rice-shaped pasta, gives a nutty, crunchy  texture to this dish.
