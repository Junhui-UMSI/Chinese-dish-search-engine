From a box of Swans Down cake flour.  Sift flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt and sift together three times.   Cream butter thoroughly, add sugar gradually, and cream together until light and fluffy.   Add flour, alternately with milk, a small amount at a time, beating after each addition until smooth.   Add vanilla.   Beat egg whites until they hold up in soft peaks.  Stir quickly but thoroughly into batter.   Bake in two greased 9 inch layer pans at 375F for 25 to 30 minutes.    Spread Lady Baltimore Filling between layers and Lady Baltimore Frosting over tops and sides.    Lady Baltimore Frosting and Filling:  Combine egg whites, sugar, water and corn syrup in top of double boiler, beating with a whisk until thoroughly mixed.  Place over rapidly boiling water, beat constantly with whisk and cook 7 minutes, or until frosting will stand in peaks.  Remove from boiling water, add flavoring and beat until thick enough to spread.  For filling,  scald figs and raisins and chop.  Add enough frosting to chopped fruit and nuts to make a filling that will spread easily.   Spread between layers.  Spread remaining frosting on top and sides of cake.   While frosting is soft, sprinkle top of cake with chopped cherries and additional chopped figs, raisins and nuts.
