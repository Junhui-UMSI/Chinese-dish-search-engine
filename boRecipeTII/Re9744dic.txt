Hi! This is from this months Weight Watchers magazine. IMHO its a little  too sweet for breakfast, but makes a great dessert! It has a wonderful  custardy top layer.    Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan; add rice, lemon rind and  cinnamon stick. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes or until  rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat; let stand,  covered, 10 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick.    Preheat oven to 325 F.    Combine pumpkin and next 6 ingredients in a large bowl; stir well with a  whisk. Stir in rice mixture and raisins. Pour mixture into a 2 1/2 quart  casserole coated with cooking spray. Bake at 325 F for 15 minutes, and stir  well. Bake an additional 15 minutes, and stir well. Bake 1 hour and 10  minutes (do not stir) or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Serve warm, or chilled. Yield: 6 servings.
