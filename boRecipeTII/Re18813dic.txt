From: hz225wu@unidui.uni-duisburg.de (Micaela Pantke) (COLLECTION)    Date: Thu, 22 Jul 93 11:12:07 +0200  The following recipes are taken from an old Roman cookbook MARCUS GAVIUS  APICIUS: DE RE COQUINARIA.  The book I have is edited and translated from  Latin by Robert Maier.  My humble person only translated the German  translations into English.  I hope the recipes are still rather near to the  originals.  First I have to introduce you to some native Roman ingredients,  such as:    ~- Caroenum: Boiled must (you have to boil the new wine or grape juice  until it is only half the amount you started with).    ~- Defritum: Either thick fig syrup, or must thats boiled until you have  only a third of the amount with which you started.    ~- Liebstoeckl: I didnt find an English translation.  In Latin its called  levisticum officinale.  Its an umbelliferous plant with yellowish  flowers. Its dried roots are used as spice. It seems to be a kind of  celery.    ~- Liquamen: a salty fish sauce. Most of the time you can replace it by  salt.    ~- Passum: Very sweet wine sauce, made by boiling the must (new wine or  grape juice) to thicken it. (maybe add honey? - just my guess)    ~- Poleiminze: A kind of mint thats growing in inundated areas. Just  replace it by ordinary mint.    ~- Saturei: I didnt find an English translation.  In Latin its called  satureia hortensis.  Its a violet or white flowered kind of labiate  plants which grows mainly in Southern Europe. Its used as a spice plant,  especially for bean dishes.    ~- Silphium: Its other names are Laser or ferula asa foetida.  Ive  noticed that its also called hing in the Indian cuisine.  It is an onion  and garlic substitute and should be used rather sparingly because of its  very strong taste and smell.
