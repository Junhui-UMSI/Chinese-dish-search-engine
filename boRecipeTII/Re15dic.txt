Jan Zepps Hot Chocolate Mix
Powdered coffee creamer, Powdered sugar, Enough dry milk to make 10 pints, 
The following recipes and tips were in an article in the Food Day section  of the Oregonian. They are from Marnie Swedberg, author of "Marnies  Kitchen Shortcuts."      Combine dry milk, Nestles Quick, creamer and sugar. Store in sealed  plastic container.    To use: Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of mix to 1 cup hot water.      Tips:      * Store homemade mixes in airtight, moisture-proof containers or in  resealable freezer bags. Swedberg prefers sour cream and cottage cheese  containers; for large batches, she uses ice cream buckets and deli  containers.      * Mixes containing shortening or bread crumbs will stay fresh for six  months. Spice mixes will stay fresh longer, but tastes and aromas may  decline with age. Freezing extends shelf life.      * An empty shoe box works well as a "filing cabinet" for plastic freezer  bags filled with dry mixes.      * Label mixes as you prepare them. Include the name of the mix, date  assembled and use instructions. Try self-adhesive labels or a small square  of paper taped to the container.      * Assembly will go more quickly if you use two sets of measuring utensils:  one for dry ingredients and the other for shortening.
