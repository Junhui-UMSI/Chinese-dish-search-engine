1. Bring 4 qts of lightly salted water to a rolling boil in a large pot.  Cook the macaroni until al dente, about 8 min. Drain the macaroni in a  colander, rinse with cold water to cool, and drain well. Preheat the oven  to 400 F.    2. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick  saute pan. Add the onion, garlic, and peppers and cook over medium heat  until the vegetables are soft and aromatic, but not brown, about 4 min.  Stir in the flour and cook for 1 min more. Stir in the skim milk and bring  to a boil, stirring steadily. Simmer the sauce until thickened, about 1  min. Stir in the cheese, dill, mustard, salt and pepper, cayenne and nutmeg  to taste. The sauce should be highly seasoned.    3. Stir the macaroni into the sauce. Spoon the mixture into a 8x12-inch  baking dish which has been lightly sprayed with oil. Sprinkle the top with  bread crumbs. Bake the macaroni and cheese until bubbling, crusty, and  golden brown, 30-40 min.
