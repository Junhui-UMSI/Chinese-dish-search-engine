Pefect Pancake Batter
Salt, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Milk, Butter, Flour, Sugar, Egg, 
Put dry ingredients in a deep, narrow bowl: 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon  sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking  soda. Then quickly stir in the wet ingredients: 1 cup milk (more if its  buttermilk or if the batters too thick), 1 egg and 1 to 4 tablespoons  melted butter.    The secret of pancakes is "dont stir too much." The batter gives off  carbon dioxide, which makes pancakes light and airy. But if you overwork  the batter, the CO2 dissipates, and your pancakes become hockey pucks.  Pancake batter has to be thick enough to cook through and thick enough to  hold the CO2 bubbles. Using a deep, narrow bowl provides optimum conditions  for holding bubbles. For maximum bubble power he says, rest the batter 20  to 30 minutes before cooking.    One last thing: Resist the urge to prepare pancakes for a group. Pancakes  have to be eaten right off the griddle.

(Its usually found in the  baking isle by powdered milks. This way, Im not throwing away have the  carton of buttermilk.) Its a powder, one container is equivalent to 3.75  quarts liquid buttermilk. All you do is add water to it. Directions are on  the container for conversion for buttermilk or sour milk. This must be  refreigerated after opening for maximum shelf life. This is also great for  any recipe(s) requiring buttermilk or sour milk.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 663 by QueenBerta@aol.com on Jan  31, 1998
