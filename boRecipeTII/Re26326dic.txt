Tomato Angel Hair Pasta with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat
Fresh parsley, Fresh tomato angel hair pasta, Butter, tomato, fresh, Fresh garlic, Fresh jumbo lump crabmeat, Fresh basil, 
Important to the success of this dish is the use of very fresh ingredients.  This dish must be served as soon as it has been prepared. It doesnt wait!  Keep a boiling pot of water with strainer ready as you begin the sauce  preparation. Add butter to saute pan with garlic and basil leaves. Slightly  brown the garlic as the basil leaves wilt. Add the tomato concasse (with  the natural juice) and bring to a boil. At this point, place the tomato  angel hair in strainer, then into the boiling water. Add chopped parsley  and crabmeat to the tomato concasse mixture. Heat the crabmeat thoroughly  in the sauce, but do not shred the lumps of the crabmeat with overmixing.  Fresh tomato angel hair pasta will require 90 seconds in the boiling water  to cook. Remove and shake excess water from pasta.    To assemble: Place pasta in bowl and pour sauce with crabmeat over the  pasta. Garnish with fresh sprig of basil and serve at once.
