Yorkshire Parkin (Oatmeal Gingerbread) (Rev

Parkin is a variety of gingerbread, good warming stuff to eat out of doors  in cold weather. When I was a child, it was always a firm favourite for the  firework party on Bonfire Night each year. This is adapted from my mothers  recipe.    Method:    Prepare 2 1-lb loaf tins, or an 9x9 inch square tin, by spraying with Pam.  Set the oven at 350 deg F (gas mark 4).    In a large bowl, mix together the oatmeal, flour, baking powder, ginger,  and salt. In a small bowl or saucepan, mix together the apple sauce, sugar,  treacle, syrup, and milk, and warm slightly to dissolve the sugar. Add  these to the oatmeal mixture along with the egg white, and mix together to  make a soft mixture of a slow-pouring consistency, adding extra milk if  necessary. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until the top springs back when  pressed lightly with a finger.    After it has cooled a bit, but before it gets cold, cut it into 2-inch  squares in the tin. Cool the pieces on a wire rack, and store them in an  airtight container.    It tastes better if it is stored for 2-3 days before eating.
