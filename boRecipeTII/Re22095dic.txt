Turkey in Red Chile
2-lb turkey hindquarter; or, olive oil, Blended red chile pods, 
This one sounds hot, and it is . . . but not in terms of spice power. The  dish is amazingly mild and very flavorful. This would be great in any  season of the year.      Brown the defrosted hindquarter in the oil, in a Dutch oven. Add the  sauce and simmer, covered, until tender, about 1 hour.      I like Rice with Cheese and Onions (see recipe) with this dish. A light  salad and very heavy, dry red wine would complete a nice menu.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
