Strawberry Orange Preserves
Nonstick cooking spray, Large and small whole, Thin-skinned orange;,, Sugar, 
Spray inside of pot with nonstick cooking spray. Wash and hull berries.  Remove all small berries and set aside. Crush or mash remaining berries  coarsely in a food processor or by hand (hand method is messier but best).  Grind the orange in a food processor until it is a fine paste. Combine  reserved whole berries with crushed berries and pureed orange and mix well.    Place fruit and sugar in pot and stir over medium-low heat to melt sugar  and incorporate into fruit. As sugar dissolves, increase heat to  medium-high and simmer jam until foam forms. Remove foam with slotted  spoon. Continue cooking until jam tests done, 20 to 25 minutes (220  degrees). Ladle into hot sterilized jars to within 1/8 inch of jar top.  Wipe rims, remove air bubbles with a sterilized knife and place lids on  top. Process boiling water bath for       15    min.    NOTES : (Makes approximately 7 to 9 half-pint jars) This can easily become  your trademark jam and is a good choice for novice jam-makers.
