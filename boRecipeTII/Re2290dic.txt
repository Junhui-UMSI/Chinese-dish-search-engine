Recipe by: The Bread Machine Cookbook V - ISBN 1-55867-093-9 After both  doughs are finished, remove the first from the refrigerator and the second  from the machine. Roll both into equal, thin rectangles, the width equal to  the length of the loaf pan. Sprinkle one of the doughs with cinnamon and  place the other dough on top. Roll the two rectangles together in a jelly  roll fashion. Place in a medium to large loaf pan and let rise for about 30  mins. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 35 mins or until golden brown.    NOTES : Make both bread on the dough cycle (put the first in the         refrigerator after it is done and while the other one is in the         machine.) Use fully ripe bananas for the best moisture. Adjust         moisture consistency if necessary. If your dough cycle has a         raisin beep, add the nuts then. If not, add the nuts about 10 mins         after starting the machine. If desired, a glaze of confectioners         sugar, vanilla extract and milk may be drizzled on top while still         warm.
