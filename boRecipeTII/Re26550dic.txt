Bacon-Wrapped Mushrooms
Bacon, Toothpicks, Fresh mushrooms, 
1. Cut the mushrooms in half. If it is a very small mushroom, leave it  whole. If it is an oversized mushroom, cut into thirds or fourths.    2. Slice bacon in half (width-wise) at an angle. To do this, hold the knife  perpendicular to the bacon, then turn the knife slightly so that the knife  is now at an angle, then slice the bacon.    3. Take a slice of bacon and wrap it around a mushroom half, overlap the  ends, and poke a toothpick about half-way into the mushroom at the overlap.    4. Repeat this for each bacon slice and mushroom half.    5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    6. Arrange mushrooms on a drip pan about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 20  minutes. Serve hot.    NOTES: Depending on how thick the bacon is, you may need more than 1 pound.  Also, dont let soak mushrooms in water or theyll absorb too much water  and then theyll shrink and crack.
