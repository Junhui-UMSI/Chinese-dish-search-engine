Yogurt
Yogurt, milk, 
You can use yogurt in so many other recipes (besides eating it just to have  yogurt) that its worthwhile to have around.  You can make your own really  easily, too.  All you do is heat up some milk until its just short of  boiling, let it cool to 110 degrees, throw in 2 Tbsp to 1/4 cup of yogurt,  pour it into a glass or ceramic bowl, cover it, and let it sit until it  becomes yogurt, about 7-10 hours.  (If youve got a gas oven with a pilot,  this is the perfect place for it.)  If you want to make it cheap, you can  even make it with reconstituted powdered milk (or half real milk and half  powdered) and if you want a thicker nonfat yogurt, just add extra milk  powder to the liquid.    * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJs BBS for Homemakers!
