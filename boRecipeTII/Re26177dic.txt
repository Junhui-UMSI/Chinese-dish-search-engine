Tom Ka Gai (Chicken and Coconut Milk Soup)
juice and peel of 1 lime, Hot chile peppers, Cilantro, Chicken breast, Galanga, lemon grass, coconut milk, 
* Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,  (though Ive used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation Ill describe below).    Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you dont want the whole  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.    When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for  garnish.    Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds. We also served it  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who  cares, it was wonderful.  If you cant find grouper, itd be good with any  tender, delicate white fish ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or  maybe little chunks of monkfish. I believe Ive had this with shrimp as  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. Ive seen it in one Asian  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so Id guess that  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)    Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you cant find it at Tin Tin or  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)    2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; Ive had it so hot that I could  barely eat it, and Ive had it completely smooth, sweet and mild. I like it  in the middle.    3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can  tell it isnt edible unless you puree it.  (If theres sufficient demand,  Ill print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the  slices of lemon grass and ginger.    From: megatest!sfisher@uu2.psi.com (Scott Fisher)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
