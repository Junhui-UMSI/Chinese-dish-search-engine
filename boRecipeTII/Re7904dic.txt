In a food processor, process the chocolate wafers into crumbs. Add the  melted butter; combine. Press the crumb mixture into 9-inch round, 3-inch  deep springform pan, reserving 1-1/2 cups of the crumb mixture.    Bake in a preheated, 325 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and  allow to cool.    When the crust is cool, fill with the frozen yogurt. Sprinkle with half of  the reserved crumb mixture. Dribble half the fudge sauce over the crumb  layer, then place in the freezer so the yogurt wont melt.    After 5 minutes, make a second layer with the raspberry ice. Sprinkle the  remaining crumb mixture on top. Put in freezer immediantly.    Serve with the remaining fudge sauce and whipped cream, if desired.    TO MAKE THE FUDGE SAUCE:  In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, cocoa  powder, milk, corn syrup, and butter. Bring to a boil and let boil 2 to 3  minutes.  Remove from the heat. Whisk in vanilla extract. Recipe: Post Oak  Grill, 1415 S. Post Oak Lane, Houston, Texas
