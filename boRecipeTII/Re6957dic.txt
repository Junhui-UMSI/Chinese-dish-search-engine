Knead with hand into a not so soft dough. If the dough  becomes too soft, rolling the pooris will be difficult. Also, they may not  puff up properly.    Divide the dough into 1 inch balls and roll each one out into flat thin  pitas about 3.5 inch in diameter. Deep fry in medium hot oil.  The instant  you release a poori into the hot oil, it should puff up in about 5-6  seconds. Then, turn in upside down to fry the other face. Donot let it get  brown. If oil is too hot, poori will get browned on the outside but may  remain doughy on the inside. So, adjust the oil temperature accordingly    Its easier to make pooris if two persons are doing it. One can roll out the  pooris and the other can fry them simulataneously. Otherwise, you may have  to roll out all atonce,keep each covered under a damp cloth (otherwise they  will become dry on the surface) and then deep fry each one.
