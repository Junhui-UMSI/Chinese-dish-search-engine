Add butter and mix until "corn meal" like.  Add eggs and beat.  Add currents.    Roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into 2 inch circles.  Lightly  grease a frying pan.  Cook approximately 2 min. or each side.  They should  be light brown but moist on the sides. Serve warm.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
