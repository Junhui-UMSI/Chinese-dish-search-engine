In a stockpot, melt the butter over low heat, add the onion, and  gently saute until soft and translucent (do not brown). Add the potatoes,  cream, half & half, bouillon cubes, milk, salt and pepper. Simmer over low  heat until thickened and thoroughly heated, about 30 mins. If you like a  thicker soup, add a little cornstarch or flour, dissolved in a small amount  of liquid.
