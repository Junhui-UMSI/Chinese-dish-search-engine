Heat a skillet over moderate heat, add sausage and cook until browned.  Remove sausage and drain on paper toweling. Discard all but 1 tablespoons  of fat. Add onion to fat in skillet and cook slowly until soft but not  browned. Add garlic and cook a minute or two more. Add red and yellow bell  peppers and toss to coat with oil. Add tomatoes, wine, Worcestershire and  seasonings. Cook at a simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, for about 10  minutes, adding sausage pieces toward the end of that period. Uncover and  cook over high heat to reduce to desired consistency. In the meantime, cook  penne until al dente in ample boiling salted water. Drain pasta and toss in  a heated bowl with a tablespoon or so of good olive oil. Serve pasta in  heated bowls with sauce and a sprinkling of parsley.
