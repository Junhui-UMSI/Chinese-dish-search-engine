Quick and Easy (And Lethal) Beef Stir Fry
Steak, Green Bell Pepper, Carrot, Hot Red Chile Oil, Sesame seeds, 
Speakin of beef, this is quick and easy (and lethal if you have the right  kinda chile oil):    In a very hot cast iron frying pan or wok, heat the oil (Do NOT let it  smoke unless you have a fondness for tear gas), toss in the carrots, then  the peppers (carrots take a little longer but not much) then the beef.  Sprinkle the Sesame seeds, stir fry rapidly till the beef is browned and  then serve over rice.    Aside from the cutting and the rice (which you can do ahead of time), the  whole process takes about a minute and looks impressive when you do it in  an electric wok in the middle of the table. Little sprinkle of garlic  flavored Soy Sauce and a cold Kirin on the side. Yummy.
