Use light hand with garnish to get an intriguing and subtle touch.    In a deep saucepan or Dutch oven saute the garlic in oil over medium heat  until it starts to turn brown. (This will take only a few minutes.) Add  remaining ingredients, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer,  covered, about 10 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender. Taste  and adjust seasonings. Serve immediately or store for reheating later.  (Unlike may other soups, this one is not delicate, and reheats readily.)
