Hot German Potato Salad
Potatoes, Slices of bacon; diced, Vinegar, Water, Sugar, Dry mustard, Medium onion; chopped, Parsley, Salt, Black pepper, 
Boil the potatoes in their skins, then peel and slice them into a serving  bowl while still hot and steaming. Fry the bacon until crisp, remove from  skillet and set aside. Add to bacon drippings the vinegar, water, sugar,  mustard; bring to boil. Add the onion to the hot sauce for a very short  time, to gentle it while retaining most of its crispness. Add parsley, salt  and pepper to the potatoes, pour the sauce over them, and toss with a fork.  Serve hot or warm. (Or can be eaten cold, if you dont object to congealed  bacon fat!)
