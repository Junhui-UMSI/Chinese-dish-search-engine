Mix all rub ingredients. Mix mop ingredients. Sauce, spices and mop can be  prepared one week ahead.    tTrim pork of all excess fat. Rub with dry seasonings and chill for 2-6  hours. Place on grill over indirect heat. If possible maintain temperature  at 225-250 degrees. Cook until meat registers 170 degrees, turning  occasionally and mopping regularly. Transfer to pan and shred. Pour  drippings over pork. Serve on buns, topped with coleslaw and BBQ sauce.    Sauce: Melt butter. Add onion and saute approximately 3 minutes over medium  heat. Add remaining ingredients and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer  for approximately 30 minutes or until sauce is reduced to 2 2/3 cups.  Season to taste with salt and pepper    For coleslaw: Mix first 3 ingredients in large bowl. Add cabbage. Season  with salt and pepper. Prepare 1-2 days ahead for full flavor    NOTES : I I used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne.  Did not make the  BBQ sauce. Used KC Masterpiece, Honey Smoke. Made this for July 4th party  in 1996 and again by popular demand in 1997! SOOOOOO good!!
