From: MBrant1004 <MBrant1004@aol.com>    Also yesterday I made a taboule salad for the first time. It turned out  pretty good. I combined several recipes until I got the taste that I like.  For those of you who have not tried it, taboule is a Mediterranean dish,  made from wheat grain and is a very refreshing and healthy salad. I used  the coarser grain bulgur, #2. Here goes a posted version and my concoction.    After soaking bulgur, squeeze dry and place in a bowl with the mint,  parsley (I did not use) , tomato, and green onion. Stir the lemon juice,  salt (1/2 tsp) and garlic together and slowly beat in the oil. Stir in the  pepper, cinnamon and allspice. Pour the dressing over the salad; toss and  serve. Tastes better if you use fresh mint and allow to chill for 3 or 4  hours.    Posted to recipelu-digest by jeryder@juno.com on Mar 12, 1998
