Ramos Fizz
Gin, Ice Cubes -- cracked, Club Soda -- or to fill, Sweet Cream, Powdered sugar, Orange Juice -- * see note, Egg white, Fresh Lemon Juice, 
* Or orange flower water.    Fill a mixing glass with cracked ice. Add gin, cream, lemon juice, egg  white, powdered sugar and orange juice. Shake well and strain into a  chilled Collins glass. Top with club soda.    Not worth the risk of giving a customer saminilla from the raw egg and  getting sued!    Recipe By     : Boston Bartenders School of America
