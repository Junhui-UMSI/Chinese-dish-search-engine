The Famous Dutch Sticky Buns
Currants, Brown sugar, Salt, Cinnamon, Raisins, Milk, , Flour, Butter, Yeast, Water, 
Dissolve yeast in warm water and add to milk which has been allowed to  become lukewarm. Add sugar (about 3 Tbsp), salt and flour, and knead  thoroughly until it becomes a soft dough. Place the dough in a buttered  bowl and butter the top of the dough. Cover bowl and put in a warm place.  Permit it to stand until the dough becomes three times its original size.  Roll until it is one fourth of an inch in thickness, brush with butter and  spread with the raisins, currants, citron, brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll  as a jelly roll and cut into slices 3/4 inch thick. Place slices in  buttered pans, spread well with brown sugar, and bake at 400-F for 20  minutes.
