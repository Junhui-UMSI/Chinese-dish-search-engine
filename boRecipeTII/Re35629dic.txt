My husbands Aunt worked in Hawaii at Stuart Andersons Black Angus and she  gave us this recipe....I am not sure how original it is, she may have tried  to duplicate it.    In a saucepan, melt the butter and saute onion until transluscent, but not  brown. Add the flour to make a roux, and cook and stir for 5 minutes. In a  seperate bowl, combine the chicken stock, instant potatoes, salt, basil,  pepper and tobasco. Gradually add to the roux mixture, stirring and  bringing to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, stirring often.  Add the diced potatoes to the soup, continue to simmer 5-10 minutes,  stirring carefully without mashing the potatoes. Add cream as desired for  consistency. Garnish: Top individual bowls of soup with cheese, bacon, sour  cream and onions.    Note: You may use any toppings for garnish that you would normally put on  your baked potatoes. Also, the recipe is supposed to be for 4-6 servings,  but they wouldnt be very big. If you double it, it serves 4-6 generously.
