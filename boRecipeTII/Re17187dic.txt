Put flour, gluten and salt in mixing bowl. Mix applesauce and warm water  together and pour into flour mixture. Stir till all flour is absorbed into  liquid. Knead for about 10 times. Let rest for 20 minutes. Divide into 12  pieces. Roll out each one to about an 8 inch circle. Brown each side in a  preheated non-stick skillet. Heat should be set at medium low. Store in a  ziplock bag or use immediately.    If you want to use white flour, increase the amount by 1/2 cup and knead a  little longer.
