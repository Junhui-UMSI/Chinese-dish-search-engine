White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies
Baking soda, Granulated sugar, White Chocolate Chunks -- *, Egg, Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Macadamia Nuts -- ** see, Salt -- (I usually use, Note, Less), See note, Butter or margarine, Flour -- plus 2 Tb, 
* I buy large good quality candy bars, such as Lindt, and chop them up. **  I use straight from the jar, you may prefer to chop up    Preheat oven to 375 F Mix all dry ingredients together in a separate bowl  In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until fluffy. Add vanilla and  egg--mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter/sugar mixture--mix well  Add chocolate and nuts Spoon onto lightly greased cookie sheets (I use  cushionaire--no burning) Make whatever size you what--I tend to make them  large because it saves time Bake 8-12 minutes, depending on size of  cookies--they should not brown, more of a golden color Cool on rack    BTW:  I usually make a double batch of the dough, separate into halves, and  add regular chocolate chunks and pecans to one (and maybe some coconut),  white chocolate and macadamias to the other--two cookies with half the work    Recipe By     : "Leo, Debbie" <leodeb@HQ.
