The greens used in his homeland arent available here, but Reneth Mano  finds collard greens an excellent substitute.    Finely shred the greens, discarding tough stems. Place in a saucepan with  the water. Bring to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, just until greens  are crunchy-tender (dont overcook). Drain greens, reserving liquid. Return  greens to medium heat; add tomato and onions. Heat through, stirring  frequently.    Thin peanut butter with 3/4 cup of the reserved cooking liquid, then add to  vegetables. Heat, stirring constantly, until greens have a creamy  consistency, adding more reserved liquid if mixture seems too thick. Taste,  and add salt if needed.    Serves 4.
