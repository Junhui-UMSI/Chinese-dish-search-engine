Xmas Ale 1
Chocolate malt, Flaked barley, Crystal malt, Austrialian light extract, Brown sugar, Ale yeast, Stick cinnamon, Malt (liquid), Whole clove, Cascade (finishing), Northern brewer hops, 
Add  all the grain and malt into the water and boil. After it starts  to  boil,  add Northern brewer and spices. After about 45 minutes, turn  off  heat, add the Cascade. After 20 minutes, filter into carboy. Pitch yeast  when cool. Clarify and bottle in a week. I had a party and everyone liked  this brew (1 month aging.) It  has  a medium head, a pleasant hint of  spices (not strong but very  noticeable) and smooth taste.
