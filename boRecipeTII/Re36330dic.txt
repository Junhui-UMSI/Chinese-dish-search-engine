submitted by: vanny@iafrica.com (Myra in Capetown)  After moving to South Africa from the US, I wanted to try recipes from  local cooks. Here are two simple and easy Indian/Cape Malay recipes that  are favorites. Hope you enjoy.    *Mince in SA is ground beef in the US    Braise onion in oil until light brown. Add chopped tomato, masala, tumeric,  ginger, garlic, and salt. Let simmer until oil comes on top. Then add mince  or chicken, etc. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add potatos. (If using  beef chunks, let it cook for 30 minutes before adding potatos.) Let simmer  until potatos are tender, NOT MUSHY. They should be firm.    You can also put in par boiled cabbage, beans, or cauliflower.
