Cook bacon in 4-qt. pan over medium heat until mostly cooked. Set aside  about 2 Tbs. bacon bits for garnish. Drain off and discard drippings, all  but 2 Tbs. Add onion and vegetables to pan with bacon and reserved  drippings; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft (about 5 minutes). Add  potatoes, water, and beer, and cook about 15 minutes, or just until potato  is tender when pierced. Add sausage and corn; let come to a simmer, then  turn off heat and let sit until cool enough to put in fridge. Refrigerate  until about a half hour before you are ready to serve it. Reheat gently,  stirring often. When soup is hot, add half-and-half and let come to a bare  simmer; do not boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Optional: Garnish with parsley, grated cheese and additional bacon bits.  Makes 6 to 8 servings. Serve with homemade bread, and eat by candlelight.  :)    * Note: Try to find creamed corn that does not have added sugar. (Seems  like most canned creamed corn has sugar in it nowadays, so if you cant  find it without, dont worry about it. I usually add just a squeeze of  fresh lemon juice (1 to 2 tsp.) to cut the sweetness.)    P.S. Its called "Power Outage Corn Chowder" in honor of the first time  that I made it, when the lights went out just as we sat down to the table.  Just by coincidence, I had a candle on the table, so we lit it. It made a  rather plain meal into a festive occasion!
