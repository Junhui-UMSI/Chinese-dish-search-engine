Separate broccoli head into florets; peel  and stems, if using.    Preheat oven to 425?.    Rub the potatoes all over with the butter or margarine and bake in  preheated oven for one hour, pricking them several times with a fork AFTER  the first 30 minutes of baking.    Meanwhile, parboil the broccoli in a saucepan of boiling salted water for  about 4 minutes, or until just tender.  Drain in a colander and rinse with  cold running water.  Drain well again and chop coarsely.    At the end of the hour baking time, remove the baked potatoes from the  oven; when JUST cool enough to handle, cut a lengthwise slice from the top  of each potato.  Then cut an X in the pulp of each potato, cut around the  circumference; scoop the pulp from the skin, leaving a 1/2" shell. Force  the pulp through a ricer into a bowl .  Add the butter, milk, and salt and  pepper to taste.  Beat the mixture until fluffy, then stir in the broccoli.  Mound the filling into the potato shells.  At this point the stuffed  potatoes can be refrigerated, covered lightly, for up to 24 hours.    Bake the potatoes on a baking sheet in a preheated 425? for 10 - 15 minutes  (if they are freshly made) or 20 - 30 minutes (if they have been  refrigerated).
