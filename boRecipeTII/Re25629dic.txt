In small bowl, combine vinegar, mustard, catsup, paprika, salt and pepper.  Slowly add oil, beating constantly with electric mixer. Stir in celery and  onions. Pour sauce over shrimp. Marinate 4 to 5 hours in refrigerator.  Halve and peel avocados. Lift shrimp out of sauce and arrange on each  avocado half. Pass sauce. Good served with chilled asparagus, carrot  strips, sliced beets and hard-cooked eggs. This is a good luncheon dish and  also can be served with toothpicks as an appetizer. Mrs. Neel Garland.
