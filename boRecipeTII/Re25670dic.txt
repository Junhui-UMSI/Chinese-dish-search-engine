Split open the game hens from the breast side and flatten them out  into a butterfly shape.  Discard loose skin and fat.  Broil the hens  for 3 minutes on each side.    Process the shallots, garlic, coriander, chile, ginger, turmeric,  salt, lime juice and 1/2 cup of the coconut milk to a smooth sauce.  Marinate the hens in the sauce for 15 minutes.    Put the hens in a large skillet and cook over moderate heat for 10  minutes uncovered.  Then add the remaining coconut milk and the lemon  grass. Bring to a boil and cook for 30 minutes, basting occasionally,  until the hens are tender and almost all the liquid has evaporated.    Serve warm.    Serves 4.    San Francisco Chronicle, 3/9/88.
