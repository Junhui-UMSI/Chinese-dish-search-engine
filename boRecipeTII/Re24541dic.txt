Fish Paste: Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and reduce  to a paste. It should have the consistency of cookie dough. If it is not  dry enough, add more cornstarch.    Asparagus: Heat the oil to medium in a wok or other deep, heavy vessel.  Take 3 or 4 asparagus spears in one hand and about 2 or 3 tablespoons of  fish paste in the other. Wrap the fish paste around the middle of the  sheave to bind it together. Drop it into the hot oil and deep fry for about  3 minutes, or until the fish paste is set and just beginning to brown.  Remove and drain. Repeat, cooking three or four sheaves at a time. Combine  the remaining fish sauce and chile paste and drizzle over the cooked  sheaves.    Variation: To reduce calories, cook the sheaves in boiling clarified  chicken or fish stock. You could also use green beans, or bell peppers cut  into thin strips lengthwise.
