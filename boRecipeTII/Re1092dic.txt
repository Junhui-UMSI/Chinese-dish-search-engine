Corned Beef and Cabbage (4 Quart Cooker Version)
Corned Beef Brisket, Water, Carrots, Potatoes, Cabbage, Onions, 
The 6-8 quart version (which in their humorous jest says serves 8) doubles  almost everything...except 4 cups water, and says to use a medium Cabbage.    ** Bulk corned beef (3-4" thick) out of brine must be covered with cold  water several hours before cooking. Drain and cook with fresh water.    + Use toothpicks to hold together.    # Small or 2 medium cut in half.    Place corned beef in cooker. Add water. Cover, set control at 10 (lbs of  pressure) and cook for 60 minutes after control jiggles. Cool cooker for 5  minutes, then reduce pressure instantly. Add whole carrots, potatoes,  cabbage and onions. Cover, set control at 15 and cook for 8 minutes after  control jiggles. Reduce pressure instantly. Drain juices to get access to  veggies.    Wifes notes (modified): Cut Corned Beef into large chunks. Slice carrots  into size of quarters ($1 coins in AUS). Quarter potatoes. After the first  cooking of Corned Beef, remove meat and some juice and place on a  microwaveable plate. Nuke just before serving to reheat. Oh yeah! Plain  White, non-cider, Vinegar for cabbage (each person should drizzle their  own). Youll probably want to play with the time for cooking of the veggies  or else the cabbage turns to mush.    Actually most of this comes from the brochure for the Mirro-matic Speed  Pressure Cooker. Dated 1972. Which unlike our current model had an actual  guage so you knew at what pressure the beast was operating at, our current  one just jiggles at some pressure...dunno what it is.    bswisher@micronet.net or nobody@192.168.1.1    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 19, 98,
