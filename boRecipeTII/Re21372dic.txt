Union Grill Strawberry Sauce
Pinch cinnamon, Strawberries (1 pk frozen), Tabasco(optional), Grenadine syrup, Sugar, 
Throw the whole mess in the food processor/blender and hit the ani-hiliate  button, chill and drown what ever the intended destination!    We us this recipe with the tabasco for a breakfast blintz we serve for  sunday brunch during the summer, and it worked VERY well with this  cheesecake as well
