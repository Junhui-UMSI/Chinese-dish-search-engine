For The Pasta:    Following the instructions given in your owners manual, prepare and set up  the pasta machine with an extruder die to make the disired shape of pasta.    All ingredients must be at room temperature. Place the liquid ingredients  in a glass measuring cup. If less than 3/4 cup, add some water to make up  the balance.    Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the pasta  machine on. Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the feed tube. Mix  for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough appears to be coming  together in soft pea-sized crumbs.    Following the instructions given in your owners manual, begin to extrude  the dough. Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and discard. As the  pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from the machine. Cut with a  sharp paring knife or scissors at desired lengths. Place extruded pasta on  a wire rack or on a clean kitchen cloth. Let sit for at least 30 minutes  before cooking, or store for later use.    For The Pesto Sauce:    Put the garlic, basil leaves, and olive oil in a blender jar or food  processor bowl. Process until smooth. Add the feta cheese and walnuts and  process just until the cheese is blended into the mixture. The sauce should  have the same consistency as heavy cream. If too thick, add additional oil  or water, a tablespoon at a time.    The recipe for the Pesto Sauce makes enough for 4 servings when used as a  pasta sauce, which by the way, it pretty darn good!    Both recipes are from the book The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook by Tom  Lacalamita  Simon & Schuster ISBN# 0-671-50102-X.    Shared by Sandy Gamble <scg@indirect.com>
