Place the eggplant slices in a colander and toss with the salt. Let stand  for 30 minutes.  Rinse the eggplant well, under cold running water, and pat  dry with a kitchen towel. In a small bowl, combine the garlic and vinegar  and let stand while you cook the eggplant. Divide the oil between 2 large  skillets and heat until it sizzles. Add eggplant slices to both skillets,  without overcrowding, and fry until a deep golden on both sides, 12 to 15  minutes.  Repeat with any remaining slices. Transfer the fried slices to a  large bowl, without draining.  Let cool.  Place the cooled eggplant slices  in a serving dish in layers, sprinkling each layer with vinegar-garlic  mixture, pepper, salt (if needed), and cilantro. Cover and refrigerate for  at least 2 hours before serving.
