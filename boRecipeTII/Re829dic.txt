Herbed Pretzels
Warm water, Flour; sifted, Salt, Sugar, Yeast, Dried herbs, Egg substitute, Sesame seeds, 
If using a bread maker put in all ingredients, except egg substitute,  topping and spray oil and run on dough setting. If making by hand, place  all dry ingredients in bowl and mix. Add water in a well and combine. Kneed  until smooth and elastic. Set in a warm place, covered, to rise until  doubled (about 1 hour). Punch down and allow to rise again until doubled.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide dough into pieces (12, 8 inch lengths  would give you a dozen regular size pretzels). Make shapes or leave in  ropes for bread sticks. Spray a cookie sheet and place shapes on. Brush  with egg substitute and sprinkle with topping. For softer, browner pretzels  lightly spray top with spray oil. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until brown.
