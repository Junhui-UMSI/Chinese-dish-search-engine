"The Complete Book of Bread Machine Baking", edited by Lara Pizzorno    I dont know where they get the title since this is not 100% WW.  However,  I have been told that this is the best bread that I have made so far by two  different sources.  The crust has a nice crunch and the bread is light with  a delicious flavor. This book emphasizes healthy breads, that is why they  suggest canola instead of vegetable oil, unbleached flour instead of all  purpose flour, and why they add wheat germ. I dont doubt that you can  easily substitute.    "Therese Klodnicki" <Terry_Klodnicki@msn.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
