Whipped Cream Cake
****  NO   E  *****, 
One cup of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of soft butter stirred together;  add the yolks of two eggs well beaten, then add four tablespoonfuls of  milk, some flavoring, then the beaten whites of the eggs. Mix a teaspoonful  of cream of tartar and a half teaspoon of soda in a cup of flour, sift it  into the cake batter and stir lightly. Bake in a small dripping-pan. When  the cake is cool, have ready half a pint of sweet cream sweetened and  whipped to a stiff froth, also flavored. Spread it over the cake while  fresh. To whip the cream easily, set it on ice before whipping.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #224    Date: Mon, 23 Sep 1996 18:22:03 -0400    From: Ken Raymond <kraymond@mpls.k12.mn.us>
