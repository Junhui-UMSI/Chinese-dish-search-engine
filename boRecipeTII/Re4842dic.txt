Pack clean asparagus  into clean jars, add spices from above, pour vinegar mixture to 1/2 inch of  top. Process boiling water bath in 10 minutes. Will do 7 quarts. NOTE: 1  (20 pound) box of fresh asparagus makes about 10 quarts.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #63    From the MasterCook recipe list.
