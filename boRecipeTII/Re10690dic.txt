Quick Sourdough Pancakes
Eggs, Sweet Milk, Vegetable oil, Pancake Mix, Baking soda, Active Culture, 
Combine all ingredients, stir just until mixed. Batter should have small  lumps. Do not over mix or pancakes will be tough. Let stand a minute or two  than pour onto hot (400) lightly greased griddle. Cook until bubbles start  to break (2 to 3 minutes), turn and cook 1 to 2 minutes more or until  golden.    (Cooks Note)You can add fruit, very well drained, or replace half the flour  with whole wheat, rye etc.. I have also made oatmeal flour and used that  for half the flour.
