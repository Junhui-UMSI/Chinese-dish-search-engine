Philadelphia Online -- Philadelphia Daily News  http://www.phillynews.com:80/daily_news/97/Aug/06/features/ISLA06.htm    Coarsely puree the garlic, onion, chives, bell peppers, celery, chili  peppers, herbs and lime juice in a food processor or pound to a paste with  a mortar and pestle. Correct the seasoning, adding salt and pepper or lime  juice to taste. The mixture should be very flavorful. Store in a glass jar  with a non-reactive lid. Refrigerated, it will keep for several weeks, but  the sooner you use it, the better it will taste. Makes 2_1/2 cups -- enough  for 2 pounds of meat, chicken or seafood.
