1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion,  carrots, and 2 heaped tablespoons minced fresh ginger and cook, covered,  stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Add  the curry powder or garam masala and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1  minute more.    2. Stir in the pinto beans and the broth, turn the heat to high, and bring  the liquid to a boil. Turn the heat down to simmer and cook the mixture for  15 minutes or until the carrots are very tender.    3. In a blender or food processor, puree the soup in batches, then let it  cool completely. Cover the soup and chill it until it is cold, at least 2  hours.    4. Just before serving, whisk in the yogurt, divide the soup among 4 soup  bowls, and sprinkle with the chopped cilantro leaves and sliced scallions.
