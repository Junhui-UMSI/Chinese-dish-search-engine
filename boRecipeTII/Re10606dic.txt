This recipe was in this weeks Jet. I made it last night and had a thick  slice with apricot preserves slathered on it this morning for breakfast.  Its a keeper!    Heat oven to 350 degrees.* Grease 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Combine flour,  sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Add bananas, peanut spread,  milk, oil and egg. Beat at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping sides  and bottom of bowl. Mix just until blended (do not over-mix). Bake for  60-65 minutes or until a tooth pick inserted in center comes out clean.  (Cover top loosely with foil after 45 minutes to prevent over-browning.)  Cool 10 minutes in pan. Remove to cooling rack. Makes one loaf.    *If using glass, reduce temperature to 325 degrees.  My notes:    I used real peanut butter and skipped the salt. Next time, Ill reduce the  oil by half (p-nut butter has enough, think). I, for some reason, will also  add chopped, dried apricots or cranberries. Excellent banana bread!
