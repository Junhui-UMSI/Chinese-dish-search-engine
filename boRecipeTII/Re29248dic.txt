Baked Squash
Frozen squash, thrawed (6, Nonfat dry milk or the vegan, Pumpkin pie seasoning, Cups), Toasted oat bran, Equivalent), Nonfat dry buttermilk (or, Maple syrup, Grated fresh orange peel, 
Mix together oat bran, dry milk, orange peel, and seasoning. Wisk in squash  and syrup. Bake at 350 degrees in a large rectangular pan (I use glass) for  about an hour. Serve hot or cold.    Notes: 1. I buy oat bran in bulk. Toast it at 350 degrees on a cookie sheet  with edges. Stir every 10 minutes until light brown. I add the orange peel  at this point and store it in the refrigerator. Do not add the orange peel  before toasting, it burns. Already grated orange peel is available but the  fresh tastes better.    2. I have made this with many different kinds of squash and or sweet  potatoes.  They are all good.  The frozen squash is just the easiest.    3. Original recipe calls for cinnamon, I like the taste with the pumpkin  pie spice but Ive used others. I did not like plain clove. from "Lean and  Luscious and Meatless" by Hinman and Snyder.
