Its based on the hot peanut sauce  many African cuisines pour on nearly everything, but like a good deal of  modern African cooking, its taken on Asian influences and is now made with  tofu instead of chicken. (You could switch it back, of course.) All amounts  are VERY approximate.    1. Cook up some rice, preferably white Basmati. Let cool a bit--this dish  is best if only warm, not scalding, in the temperature sense.    2. Mince one onion and saute in oil till soft and beginning to brown.    3. Place sauteed onion in a blender and add above ingredients.    4. Whirl till smooth and thick but pourable, adding more tomato juice  and/or more peanut butter as needed/desired.    5. Slice up as much good firm tofu as you want and quick-fry till golden.  Park tofu over rice and drench with peanut sauce. Consume mass quantities.  Store leftover sauce--it stores well and is good at any temperature.  Paradisial for breakfast over mangoes.    If youre in a real rush, the onion isnt absolutely necessary.
