X-Casserole
wide egg noodles, Ground beef, Onion, 
This recipe came about one night upon getting home from work late, not  having alot of groceries in stock, so concocting what I had. Its simple  and easy. Now if I ask my hubby would he would like to eat tonight, I  always get the same answer = X-Casserole, please!!    Boil noodles according to package directions. Meanwhile brown onion until  transparent, add ground beef and cook thoroughly. Add the condensed tomato  soup (DO NOT ADD ANY WATER OR MILK!!) Mix together until heated. Drain  noodles and add them to meat mixture. Just stir together and serve.    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Barb & Jay <bhappy2@citrus.infi.net> on Jan  20, 1998
