Aloo Paratha
Ginger, Sugar, Oil for frying, juice of 1 lemon, Garlic flakes, Vegetable oil, Salt to taste, Potatoes, Coriander Leaves, Salt, Water, Wheat Flour, FILLING, 
Note: I use a scale to get these measurements exactly.    For the Dough: Add the oil and salt to the flour. Knead the flour with  water to make a soft dough.    For the filling: Boil the potatoes, remove skins and grate or mash. Add all  the masalas and mix well.    For the parathas: Divide dough into 20 round portions. Take each portion of  the dough; press to flatten it on the palm. Now put one portion of filling  on each and roll into 20 round shaped balls. With a rolling pin, flatten  the balls into 1/2" thick Parathas. Grease a cast iron skillet with a  little oil, and place on a medium fire. Cook the parathas on the skillet  till both sides are light brown.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Tania Hewes <taniah@NSERV1.CLSI.US.GEAC.COM> on
