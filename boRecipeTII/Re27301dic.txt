To Bake Frozen Dough in Clay Cooker
Butter, frozen bread dough, 
Brush sides and bottom of loaf-shaped, 5 1/2 cup clay cooker with half the  butter. Place frozen dough, bottom side up, in cooker. Brush dough with  remaining butter.    Let stand, covered with wax paper, in warm place until dough rises nearly  to the top of cooker, 1 to 3 hours.    To Bake: Soak top of cooker in water 15 min. and drain. Place covered  cooker in cold oven. Set oven temp. at 450 degrees and bake until brown,  about 40 - 45 minutes.    Remove from cooker and cool on a rack.
