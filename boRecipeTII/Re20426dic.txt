Vegan Mac and Cheese- Sort Of!
Serving macaroni of any, Great Northern beans (white, Mustard (optional), Several heaping spoonfuls of, Black pepper (optional), 
Boil macaroni as recommended by package. In separate pot, mix tahini,  beans, and mustard (optional) until hot.    Pour mixture over macaroni on serving plate. Add pepper to taste. Cayenne  pepper is a nifty touch although the tahini is very tasty already.    As a non-vegan I can truthfully say I find this yummier than real mac and  cheese.
