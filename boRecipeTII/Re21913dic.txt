Apples and Noodles
Brown sugar, Butter, Apples, peeled and sliced, Noodles, cooked and drained, Cinnamon, 
Preheat oven to 350 deg F.   Place half of the noodles and apples in a buttered baking dish. Sprinkle  with half the brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. Dot with half the butter.  Repeat. Cover and bake 30 minutes.   Stir well before serving (or, leave uncovered toward the end of baking to  give the top a nice crunchy texture.)
