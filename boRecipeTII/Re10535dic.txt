Quick Kimchi (Korean Mak Kimchi)
Chinese turnip, fresh ginger, Water, Chinese cabbage, Cayenne pepper, Salt, Garlic, Scallions, 
1.  Wash the leaves of a Chinese cabbage and cut them into 2-inch lengths  (the leafy end may be left longer; it will shrivel the most). Peel the  Chinese turnip, halve it lengthwise down the center and then slice thin  across the grain.    2.  Combine the salt and water. Place the vegetables in a large pot. Pour  the salted water over the surface of the vegetables and cover the pot.  Leave overnight.    3.  The next day, mince the scallions, garlic and ginger. Drain the  vegetables, which should be wilted and reserve the salty water. Season with  the cayenne, scallion, garlic and ginger. Mix the vegetables by hand, using  rubber gloves if available. Pack this mixture tightly into jars. Pour the  salted water over the mixture so that the liquid comes to within 1/2 inch  of the top of the jar.    4.  Keep at room temperature for 2 or 3 days, then refrigerate.    Makes about 2 jars of kimchi which should be enough for a large dinner  party.    From: The Korean Cookbook, By Judy Hyun.
