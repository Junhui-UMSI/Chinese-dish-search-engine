Recipe by: McDougall Place beans in pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring to  boil, remove from heat and let rest 1 hour. Then add chopped onion, garlic,  and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.    Chop potatoes in large chunks; do not peel. Slice carrots 1/2 inch and  zucchini 1 inch thick, scrub them, do not peel. Slice leeks and cut beans  into 1 inch pieces. Add to soup pot along with seasonings. Simmer for 1  hour longer.    Thinly slice cabbage and add to soup along with rice or spaghetti. Simmer  another 20 minutes. Add more water if too thick. Add tomato wedges for the  last 10 minutes, just before serving.    HELPFUL HINTS: Kidney beans make a good rich broth, but any kind of bean  also may be used. Soup freezes well, so make a large batch when you have  time and freeze half for use on a budy day. Try using some chopped spinach,  instead of the cabbage. By changing the vegetables and beans used, the soup  can be different each time you make it. It is a meal in itself.
