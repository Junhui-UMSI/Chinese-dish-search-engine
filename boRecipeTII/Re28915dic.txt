Heat the oil in a skillet to medium-high heat and saute garlic, onion,  chile, lime leaves or zest, curry powder and lemon grass for 2 to 3  minutes. Then stir in coconut milk, milk, cinnamon, bay leaves, tamarind  sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice and peanut butter. Mix  ingredients well, reduce heat and cook, stirring frequently, until sauce  thickens.  This takes about 30 minutes. Remove bay and lime leaves and  serve.  Do not let sauce stick and burn to bottom of pan.    Adapted from Keos Thai Cuisine, Keo Sananikone, Ten Speed Press. 1986    I like to blender the onion, lemon grass and garlic so the sauce is smooth  in texture.  You can also mince them and use chunky peanut butter if you  like chunks in your sauce.    bwight@ix.netcom.com (William Wight)    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
