Porcupine Quills
Salt, Pitted dates (cut up), Vanilla, Egg whites (Beaten stiff), Walnut pieces, Brown sugar, 
Mix ingredients together (except coconut). Drop from teaspoon into the  sweetened featherflake coconut. Roll into balls. Cook in slow oven (325 to  350) until nice and brown (between 10 and 15 minutes). Dont bake them on  the lower oven racks as the coconut burns too easily.
