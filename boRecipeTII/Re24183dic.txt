Trail Mix Tin Can Quick Bread
Cinnamon; optional, Salt, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Almond extract; optional, Hot water, Dried fruit bits, Baking soda, All-purpose flour, Chopped walnuts; or pecans, 
For fruit - dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries, currants or raisins  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.    Grease and flour two 1-pound coffee cans or 2 9x5-inch loaf pans and line  bottoms with wax paper. Grease and flour the wax paper.    Place the fruit bits or raisins in a large bowl, cover with the hot water,  and stir in the baking soda. Cover with plastic wrap and leave overnight to  plump. All of the liquid is used in the batter, so dont drain.    Mix together the fruit bits or fruit or raisins, soaking water, sugar, oil,  salt, flour, and the nuts. Stir to blend. Add the cinnamon and almond  extract if desired. The batter should be thick enough to spoon. If thin,  add a small amount of flour.    Spoon the batter into the prepared cans, filling between 1/2 to 2/3 full.  Push the batter down into the bottom with a spatula. Bake 1 hour, or until  a deep, dark brown.    Remove the bread from the oven and allow to sit for 10 minutes before  slipping them out of the containers. Let the breads cool completely on wire  racks. When completely cooled, return the breads to the cans and cover with  their plastic lids or wrap tightly in plastic.    They will keep for 3 or 4 months stored in the refrigerator.
