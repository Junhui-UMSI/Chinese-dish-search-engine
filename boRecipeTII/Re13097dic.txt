Witches Hats
Bag, Keebler shortbread Fudge, White icing, make or use --, Stripped cookies, Hershey kisses -- unwrapped, Canned frosting, 
1. Turn cookie upside down-chocolate side facing up 2. Put icing into a  cake decorating bag with tip.  If using canned frosting just micro a few  seconds, be careful not to overdue it (speaking from experience) 3. Pipe  enough icing onto cookie to cement the Hershey kiss to the middle of the  cookie. 4. Pip a "bow" on hat.
