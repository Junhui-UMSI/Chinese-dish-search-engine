Soy sauce, Onion, Water, fresh hot green, Rutabaga, Ground cuminseed, Salt, tomato, Chinese tofu cake, Corn oil, 
1.  Cut the tofu into 5 rectangles about 1 inch wide, 2 inches long and 1/4  inch thick.  Dry them well on paper towels.    2.  Heat a dry skillet for 1 minute, then add the oil (this prevents the  tofu fromn sticking).  Fry the tofu over moderate heat to a light-brown on  both sides. Remove and set aside. Remove all but 1 tablespoon oil.    3.  Brown the onion in the oil over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Add the  rutabaga slices and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the tomato, chili, soy  sauce, cuminseed, and salt and stir fry for 1 minute. Add the water, cover  the skillet, and cook for 5 minutes.    4.  Add the tofu, stir for a moment, cover the skillet, and cook for 3  minutes more.    Serve warm with bread.  An excellent side dish for vegetarians.    Note:  Firm vegetables such as chayote and the white turnip with a mauve  top can also be used in this preparation. The contrast of the browned tofu  and the soft turnip is pleasant to the palate, and the flavorings give it  an unusual and distinctive character.
