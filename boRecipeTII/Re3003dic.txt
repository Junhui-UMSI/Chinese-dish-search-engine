Peanut Butter Tater Candy
Smooth peanut butter, Salted peanuts; chopped,, Vanilla extract, White potato, 
Boil potato (with skin on) until done.  Peel; remove any eyes or spots.     In a mixing bowl, mash the potato thoroughly with a fork or electric  mixer at slow speed.  Add vanilla. Gradually add confectioners sugar ((use  a fork, as mixture begins to firm) until it forms a ball. Turn out on a  confectioners sugar covered surface (instead of flour). Roll the ball out  flat and oblong until it is 1/4-inch thick.     Spread peanut butter evenly over the flat surface. Sprinkle the chopped  peanuts evenly over peanut butter (if you opt to use them). Cut the flat  surface in half the short way. Roll jelly-roll fashion, sealing the edges.  (2 rolls.)   Place in refrigerator until chilled and firm. Slice into  1/3-inch pieces. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.       Source.  The Oklahoma Peanut Commission. Wis/Gramma.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #038 by "Griff" <wgriffin@ix.netcom.com> on  Feb 5, 1997.
