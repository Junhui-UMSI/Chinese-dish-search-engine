Combine dry ingredients, add water and beat thoroughly. Dip hot dogs in  batter and quickly drop them in hot vegetable oil at 375 degrees. Bake 3  minutes or until golden brown.  You should have enough batter for 8, maybe  10 hot dogs.  Your hot dogs should be dry and at room temperature before  dipping.  Happy dipping! Randy Rigg
