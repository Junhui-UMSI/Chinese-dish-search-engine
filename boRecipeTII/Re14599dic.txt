"Little Chief" Beef and Game Jerky
Garlic powder, Water, Tabasco sauce, Soy sauce, Red wine, Sugar, Salt, Pepper, Onion powder, 
Trim all fat from meat.  Slice meat with the grain to about 1/4" to 1/2"  thick.  The meat slices nicely when semi-frozen, or your butcher will slice  it for you in his machine.  Place meat in the cool marinade and leave  overnight, or for no less than 8 hours.    Remove from brine and allow to air dry without rinsing.  Smoke in your  smoker for 12 to 16 hours or until jerky has dried out to your liking. Use  your favorite fuel for smoking.
