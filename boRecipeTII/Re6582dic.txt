In a large pot or dutch oven, bring the water, wine, herbs, spices, and  lemon zest to a boil.  Lower the heat and simmer 10 minutes.   Gently lower the trout into the liquid.  Simmer, partially uncovered,  until firm to the touch, about 10 minutes (or 10 minutes per inch of  thickness of the fish).    Using 2 spatulas, lift each trout out and place it on a dinner plate.    Blend the butter with 2 tsps. of the cooking liquid (with as much of the  herbs as you can retrieve), and spoon over the fish. Serve immediately with  lemon wedges alongside.
