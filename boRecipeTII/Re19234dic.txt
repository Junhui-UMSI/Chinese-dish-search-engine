Soak quinoa in a bowl of cold water and rub the quinoa between your hands.  Drain and repeat the process a couple of times. Combine quinoa with 8 cups  of cold water and bring to a boil.    Lower heat and simmer from 8 to 10 minutes or until just cooked and grains  have turned translucent. Take care not to overcook; quinoa should have some  crunch to it. Drain but do not rinse and transfer to a 13 x 9-inch pan to  cool; fluff with fork and hold until ready to eat.    Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Add ginger and carrot and saute for  about a minute, stirring frequently. Add bell peppers and saute for 2  minutes to soften. Add peas and corn and saute a minute to heat through.  Add quinoa and saute long enough, stirring, just to reheat. Season to taste  with salt and pepper    Remove the quinoa from heat and stir in scallions, mint and almonds; serve  immediately.
