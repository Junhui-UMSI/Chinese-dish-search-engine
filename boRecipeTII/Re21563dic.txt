Apple Preserves
Lemon; thinly sliced, Ground nutmeg, Peeled-cored-sliced apples, Lemon juice, Sugar, Pectin, Water, 
This is NOT jam.  I like to use these warmed as a side dish (like    escalloped apples). This is from the Ball Blue Book.    Mix apples, water, lemon juice in large pot. Simmer covered 10 min. Stir in  pectin and bring to full rolling boil, stir frequently. Add lemon  slices/sugar and bring to full rolling boil again and boil for 1 min, stir  frequently.  Remove from heat and add nutmeg. Pour into hot jars or cool  and put into freezer containers. If canning, process 10 min in boiling  water bath. Yield 6 half pints.   IF FREEZING, MAKE SURE YOU COOL FIRST, IT  WILL BE HOT ENOUGH TO MELT PLASTIC !!!! (I speak from experience !)
