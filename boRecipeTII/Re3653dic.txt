Peking Doilies (Bork Bang)
All purpose flour; sifted, ****  NO   E  *****, Boiling water + 2 tsp., Sesame oil (or veg. oil), 
PREPARATION: Mix boiling water with flour and knead        for 10 minutes.  Let dough rest for 10 minutes. Break into 12-14 pieces. Roll each into a  round ball, then       flatten each with heel of the hand and brush half of  the rounds with sesame or vegetable oil. Top with          other half of  the rounds. Roll each round to a 4 inch      to 5 inch diameter. COOKING:  Heat a Teflon or a heavy      bottomed skillet over medium heat. Cook  doilies for 1 minute or less each side. Doilies should turn just very  lightly beige Cool for several seconds and            separate doilies as  soon you can, while they are still hot. DO AHEAD NOTES: These can be made  in advance a frozen. Steam frozen doilies for 12 minutes or, if t hawed  out, 6-7 minutes will do. COMMENTS: To make         good doilies, observe  the following 3 points: 1) The       dough should be a bit on the "dry"  side. (Not too dry or the doilies will crack, but definitely not so soft  they become too mushy for rolling and separating. 2) Oil the flattened  dough well, especially on the edges, in order to have an easier time when  pulling them apart. 3) Roll doilies out and away in 1 stroke from center in  all directions to insure evenness and a good round shape. Do not roll in  back and forth motion, since the edges may fold in and you will have a hard  time separating the doilies. It would also be helpful      if you have a  tortilla press. Before you begin rolling     the 2 doilies together (they  are a bit slippery            because of the oil in between press them on  the            tortilla press and it will help you started much quicker.
