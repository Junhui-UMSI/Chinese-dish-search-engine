Sweet Potato Curry
Sweet potato, Hot pepper flakes, Curry powder, Onion, cornstarch, Water, Water, 
"Saute" the onions in a wok or large frying pan until soft.  Add the sweet  potato and seasonings.  Stir until the curry powder forms a paste on the  vegetables, adding more liquid if necessary.  Add enough liquid to _almost_  cover the sweet potato and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover and  simmer for about 15 minutes or until the sweet potato is tender. Thicken  with the cornstarch paste. Enjoy.    Source: Apparent original.    Posted by Ed Resnick<EResnick@wecnotes.semcor.com> to the Fatfree Digest  [Volume 15 Issue 31] Mar. 3, 1995.
