Basic Brine
Water, Non-iodized salt, Sugar, 
Fill a large container with 1/2 quart of warm water. Add salt and sugar.  Mix thoroughly until well dissolved. Add the remaining 1/2 quart of water.    Immerse prepared fish chunks, filets or small whole fish completely in  brine solution. Refrigerate fish in brine solution. Brine chunks of fish of  fish 1" thick for about 5 up to 8 hours, 1/2" thick for about 4 hours, and  for thinner filets or pieces 2-3 hours.    After brining, always rinse your fish with plenty of fresh water. Pat the  fish dry, and allow them to air dry for about 1 hour. This will cause a  "pellicle" (a tacky glaze on the fish) to form indicating that it is ready  for the drying and smoking process.  courtesy of: starfishcons@starfishcons.com    Posted to bbq-digest by Jeff Lipsitt                          Cable on Apr  23, 1998
