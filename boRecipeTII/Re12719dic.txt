Stir  in the rest of the milk and allow the mix to rest for an hour if possible.    Heat a roasting tin containing the lard in a hot oven (220 C), pour in the  batter and cook for about 45 min until well-risen and golden. Serves four.    Tips:    1. Use a metal tin.    2. If you have problems getting the pudding to rise, add an extra egg or  some ground white pepper.    Traditionally, Yorkshire Pudding was cooked underneath a joint of beef so  as to catch the cooking juices. It was then eaten as a "starter". Nowadays  it is usually eaten as an accompaniment.    Variations:    Toad in the Hole: Part cook some sausages in the roasting pan before adding  the batter.  You may need to drain some of the excess fat.    Chop Toad: Replace the sausages with lamb chops    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
