Mustard Sauce:  ==============         Mix all ingredients in a bowl to form a smooth sauce.    Veal:  =====         Lightly flour the veal slices.         In a saute pan, warm the oil then saute the veal for 1 minute on  each side.         Drain off the oil and add wine to the pan (do not cover the veal  with the wine).  Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat and  add chicken broth, brown gravy, and mustard sauce.  Add 1 teaspoon of  chopped parsley and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.         Remove the veal slices from the pan and arrange them onto a  serving dish.         If your sauce is too thick, add a little broth; if its too thin,  add some cream.  Heat the sauce well and pour it liberally over the  veal.          Garnish the dish with chopped parsley.
