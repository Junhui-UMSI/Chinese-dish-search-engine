Welsh Rarebit
A little mustard, A tomato; (or two, as you, Grated hard cheese, milk, A thick slice of toast;, 
Mix the cheese, milk and mustard and spread thickly over the toast. Make  sure the edges are covered, so the bread does not burn. Cook under a hot  grill until bubbling and starting to brown. Slice the tomato and put a  couple of slices on top, and re-heat briefly.    Serve with the other tomato slices.    NOTE: There is an English abomination of this recipe in which beer is used.  If you must use beer, keep it for washing your hair!    http://www.grossi.co.uk/wales/recipe.htm  Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 17, 1998
