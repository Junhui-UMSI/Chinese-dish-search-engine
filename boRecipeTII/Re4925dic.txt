Pickled Ginger (Amazu Shoga)
Fresh ginger root, MARINADE, sugar, Salt, Rice vinegar, Water, 
This recipe comes from "The Poetical Pursuit of Food : Japanese Recipes for  American Cooks" by Sonoko Kondo.    This is the ginger that is served with sushi.    Wipe ginger with a clean damp cloth. Peel and sprinkle with salt. Let  stand, covered for 1 day.    Combine the ingredients for the marinade in a glass pickling jar. Mix well  until the sugar is dissolved. Add ginger and cover for a week.    To serve, slice root thinly, about 1/8" thick along the grain.    The pickled ginger will keep in the refrigerator for 4 months and will turn  quite pink.
