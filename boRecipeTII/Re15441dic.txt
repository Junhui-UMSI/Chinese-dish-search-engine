White Chocolate Amaretto Cheesecake
1/2 c. sugar (up to 1), (3 pkgs) softened cream, Sour cream, <--Topping-->, <--Cheesecake-->, Heavy cream, Amaretto, Sour cream, Eggs, 9 oz. good quality white, 
Use butter cookie or brown sugar cookie dough to make a crust. Or make a  cookie crumb crust.    Cheesecake: Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar. Beat  in eggs one at a time. Melt white chocolate with heavy cream (in double  boiler or in microwave, but if using microwave, stop and stir every 20  seconds). Beat white chocolate, Amaretto, and sour cream into batter. Beat  a while longer. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven 55-60 minutes. If top  starts to become too brown, cover w/ foil part-way through baking. Or  refrigerate cake and just slice top off cheesecake when cool.    Topping: Whisk together. Add a touch of Amaretto or vanilla. Spoon over top  of cake, letting some drip over the sides.    Serve w/ fresh fruit, if desired.    Notes: (1) Youll probably want less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar since the  white chocolate & the Amaretto are both sweet. Add 1 cup, taste batter,  then add more if needed. (2) Suggested chocolates: Tobler Narcisse, Lindt,  Valhrona white chocolate couverture, Callebaut, etc.)    From : Ari Rapkin    Busted and entered for you by: Bill Webster  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #299 by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Nov  18, 97
