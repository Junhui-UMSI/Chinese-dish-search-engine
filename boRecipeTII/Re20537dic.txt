In an 8-inch nonstick skillet with sloping sides, melt butter over medium  heat. Add apple slices in one layer. Cook for 2 minutes. Sprinle with 1 tsp  sugar and cinnamon to taste. Cook until tender, 3 to 5 minutes longer.    In a small bowl, combine eggs, 1 tsp sugar and water. Beat with a fork  until eggs are just blended. Pour over apples in skillet.    Stir with spatula to allow egg mixture to cover bottom of pan. Use spatula  to gently push cooked portions to the centre, tilting the skillet to allow  the uncooked egg to flow into empty spaces. When egg is almost set on  surface, sprinkle cheese over half of omelette. Slip spatula under unfilled  side, fold over filling and slide onto serving plate. Sprinkle with  cinnamon sugar and serve immediately.    TIP:  Recipe may be doubled to make two servings.  If more that two  servings are required, keep the first omelette warm and repeat the recipe.    Complete this meal with a green salad, whole wheat rolls and chocolate  instant pudding prepared with milk.
