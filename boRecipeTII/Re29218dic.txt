Salt, Green Olives, Lemon juice, Egg yolks, Sole, Fresh, Water, Pepper, Chicken broth, Butter, Flour, All-Purpose, 
Pre-heat oven to 350F.  Grease a large shallow baking dish.  Arrange  fillets in dish.  Sprinkle fillets with salt and pepper.  Dot with 2 T  butter.  Bake for 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a  fork.  Start sauce preparation about 15 minutes before you put the fish in  the oven.  In a cup, mix egg yolks with water, set aside.  In heavy  saucepan over medium heat, into 1 T of hot butter, stir flour until well  blended.  Gradually stir in chicken broth and lemon juice.  Cook with  stirring until mixture is thickened.  Remove saucepan from heat.  Into egg  yolks, stir 6-8 drops of Tabasco Sauce.  Slowly pour egg mixture into  sauce, stirring rapidly to avoid lumping.  Cook with stirring until  thickened (DO NOT BOIL).  Spoon off any excess liquid from fish.  Pour  sauce over fish and garnish with sliced stuffed green olives.  The olives  add a lot more to this dish than you might imagine. From: Syds Cookbook.
