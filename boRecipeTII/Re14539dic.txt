"Fan"-Tastic Toppers
Mexican seasonings 1/4, Keebler Toasteds=99 or, (4 ounces) frozen salad, Prepared salsa, Chopped cilantro; plus, Light or regular sour cream, 
Found this on the Keebler web site (I think the URL is www.keebler.com/):  In a medium bowl, combine sour cream, 1/2 cup shrimp, salsa, 1/4 cup  cilantro, Mexican seasonings and salt. Mix well.    Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours before serving.  To serve, garnish dip with remaining 1/4 cup shrimp and cilantro sprigs;  serve with crackers. Makes about 2 cups of dip.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest by Lee Ann Hamm <lhamm@premier.net> on Feb  02, 1998
