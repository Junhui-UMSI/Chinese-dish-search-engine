To make meringue: Preheat oven to 275 degrees farenheit. Cover a baking  sheet with parchment paper (preferred) or aluminum foil. Mark 9" circle or  whatever shape strikes your fancy (a heart works well). Set aside.    In a mixing bowl, beat eggs whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar and  beat until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar and continuing beating  until stiff peaks form. Put small amount of meringue in a pastry bag and  pipe around edge of your marked design on the parchment. Take remaining  meringue and smooth inside your piped design. With the back of a spoon  build up edge a bit.    Bake for 1 hour. Turn off oven and leave for additional hour - do not open  oven door. Remove from oven and cool completely.    Preparing the filling: Beat cream cheese, sugar, strawberry gelatin and  vanilla until smooth and fluffy. Setting aside one cup of the whipped cream  for decoration, fold in remaining whipped cream. Fill the meringue shell.  Refrigerate until set.    Preparing the topping : Stir together sliced strawberries and the  preserves. Remove meringue from refrigerator. Spread strawberry mix on top  of filling. Decorate with reserved whipped cream.
