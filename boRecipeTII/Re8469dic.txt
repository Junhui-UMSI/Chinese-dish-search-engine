Boil the potatoes in lightly salted water to cover until tender. Drain,  cool and peel.    Put potatoes through a ricer or grate them. When cool mix in the Gruyere,  Parmesan and herbs.  Remove stems from tomatoes and cut into even slices 1/4 inch thick. Pat dry  with paper towels and place in a single layer in a lightly oiled baking  sheet. Sprinkle with the garlic, a little olive oil and lightly season with  salt and pepper. Place in a preheated 375 degree oven and bake for 12-14  minutes or until slightly dry. Cool.    In a small saute pan, saute the onion in butter until soft but not brown.  Stir into potato mixture.    Generously butter a 9-inch by 2-inch springform pan. Mix the bread crumbs  and nuts together and coat the pan evenly, reserving 3 tablespoons for  topping the torta. Spread one third of the potato mixture over the bottom  of the pan evenly to the edge. Layer one half of the tomato slices on top,  slightly overlapping them. Layer one half of the artichoke hearts on top.  Add another layer of potato and the rest of the tomato slices and artichoke  hearts. Top with remaining potato mixture. Drizzle a bit of olive oil over  top and sprinkle with reserved crumbs.    Place on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for one  hour or until the surface is golden brown. Cool for 15 minutes before  releasing springform pan. Serve warm or at room temperature.
