Shape the  mixture into 12 thin patties, each about 4-inches in diameter.  Top each  of 6 patties with 1 Tbls of the cottage cheese, spreading to within  1/2-inch of the edge, sprinkle on 2 tsp of the Parmesan cheese, and top  each patty with one of the remaining patties sealing the edges firmly.  Brown the patties in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning once.  Drain off the fat and pour the tomato sauce over the patties.  Cover and  simmer for about 15 minutes.  Place a cheese slice on each patty, cover,  and heat until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.  Serve with the  remaining sauce in the skillet poured over them.
