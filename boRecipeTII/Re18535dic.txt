Juice, Cocoa, Salt, Sugar, Flour, Baking soda, Cold water, Unsweetened, good quality, Plus 2 Tbs corn oil, White vinegar or lemon, Vanilla, 
Mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt together and then sift the  mixture. In a separate bowl mix the water, corn oil vanilla and  vinegar or lemon juice. The whisk the wet and dry mixtures together.  Pour through a strainer into a clean bowl, breaking up and pressing  through any lumps. Mix again and the pour the mixture into a greased  9 x 13 x 2-inch pan. Tap the edge of the pan against the counter or,  for more fun but comparable results, drop the entire pan from a  height of about 6-inches onto the counter top or the floor a few  times to pop and dislodge any air bubbles. Bake at 350 degrees for 25  to 30 minutes.    Trust this recipe. The omission of eggs or butter is not an  oversight. And you must pop the air bubbles as directed. Ive had  this cake several times and it IS good!
