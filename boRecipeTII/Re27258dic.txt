Gently fold 1 cup whipped topping into the  cheese mixture.    Combine 1/2 cup sugar and next 2 ingredients in the top of a double boiler;  place over simmering water. Beat at high speed of a mixer until stiff peaks  form. Gently stir one-fourth of egg white mixture into cheese mixture.  Gently fold in remaining egg white mixture; set aside.    Combine hot water and next 3 ingredients; stir well. Split the ladyfingers  in half lengthwise. Arrange 20 ladyfinger halves, cut sides up, in the  bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish. Drizzle half of the espresso  mixture over ladyfinger halves. Spread half of cheese mixture over  ladyfinger halves; repeat procedure with the remaining ladyfinger halves,  espresso mixture, and cheese mixture. Spread remaining 1/2 cup whipped  topping evenly over cheese mixture; sprinkle with cocoa.    Place one toothpick in each corner and in center of Tiramisu to prevent  plastic wrap from sticking to whipped topping; cover with plastic wrap.  Chill 2 hours. Yield: 8 servings (serving size: 1 [4 x 2-inch] piece).    NOTES : Try freezing Tiramisu for two hours before serving so it will cut  cleanly.
