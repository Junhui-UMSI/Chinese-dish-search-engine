Add pork, turning tenderloins to coat completely.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight, turning meat occasionally. Drain  pork, reserving marinade. Place tenderloins on wire rack over baking pan.  Bake in preheated 350F oven, turning and basting often with reserved  marinade, until cooked through, about 45 minutes. Remove pork from oven;  cool. Cut into diagonal slices. Makes about 8 appetizer size servings This  is very nice served with green onion curls.
