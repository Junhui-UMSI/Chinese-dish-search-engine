Strawberry Cream Cheese Poundcake
Fresh strawberries --, Sugar, Flour, Salt, Eggs -- room temperature, Cream cheese -- softened, Butter flavoring, Butter -- softened, Sliced, 
Cream the cheese, butter, and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add a  pinch of salt and the butter flavoring, and beat the mixture well. Add the  eggs, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Stir in the  flour. Gradually add the sliced strawberries, gently folding them in after  each addition.    Spoon the batter into a buttered and floured cake pan (I use loaf pans or  those nice little mini-loaf sizes for gift-giving), and bake the cake in a  preheated 325-degree (F) oven for one-and-a-half hours, until the cake  begins to shrink from the sides of the pan.    Place the pans on cooling racks until cooled; turn cakes gently onto wire  racks.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #066 by "Darlene R. Lindgard"  <drl@halcyon.com> on Mar 06, 1997.
