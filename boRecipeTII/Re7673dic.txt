Pork with Almond Crust
Flour, olive oil, Thick, Butter, Cracker crumbs, Buttermilk, Cayenne pepper, Lemon wedges; garnish, Salt, Ground coriander, Pork loin cutlets;  pound, Green onions; sliced, Eggs, Sliced almonds, 
In a small bowl, mix together the eggs and buttermilk. In another bowl,  combine the flour, cracker crumbs, almonds, salt, cayenne pepper, and  coriander. Dip the pounded cutlets into the egg mixture, then dredge them  in the flour mixture, pressing the breading on to make the almonds adhere.  Lay the cutlets on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This  can be done up to 24 hours in advance. When ready to serve, heat enough  butter and olive oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet until "singing"  hot. Cook the cutlets 3 at a time, turning and cooking about 3 to 4 minutes  per side, or until the almonds are golden and browned. Drain on paper  towels. Sprinkle with the sliced green onions and accompany with the lemon  wedges.
