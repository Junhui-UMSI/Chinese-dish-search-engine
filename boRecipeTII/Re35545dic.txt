Strawberry/rhubarb
(16 oz) frozen rhubarb, cut, Container (16 oz) frozen, Strawberry ( or other "red"), 
Dump frozen rhubarb and frozen strawberries in saucepan and simmer on very  low heat til all is defrosted and mixed together. Add jello. Cool. Puree in  food processor or, if you have one of those electric hand blenders that you  can put right in the pot, use that. Chill. It will not jell like jello, but  is more the consistency of applesauce. Easy and Good.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #052 by MUFFYMOM@aol.com on Feb 16, 1997.
