Using a 2-inch cutter,  make an indentation about 1/4-inch through center of pastry rounds, and  lightly brush tops with beaten egg. Freeze 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 450  degrees; place pastry in oven. Reduce temperature to 400 degrees, and bake  20 to 25 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. Remove to wire rack to  cool.  Remove centers of patty shells. Yield: 4 shells.    Posted to Bakery Shoppe Digest148 by novmom@juno.com (Angela Gilliland) on  Jul 06, 1997
