Place the egg,the  margarine (which has been melted), and milk in the well.  Stir with a  wooden spoon just until the ingredients are combined.  Quickly stir in the  raspberries and lemon zest. Fill muffin tins, which have been sprayed with  a non-stick coating, three fourths full.  Make the topping by combining  the pecans, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and lemon zest together.  Pour  in the melted margarine and stir to combine into crumbs.  Sprinkle evenly  over the tops of each muffin.  Bake in a 350 degree F. oven for 20 to 25  minutes.  Cool on racks.
