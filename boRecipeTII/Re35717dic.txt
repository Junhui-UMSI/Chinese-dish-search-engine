Stuffed Cabbage Rolls with Yogurt Dill Sauce
Green cabbage; cored, Plain yogurt; divided, Green onions; sliced, Ground lamb, TABASCO pepper sauce, Salt, Garlic, Fresh snipped dill; divided, olive oil, 
Over high heat, heat large pot of water to boiling. Add cabbage, core-end  down. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and simmer until leaves are softened,  10-12 minutes. Remove cabbage to bowl of cold water. Separate 16 large  leaves from head of cabbage. Trim tough ribs on back of leaves so that they  will roll up easily. Chop enough of remaining cabbage to make 3 cups.    In 12-inch skillet, over medium heat, in hot oil, cook chopped cabbage,  green onions and garlic until tender, about 10 minutes, stirring  occasionally. With slotted spoon, remove to bowl. In drippings remaining in  skillet over high heat, cook ground lamb until well browned on all sides,  stirring frequently. Remove to bowl with cabbage.    In food processor, blend lamb mixture until finely ground. In large bowl,  toss lamb mixture with 1/2 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons dill, TABASCO sauce  and salt to mix well. Place 3 tablespoons lamb mixture at bottom of cabbage  leaf and roll up tightly to form a 3-inch-long roll, tucking ends in as you  roll. Repeat with remaining lamb and leaves.    Preheat oven to 400F. Place cabbage rolls on rack in roasting pan. Add 1  cup boiling water; cover pan tightly with foil. Bake 20 minutes or until  rolls are hot.    Meanwhile, in medium bowl, combine remaining 1 1/2 cups yogurt and 2  tablespoons dill. To serve, remove cabbage rolls to platter; top with  Yogurt-Dill Sauce.    Makes 4 servings.
