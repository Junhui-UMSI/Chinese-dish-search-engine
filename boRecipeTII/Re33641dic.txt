Sprinkle yeast into 1/4 cup lukewarm water,  add 1 tablespoon sugar, cover lightly and set aside in a warm place for 5  to 10 minutes, or until foamy. Scald remaining half and half and add 1/3  cup of sugar, salt and butter, and stir until butter melts. Cool to  lukewarm. Add to yeast mixture along with strained saffron milk (if you are  sure all saffron is dissolved, straining is unnecessary) and 1 beaten egg.  Mix well.    Gradually stir in flour until  mixture is smooth and not sticky, but still  soft and pliable.  Knead for 10 minutes, or until shiny and elastic. Place  in a lightly floured bowl, dust top of dough with flour, cover loosely and  set to rise in draft-free corner until double in bulk - about 1 1/2 hours.  Punch dough down and knead for 2 or 3 minutes. Shape into forms ("cats" are  below; sorry I cant show you the drawings in the book) - Let rise 30  minutes and bake in preheated 400 F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350  F and bake 30 minutes more, or until golden brown.    Lussekatter - Lucia Cats:  Pinch off small bits of dough and roll into  sausage shapes 5-7 inches long.  Place these strips together in pairs,  pinching centers to join them and coiling four ends out.  Brush with egg  yolk glaze and bake. Using a little egg white, stick a raisin or currant in  the center of each coil of the hot buns.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
