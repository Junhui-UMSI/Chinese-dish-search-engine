Source: One of my Passover Cookbooks (I dont remember which one)    Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat on high until stiff  peaks form. Freeze.    We served it ala mode on sponge cake but its good as a sorbet kind of  thing in a bowl. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #149 by "Marsha Lefko"  <mlefko@dct.com> on May 2, 1997
