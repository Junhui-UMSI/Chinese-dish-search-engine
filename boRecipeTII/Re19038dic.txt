In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook cabbage         for 2 minutes. Peel off two outer leaves carefully and         repeat the process until six large outer leaves in all are         removed. Reserve the remaining cabbage for another use and         cut the ribs from the six cabbage leaves.    Line a buttered 1-quart round baking dish with the         cabbage leaves, leaving some overhang to cover the filling.         Layer the green beans, peas, carrots, leeks and spinach over         the cabbage leaves. In a small bowl, whisk together the         eggs, milk, salt and pepper to taste. Pour mixture over the         vegetables and fold the overhanging cabbage over the         filling. Cover the dish with foil, put in a baking pan, and         add enough boiling water to the pan to come 1 inch up the         side of the dish.    Bake the vegetable mixture in a preheated 350-degree         oven for 1 hour. Remove the dish from the baking pan and let         cake cool for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and run a knife         around the edge of the cake. Invert the cake onto a serving         plate.    To make the sauce: In a skillet, cook scallions in oil         over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, for 10         minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, salt and cayenne. Cook the         mixture, stirring, for 3 minutes. Puree the mixture in a         food processor or blender. Add the milk and blend sauce         until smooth. Serve over vegetable cake.
