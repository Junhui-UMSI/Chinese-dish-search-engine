I love Puerto Rican Food!... Its usually simple, yet rich with lots of  cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can be  simplified to taste.  I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and garlic  with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).    I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).    FILLING:    * Enough tomato sauce so that mixture holds together and yet is quite dry.  Combine and cook mixture for 30 minutes to 1 hr.    PLANTAINS:    Bring water to boil and add salt.  Add plantains and boil rapidly for 20  minutes.  Drain, peel and mash together with butter, salt, and cornstarch.  Allow to cool slightly.    Dust hand palms with cornstarch.  Spread some of the plantain mixture in  cupped hand and make nest in center.  Stuff center with filling. Cover with  plantain mixture and shape into balls.  Repeat to make 16 stuffings.    Deep-fry at 375 degrees F until golden brown. Remove and drain on absorbent  paper.
