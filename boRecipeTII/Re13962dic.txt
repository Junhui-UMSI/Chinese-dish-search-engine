Well, I wing my fajitas every time I do them, but heres a guess at the  measurements.     In a large wok, warm the oil.  Cook the chicken slices until done, stir  regularly.  Add everything except tortillas.  Mix well.  Cook covered. Stir  every few minutes.  Its done when the peppers are tender and the  vegetables are starting to get browned in spots. Serve with warmed flour  tortillas. (I warm them individually in the microwave for 20 secs.)     Additional toppings for the fajitas can include salsa, sour cream,  avacados, and tomatos.  To me cheese is a sacrilege; but, to each his own.     NOTE:  My grocer carries "fajita tortillas".  These are smaller and  thicker than ones I would use for burritos. They hold up much better with  the fajita filling.     NOTE 2:  If tortillas are not handy, use pita halves.  They work great.  jshearer@beta.tricity.wsu.EDU (Jeff)    AT986@FREENET.CARLETON.CA    (WARD TOMLINSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
