Barbecued Chicken Pizza
Cornmeal, chicken, olive oil, Barbecue sauce, red onion, frozen bread, Yellow bell pepper, Monterey Jack, 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Coat a 15-inch pizza pan with the olive  oil and sprinkle evenly with the cornmeal. Roll out or stretch the dough to  fit the pan. In a medium bowl, combine the chicken and the barbecue sauce.  Spread the mixture into an even layer over the dough. Scatter the bell  pepper and onion over the top and cover with the shredded cheese. Place the  pizza pan on the lowest shelf in an electric oven (or on the floor of a gas  oven) and bake until the crust is firm and nicely browned, 15 to 20  minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm.    Recipe from CHICKEN DINNERS IN ONE POT by Peggy Fallon, ? 1997, used with  permission of HarperCollinsPublishers.
