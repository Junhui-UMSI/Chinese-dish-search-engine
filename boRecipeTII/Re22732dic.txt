Apricot Muffins
Walnuts, Chopped; dried apricots, Liquid egg substitute, Canola oil, Pumpkin pie spice, Skim milk, Egg -or-, Salt, Sugar, Brown sugar, Oatmeal, Flour, Baking Powder, 
I do not use paper liners as the muffins have a tendency to stick to the  paper. Spray tins with non-stick vegetable spray for easy removal and  cleanup.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees    Combine flour, sugars, baking powder, salt, pumpkin pie spice and oatmeal  in a large bowl. Stir in apricots and walnuts. Use a beater to combine  eggs, milk, and oil in a small bowl. Pour liquid into dry ingredients,  stirring just to moisten. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling two-thirds  full. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until muffins are brown.
