COOKING: Preheat oven at  375 degrees. Line roasting pan with foil and place         pork on roasting  rack. Roast a total of 45 minutes,        turning over once or twice.  DO-AHEAD NOTES: Barbecued pork can be made anywhere from a few days to 2  weeks       in advance. Just wrap and freeze. For cold appetizers, thaw,  then slice just before serving. To reheat, thaw      first and reheat in a  slow oven until just heated through (about 20 minutes). Delicious either  way.          COMMENTS: Barbecued pork can be used in fried rice, egg  rolls, filling for steamed pork buns, stir fry         with vegetables and  as garnishes for many noodle dishes.
