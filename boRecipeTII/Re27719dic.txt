Chefs Note:  This soup has been on the menu at the restaurant at The  Mansion on Turtle Creek since it opened in 1985. According to executive  chef Dean Fearing, "When Tortilla Soup is ordered, it is brought to the  table in a tureen for individual service by the waiter, who garnishes each  bowl according to the customers desire."
