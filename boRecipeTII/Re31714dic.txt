Add pine nuts and cook,  stirring constantly until toasted golden brown, about three to four  minutes. Remove from heat, stir in parsley flakes and black pepper and  allow to cool.    Lay swordfish pieces out on counter and divide pine nut mixture among them.  Carefully roll each piece like a jellyroll and secure with a toothpick. In  a 12 to 14-inch oven proof saute pan, heat tomato sauce, chili flakes and  wine until boiling. Place involtini in sauce, well separated and place pan  in oven.
