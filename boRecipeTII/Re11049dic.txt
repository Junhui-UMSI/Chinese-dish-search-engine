Rainbow Cookies
Whole egg, Butter, granulated sugar, Vanilla, Flour, 
Cream butter throughly; add sugars, a little at a time, then egg. Beat well  until very light. Add vanilla. Last, add flour, a small amount at a time.  Dough should not be sticky or heavy. Divide dough into 3 portions. Add  yellow coloring to noe part, green to one part & red to one part. Work  colorings into dough till no white streaks show.    Use 1/4 C of each dough. Roll out each portion of dough between 2 pieces of  wax paper. Put 3 doughs together. Cut uneven parts & roll from the long end  till it resembles a tube. Wrap tightly in wax paper & refrigerate till  firm.    When roll is firm, cut into 1/4 inch slices. Place on lightly greased  baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Bake 325 degrees 15 mins; then shut off  heat and allow cookies to remain in oven, with door slightly ajar for 10  mins more. Watch closely at end, as they lose their color if overbaked.
