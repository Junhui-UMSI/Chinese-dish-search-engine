ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2281    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    For the paupette: Toss all the vegetables with the basil, black olives,  olive oil and salt and pepper. Layer the mixture in the center on one half  side of the parchment. Add the 1 tablespoon of water for steaming purposes.  Fold the other half of parchment over the vegetables resembling a book.  With the crease side toward you start crimping and folding towards your  body. The finish product will resemble a calzone. Make sure that the  parchment is nice and tight, so that none of the liquid will escape. Roast  for 8-10 minutes.    For vinaigrette: In a mixing bowl, slowly whisk the balsamic vinegar into  the olive oil. Add the brunoise of vegetables and season with salt and  pepper. Remove the paupette from the oven and place on a plate. Make a cut  through the top center, exposing the roasted vegetables. Spoon the  vinaigrette over the vegetables and garnish with 2 grilled green onions.    Yield: 4 appetizer servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 19, 1998
