Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste          3    cups mizuna greens    Instructions:    In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter and cook the  shallots until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and fennel and  cook until tender. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in the thyme and  tarragon. Place the mushroom mixture in a bowl and return the pan to the  heat. Pour in the whiskey; avert your face and ignite to burn off the raw  alcohol taste. Stir up the bits from the pan and pour the mixture into the  mushrooms.    To make the custard:?? Preheat the oven to 300 F. Butter six 3-ounce  ramekins. In a deep bowl, combine all the custard ingredients and mix well.  Stir in the mushroom mixture. Pour into the ramekins, filling them to the  top. Place the ramekins in a deep oven-proof dish and fill the dish with  hot water half way up the sides of the ramekins. Cover the entire dish with  foil and poke 6 - 8 holes in the foil. Bake for 20 minutes, until firm.  Remove, and set aside. Keep warm.    To make the asparagus cream:?? In a medium, heavy sauce pan over  medium-high heat, heat the canola oil and saute the shallots, onions, and  leeks until tender, 3 - 4 minutes. Pour in the wine, stir up the browned  bits, and cook until most of the liquid has boiled off. Add the asparagus,  cream, and thyme. Simmer until reduced and slightly thickened, then place  in the bowl of a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Strain  through a fine-meshed sieve into another saucepan. Add salt and pepper to  taste and keep warm.    To make the noodle garnish:?? Place canola oil in a deep fryer and heat to  325 F. Place one sixth of the noodles in a basket tool for frying, and  immerse in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, remove, and place the  basket on paper towels to drain. Repeat to make a total of six cups. (If  you do not have a basket tool, the noodles may be formed into "nests" by  shaping them and holding them in the bowl of a slotted spoon to immerse in  the oil.) In a small saute pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter and  saute the asparagus tips until tender. Season with salt and pepper.    To serve:?? On each of six warm plates, place two tablespoons of asparagus  cream in the center and spread to form 3-inch-diameter circles. Place  asparagus tips at "4:00" on the late with the stems pointed toward the  center. Place a noodle cage in the center of each plate. Unmold the  mushroom custards and place in each cage. Place the oyster mushrooms  against the cages and close to the    continued in part 2
