Brush both sides of bread with melted butter and arrange slices evenly in  the bottom of a buttered 9 x 13" pan. In a large bowl, beat together whole  eggs and egg yolks. Beat in milk, cream and vanilla. Strain this custard  over bread, making sure that each slice is evenly moistened. Bake at 350  for 25 minutes or until custard is set and top lightly browned. Let cool in  the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Cut into squares. Sprinkle with  powdered sugar and serve with berries or other fruit. Servings: 6 to 8.  "The better the bread, the better this dish.  If you can get a good bakery  loaf and cut it into extra thick slices (about 1 inch), you will be  rewarded.  This dish makes a breakfast or brunch into an occasion."
