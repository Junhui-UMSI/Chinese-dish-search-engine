Cover with another paper towel.  Place a plate on top.  Let  stand for about 30 minutes to drain. Cut into cubes. Put the vegetable oil  into a casserole or skillet. Saute the garlic and onion. Chop the green  pepper after removing the seeds. Peel the zucchini. Cut into 1/2" slices.  Combine the garlic and onion with layers of other vegetables. Add pepper  and basil. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables. Bring the mixture to a  boil. Cover. Reduce the heat. Simmer until the vegetables are just tender  (about 25 to 30 minutes). During the cooking, stir occasionally and  carefully so that each vegetable keeps its form. Serve hot or cold.    EAT-L Digest 24 June 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
