Add onions and  carrot and cook over low heat 3 minutes or until onion is soft but not  brown. Add zucchini and cook 2 minutes.    Stir in tomatoes and jalapenos - cook until just heated through.    Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a large, heavy non-stick skillet.  Cook one tortilla at a time until lightly browned, about 30 seconds. Turn  and spoon 1/4 of mixture and 1/4 of goat cheese onto half of the tortilla.  Fold the other tortilla half over the filling. Slide onto warm serving  plate. Repeat with other tortillas and serve immediately.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
