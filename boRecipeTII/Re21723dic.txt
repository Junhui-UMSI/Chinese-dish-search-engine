Combine 1 cup of sugar, chopped nuts and cinnamon in small bowl.  Sprinkle  evenly oveer melted butter.  Arrange apple slices, overlapping slightly.    2. Sift flour, remaining sugar, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Add  shortening, milk, eggs and vanilla.  Beat at low speed, until combined,  then at high speed for 2 minutes. Pour evenly over apples.    3. Bake at 350 F (160 C) for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until top springs  back when lightly pressed with fingertip.    4. Cool in pan on wire rack for 5 minutes. Loosen around edges with a  knife. Cover with a large serving tray or cookie sheet. Turn. Lift off pan.  This came from an issue of either Family Circle or Womans Day over 20  years ago. It has never failed and has never failed to please. The original  recipe calls for the blanched almonds, but I prefer the taste and texture  of walnuts or pecans. I also recommend using Granny Smith apples, and  unsalted margarine can be used in place of vegetable shortening. Butter is  best for the topping. The full quantity of sugar is too much for my taste.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
