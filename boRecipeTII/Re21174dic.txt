Tyropites
Salt, Eggs, All-purpose flour, Butter, Grated nutmeg (or more), Feta cheese; crumbled, Ricotta or cream cheese, Butter, Commercial filo sheets, 
In a bowl combine the cheeses, eggs, flour, salt (unless the feta is very  salty) nutmeg, and 3 tablespoons butter. Cover the bowl and chill several  hours or overnight, removing from the refrigerator an hour before using.  Cut the filo into thirds (3 x 11 inches). Pile up the filo, covering it  with waxed paper and a damp towel. Take out one sheet at a time and keep  the rest covered.  Butter the filo, one sheet at a time, using a pastry  brush and the 1 cup melted butter. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling 1 inch  from the end nearest you. Fold the filo back over the filling so the bottom  edge meets the left edge, forming a right angle. Continue folding back at  right angles to make the triangular shape. Bake in a moderate oven (350  degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once.  Serve hot. Note: Tyropites may be stacked upright in cardboard boxes and  frozen. When ready to bake, separate while still frozen, spread on baking  sheets, and bake as directed above, allowing an additional 10 minutes  baking time.
