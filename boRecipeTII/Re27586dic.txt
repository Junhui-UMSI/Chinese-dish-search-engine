The Best Chocolate Cake
Salt, Baking soda, Vanilla extract, Unbleached White Flour, Cocoa, Warm water, Sugar, Vegetable oil, White vinegar, 
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Wait 10 minutes before starting to  make the cake.  Meanwhile, spray and flour 2 8-inch layer pans.    2.  Thoroughly combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a  bowl.    3. Pour in the water, oil, vanilla, and vinegar and stir until well  combined.  Pour into prepared pans. Bake 30 minutes or until a knife  inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack 10  minutes, then remove the cakes from the pans and cool completely.    4. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.  (Use vegan margarine and a  bit of soy milk instead of butter and milk. )    Good luck!  My daughter is also vegan and coming home on spring break soon.  Think Ill bake her this treat. Thanks for reminding me    Recipe By     : Kay Peterson <ckpeters@TELEPORT.  COM>
