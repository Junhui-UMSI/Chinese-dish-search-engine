Almond Kahlua Truffles
Carob powder plus 2, Toasted coconut, Kahlua; plus I teaspoon, Unlianched almonds; roasted, Instant coffee powder, Shredded coconut, Egg yolk, 
The ultimate taste treat! The rich, exotic coffee flavor of Kahlua blends  with the crunch of toasted almonds and coconut to make an outrageously  good, no-bake confection. Make double the recipe-they freeze well.    Roast the almonds in a 3500F oven for 10 minutes. In food processor or  blender, grind the almonds to the consistency of coarse crumbs. Add the 3  tablespoons of carob, the coffee, coconut, and egg yolk, and 2 tablespoons  of the Kahlua. Blend until all ingredients are incorporated.    Scoop up about 1/2 teaspoon of the mixture at a time and roll between palms  into a ball the size of a marble. Skewer on a toothpick, then roll each  marble first in the remaining Kahlua, then in the remaining carob powder,  and finally the toasted coconut. If you have any left after the usual raid  by the kitchen kibitzers, refrigerate or freeze them until company comes.  Yield: 24 truffles.
