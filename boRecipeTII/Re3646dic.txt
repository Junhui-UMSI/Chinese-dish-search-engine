Pegleg Shortys Chili
Camino, Suet -- ground, Water, Salt, Lean beef -- ground coarse, Cayenne pepper, Garlic powder, Chili powder, Oregano, Paprika, 
Braise the meat in a large skillet.  Add the water and bring to a boil. Add  the ground suet and all the spices. Mix thoroughly. Stir every few minutes  till your are sure the spices are blended and the meat is all well  spearated. After that you just need to stir enough to keep it from sticking  to the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 45 minutes to one hour.    from the "LBJ Barbecue Cook Book" by Walter Jetton, Caterer to the LBJ  Ranch  Shared by Al Martin BTW, I bought this book when it first came out  in 1965 for the list price of $1.00. Would not sell it today at any price.    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
