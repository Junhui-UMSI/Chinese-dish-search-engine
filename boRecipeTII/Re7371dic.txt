Pork Chops with Apples
Sherry, Brown sugar, Granny Smith apples; peeled, White pepper; to taste, Pork Chops, Hot water, Onion; sliced thin, Beef bouillon granules, Fresh mushrooms, olive oil, Cornstarch; mixed in water, 
Remove fat from pork chops. In a large, non-stick skillet, saute onion and  mushrooms in olive oil. Remove. Brown chops in the oil. Dissolve bouillon  granules in hot water. Add to skillet. Add sherry . Bring to a boil, cover,  reduce heat. Simmer for 25 minutes. Add apples; simmer for 10 more minutes.  Carefully remove everything from skillet to a serving dish except liquid.  Thicken liquid with cornstarch. Pour over meat.    Serving Ideas : Serve with rice and sauteed cabbage    NOTES : The original recipe called for cooking chops 20 minutes and apples  another 15.  I thought this was too long.  Apples should not turn to mush.  I used manzanillo sherry.   Maybe should have used a fino or an oloroso.  The original recipe did not have sherry, but well.....  Also it had  raisins, but I left them out.  Recipe by: Lou Parris    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #830 by Lou Parris <lbparris@earthlink.net>  on Oct 07, 1997
