In a large bowl, combine chicken, garlic, oregano, olive oil, vinegar,  prunes, apricots, bay leaves, olives, capers and caper juice. Cover and  refrigerate 24 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange chicken in a  single layer in a shallow baking pan and spoon marinade evenly over  chicken.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and pour Chardonnay around chicken.  Bake 45 minutes, basting every 15-20 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove  chicken, fruit, olives, and capers to a serving platter. Pour several  spoonfuls of pan juices over chicken. Serve remaining pan juices in a sauce  boat. Any dry white wine may be substituted for Chardonnay.    *Use 1/4 cup brown sugar to start off with, I think 1/2 cup brown sugar may  be a bit too much.
