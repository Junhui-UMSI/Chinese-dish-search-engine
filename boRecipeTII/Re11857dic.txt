Razorback Potatoes
Paprika, as garnish, Butter or margarine, Dry bread crumbs, Baking potatoes, 3 inches, Salt and pepper, to taste, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Preheat oven to 450. Generously grease a large shallow baking dish; set  aside. Peel potatoes to a uniform size. Starting at one end, cut 1/4 inch  slices without cutting all the way through to the bottom(slices will fan  out slightly). Place potatoes in baking dish, cut-edge up. Sprinkle with  salt and pepper to taste. Dot with butter. Bake for 20 minutes, basting  occasionally with butter from bottom of dish. Meanwhile, in a small bowl,  mix parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Remove the potatoes from oven.  Sprinkle cheese-bread crumb mixture between potato slices and over top.  Bake 25-30 minutes longer without basting, or until golden brown and  tender. Sprinkle with paprika. Serves 6.
