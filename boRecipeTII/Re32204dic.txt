Barbecued Short Ribs
:Water, or enough to, Cayenne pepper, Chicken broth, Chili powder, Catsup, Short ribs (or chicken), Tomato paste, Worcestershire Sauce, Brown sugar, Cider vinegar, Dry mustard, Ground cloves, 
THE DAY BEFORE GRILLING THE RIBS, put the sugar and vinegar in a pot large  enough to hold the ribs and place over medium heat on top of the stove.  Cook until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the sugar, about 8  minutes. Watch carefully, as the syrup will suddenly darken in color.  Immediately add the broth, water, catsup, tomato paste, mustard,  Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and pepper and bring to a boil. Add  the ribs and cook 20 minutes. (If using chicken, cook for 10 minutes.)  Remove from heat, remove the ribs from the liquid and place covered in the  refrigerator. Cook the liquid over medium heat until it becomes thick and  syrupy. The next day, light a charcoal grill. Place the ribs on the grill  so they are not directly over the coals and cover the grill so that smoke  collects inside. If your grill does not have a cover, improvise one out of  aluminium foil. Cook for 40 minutes, basting with barbecue sauce every 10  minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to a platter and serve. Offer  any additional barbecue sauce on the side.
