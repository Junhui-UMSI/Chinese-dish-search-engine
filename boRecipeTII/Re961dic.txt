In a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a rapid boil over high heat.  Throw your sweet potatoes in and cook until they can be pierced fairly  easily with a fork but still offer a good amount of resistance, 8 to 10  minutes. Drain the potatoes, rinse with cold water, and refrigerate until  chilled, at least 30 minutes.    In a medium bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients, and mix well. Add  the chilled sweet potatoes, toss well to coat, and serve.
