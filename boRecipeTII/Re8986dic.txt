Here is an unusal recipe for a cross between soft pretzel and a roll. The  technique may remind you of bagel making!    Combine flour, yeast, salt, sugar and celery seeds and add enough water to  form a smooth elastic dough . This may be done by hand or food processor.  If using the food processor, process all one minute or so and if done by  hand knead dough 5 minutes or until smooth , soft and pliable dough. Let  dough rise double in a greased covered bowl.When double, punch down and  divide into 8 pieces, rolling each piece into a ball. Using a serrated  knife, cut an " X "  in top center of each ball. Cover with a tea towel and  let rise double. Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and add the baking soda  and sugar ( water will foam ). Carefully place 4 rolls in the water and  cook 30 seconds. Lift out with slotted spoon and place on a cornmeal lined  baking sheet. Repeat with remaining rolls. Brush rolls with an egg white  glaze ( 1 white mixed with a tsp+ of water ) and sprinkle with coarse salt  if desired. Bake in a preheated 35 oven till browned, about 20 to 25  minutes. Cool on rack 10 minutes before serving. Note: boiling of rolls  must be done to insure the soft pretzel like texture. Best served warm and  the day made. May freeze if desired. Yummy with honey mustard!    makes 8    Joan,"Flour Power" >From: LIR119@delphi.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
