Thai Cucumber
Cucumber, Vinegar, white, Sugar, Salt, White pepper, Onion, Red chile pepper, Peanuts, 
Julienne the cucumber on a mandolin, or slice thinly.  In a deep bowl stir the vinegar, sugar, salt and white pepper until well-blended.      Peel onion, slice into lengthwise paper thin slices. Same with seeded red  chile pepper.    Add the remaining ingredients, except the peanuts, and toss with the  marinade.      Serve at once or cover and chill NO LONGER than 2 hours.      Top with the peanuts (whole or chopped) just before serving. Makes 1 cup    * Personal Note - liked sliced cucumber much better.      Variations to try: thin slice onion and cucumber  instead of julienne and increase vinegar to 2 tbls.    If regular salted peanuts are used, omit salt in marinate.
