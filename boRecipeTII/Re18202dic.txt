Venison Espagnole Sauce
Venison stock, Onion, celery, Carrot, Thyme, Tomato paste, butter, flour, Bay leaf, 
yields about 2 quarts    Method:  In a pot large enough to hold everything, saute vegetables in  butter until tender, add thyme.  Add flour all at once, stirring well to  mix.  Dont worry if the vegetables are broken in the process.  Cook until  raw smell is gone, 5 to 8 minutes.  Whisk-in stock, tomato puree and bay  leaf and simmer for at least 2 1/2 hours, skimming as necessary. Strain out  solids as above and cool.    Espagnole sauce is usually made with beef, but this one is equally  full-bodied and satisfying.
