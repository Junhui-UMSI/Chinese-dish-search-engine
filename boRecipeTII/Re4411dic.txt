Pesach Pancakes
Oil for frying, Sugar, Warm milk, Eggs, Matza meal, Salt, 
The recipe is from a cookbook called The Passover Gourmet by Nira Rousso    Heat the milk and add the matza meal. Put aside and let rest for 10 min.  Beat the eggs and add to the matza mix. Add salt and sugar and mix well.  Heat a little oil in a frying pan and droop spoonfuls of batter into hot  oil. Fry as pancakes.    We like eating this with soft white cheese and vegetables but you can blend  strawberries with sugar and put on top.
