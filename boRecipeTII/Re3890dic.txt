Brush each chicken breast with 1 teaspoon of olive oil; sprinkle  each portion with 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning; set aside.         In a large non-stick frypan, place the remaining olive oil, and  heat over medium flame.         Add chicken and cook, turning, for about 10 minutes or until the  chicken is brown on all sides.  Remove the chicken and keep warm.         To the same frypan, add the onion, and cook for 3 minutes or  until the onion is slightly tender.  Add ginger root during the last  minute of cooking.         Next, stir in the vinegar; increase heat if necessary and boil  until vinegar almost evaporates.         Add pepper jelly and cook until the jelly melts.         Add broth to the pan; return the chicken to the pan and cook,  turning, about 5 minutes or until sauce is reduced and chicken is  glazed.         Arrange the cooked chicken on a serving platter and pour the  remaining sauce over it.         Garnish with Jalapeno peppers.         Cook:  Julie P.
