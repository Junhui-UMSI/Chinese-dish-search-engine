Vegetable stock, Pepper, Onion, Salt, Vinegar, Dry bread crumbs, Soy sauce, Catsup, Beef, Egg, Brown sugar, 
1. Remove fat and tendons from beef; then mince or grind. Mince onion and  add to beef.    2. Beat egg lightly and add, along with bread crumbs, salt and pepper.  Blend well, but do not overhandle meat. Form into walnut-size balls.    3. Heat stock to boiling. Add beef balls a few at a time (to keep  temperature of stock from dropping too rapidly) and simmer, covered, until  done (about 30 minutes).    4. Meanwhile, combine brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and catsup.    5. Transfer meatballs to a serving platter. Leave stock in pan and add  sugar-soy mixture. Cook, stirring, over medium flame, to blend and heat.  Pour sauce over beef balls and serve.    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.
