Baba Ghanoush (Arnold)
Tahini, Parsley, Finely Chopped, Garlic Cloves, peeled, olive oil, Salt and pepper, Aubergines, Lemon, 
Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/375F/190C. Prick the skins of the aubergines  with a carving fork and bake in the oven for one hour, or until flesh is  soft. Remove and allow to cool so you can handle them without burning your  hands. Cut in half and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Mash with a fork.  You may prefer to use a food processor, but i like the rough finish  achieved with a fork.    Crush the garlic cloves with a hard blow from your hand on the back of a  large sharp knife and then chop the pulp finely. Add this, along with the  tahini, lemon juice and parsley, to the aubergine. Stir everything  thoroughly, and add enough olive oil to give a rich thick consistency.  Season with salt and pepper and serve with warm slices of pitta bread or  hot toast.
