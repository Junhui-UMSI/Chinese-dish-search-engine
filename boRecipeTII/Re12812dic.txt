Stir to combine thoroughly. Simmer the mixture until it is very thick and  almost sticking to the pan.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground  pepper, a Tablespoon of sugar and 3 Tablespoons lemonjuice. Cool and chill.  Serve on greens with a garnish of the yolks and whites of 2 hardboiled  eggs, chopped separately, chopped onion, chopped parsley, then drizzle  olive oil over the top and garnish with paper-thin lemon slices. This is a  delicious appetizer and a very good spread for bread or crisp toast." I  served it on french bread without any garnishes and I picture it on  focaccia sprinkled with sesame seeds and parsley or maybe a wee bit of  lemon basil.  And I used my processor where appropriate.
