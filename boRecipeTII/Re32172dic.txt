So, I  told her that I would do it for her:    1. Cook noodles in plenty of boiling water, when al dente, drain and toss  with sesame oil, set aside    2. Combine sauce ingredients, set aside    3. Heat wok, add oil, Add ginger stir fry until fragrant (about 10 sec) add  bok choy, bean sprouts and pork, Stir fry 2 min    4. Add broth then when broth is hot add noodles, cover and cook 2 min    5. Add sauce, stir well and serve Varriations, instead of pork, use left  over cooked, roast beef, lamb, shrimp or chicken, other fresh vegtables in  season can be used in place of the sprouts and bok choy    From "Dim Sum" by Ruth Laws 8 oz lo mein noodles JANE HARRIS (DXDG05A)    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #84    From the MasterCook recipe list.
