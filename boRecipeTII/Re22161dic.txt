Turkey Picatta
Lemon juice, freshly, Egg whites, beaten, Clove garlic, crushed, Margarine (or sub Butter, Fresh bread crumbs, Turkey cutlets, pounded thin, Chicken Stock, 
Dip pounded cutlets in egg white, then into bread crumbs. Brown cutlets in  a non stick pan sprayed with non stick spray, 2 at a time. Brown garlic for  1 - 2 minutes. After all are browned, add lemon juice and scrape brown bits  off pan bottom. Add chicken broth and margarine (or Butter Buds). Cover and  cook about 20 minutes or until fork tender.    NOTES : Can add garlic right after chicken is cooked.  Can use 1 whole egg  instead of whites and substitute fresh bread crumbs for dried. (These notes  are by the original poster. I do not know how it affects the CFF%.)    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n259    Recipe by: Terry    From: cbmcam@cyberramp.net    Date: Sat, 28 Dec 1996 20:23:21 -0600
