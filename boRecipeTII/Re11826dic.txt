Harissa; recipe follows, Capers; drained, Artichokes, Chopped mint, Lemon juice, olive oil, Water, Tomato peeled; seeded, and, DRESSING, Salt, 
Make dressing: In a bowl, combine the harissa, water, salt, and lemon  juice. Whisk in the olive oil and set aside.    Prepare the artichokes by removing the leaves and choke. Remove the stem,  and pare off any hard green parts for the bottom of the artichoke. Put in  acidulated water to prevent discoloration. Using a madoline or very sharp  knife, thinly slice the artichoke bottoms and toss with the dressing. Let  marinate for 15 minutes.    Divide the artichokes among four plates, and sprinkle with the capers,  mint, and garnish with finely diced tomato.
