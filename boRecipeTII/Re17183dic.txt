Add rest of milk and  custard powder according to package directions. Serve warm or cold in a  soup plate with tart-flavoured berries. You can also swirl in thinned  chocolate pudding for a nice effect.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /MISC    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
