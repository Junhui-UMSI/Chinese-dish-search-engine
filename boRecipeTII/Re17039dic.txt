Vietnamese Pork Burgers
Sugar, Or so roasted peanuts,, Lean ground pork, Garlic cloves, chopped, Handful cilantro, coarsely, Peanut or other mild, Few drops Tabasco sauce, or, Green onions, chopped, Whole lettuce leaves, Soy sauce, Hoisin sauce, 
This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,  the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form.  All  these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.  Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and  texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,  each of which balances these assertive flavors.    Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and  Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked  through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped  in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.    Makes 4 servings.

NOTE: In the body of the accompanying article, the author suggests  using pita bread lightly spread with hoisin and putting the patties  into it along with some of the cabbage salad.  Thats probably the  way Id go.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; October 31 1992.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip
