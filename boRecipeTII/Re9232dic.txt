Pseudo-Melindas Habanero Pepper Sauce
Garlic, minced, White vinegar, Carrots, chopped, Habaneros, stemmed but, Lime juice, Water, Onion, olive oil, 
Saute onions and garlic in oil over medium low heat until soft but not  brown. Add carrots and water. Bring to boil, reduce to low and cook  until carrots are cooked. Remove this mixture to a blender and blend  along with the Habaneros. When smooth, mix in vinegar and lime juice  and simmer briefly. If you are looking to use the sauce immediately,  simmer for 5 min; if you are going to store it, 2 min will be  sufficient but will increase the heat of the sauce to about Melindas  xxtra sauce heat. You may up to double the Habs before creating a  painfully hot sauce (about as hot as Melindas reserve) In any case,  this stuff should be packed into sterilized containers for storage  unless you want to drink it up all at once, heh heh.
