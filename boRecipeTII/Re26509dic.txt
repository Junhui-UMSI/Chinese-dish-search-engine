Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Poppers
fresh jalapeno, cream cheese, Bacon, 
Split, seed and wash jalapeno peppers. Spread cream cheese in each half of  split peppers, either leave in halves *OR* combine the two halves to make a  whole popper. Wrap each half/whole jalapeno with a bacon slice cut in half.    Place each bacon wrapped jalapeno on a cookie sheet..bake at 250 til bacon  is done, cool and serve.(Cheese will boil out if oven is set to high)    This is even better cold the next day!!! I should have posted these for Super bowl Sunday...good with beer,wine and margaritas.      *I have used fat free and low fat cream cheese, the amount varies as to how  much cheese each individual likes in their jalapeno.   **I use Turkey bacon  for the wrap and it is really good, less fat too.
