Beat eggs in large bowl; set aside. Cook contents of package as directed  except remove from heat after rice has simmered 5 minutes. Stir in milk and  green onions. Gradually add to beaten eggs, stirring constantly. Melt  butter in 10-inch non-stick skillet; tilt to coat bottom and sides. Add  egg-rice mixture and cook over moderately low heat. When eggs begin to set,  lift edges with spatula and tilt skillet to allow uncooked egg to run  underneath. Cover and continue to cook until top is almost set. Sprinkle  cheese over top. Remove from heat. Cover and let stand until cheese melts,  about 5 minutes. Garnish with tomato slices, if desired. Cut into wedges to  serve.
