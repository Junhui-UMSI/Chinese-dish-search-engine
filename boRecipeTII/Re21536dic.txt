Apple Pie Waffles
Skim milk, Apples; grated, Applesauce, Wheat bran, Egg whites or egg replacer, Water, Honey, Dry yeast, Apple pie spice, Whole wheat flour; fine, 
In a 2 quart measuring bowl or other utensil that will pour easily, mix  flour, bran, salt and spice; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine yeast,  water, and honey, and let rest 5 minutes while peeling, coring, and grating  apple. Add grated apples, applesauce, milk, and egg whites to yeast  mixture; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients. Cover and let rest for 15  minutes. Pour about 1 cup of batter into a hot waffle iron* and cook for 7  ~ 8 minutes, or until the lid lifts easily.    Pancakes:    Pour about 1/2 cup of batter onto a medium-hot, nonstick griddle and  flatten cakes so the enter will cook. Cook about 10 minutes on first side,  about 6 - 8 minutes on the other side. Dont turn until bubbles form on  top. These cakes are thicker than regular pancakes and take longer to cook.    NOTES : * Lightly oil a nonstick waffle iron before heating to prevent  sticking.  To keep warm before serving, place cooked waffles in a warm oven  on a bare oven rack.
