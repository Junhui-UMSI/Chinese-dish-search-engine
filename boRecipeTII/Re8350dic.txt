Source : shall we say traditional?    Serves : about 12 buffet servings    1. Boil unpeeled potatoes and eggs in uncovered pot. When boiling, continue  to heat until potatoes can be pierced with fork easily. Remove from heat,  pour water and cover with cold water.    2. Peel eggs and potatoes. Cube.    3. Mix potatoes, eggs, sieved can contents. Add salt and then mayo. Salad  should be very "pasty".    4. Before serving, turn over from bowl into serving dish (can be done in  any fancy shaped bowl). If done correctly, salad will hold its shape.    5. Garnish with chopped parsley or stoned olives or really anything (since  the color is off-white, any garnish looks good on it).
