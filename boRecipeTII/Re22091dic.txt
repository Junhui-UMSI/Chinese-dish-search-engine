Turkey in Green Chile
Recipe blended red chile, 2-lb turkey hindquarter; or, olive oil, 
I assume that a Southwest Indian cook would prepare a meal in this  manner. It is a new way to understand turkey, and it is about time we  understood the "old bird."      In a covered Dutch oven, brown the defrosted hindquarter in the oil. Add  the sauce and simmer, covered, until the meat is tender, about 1 hour.      Serve this along with Baked Pumpkin and Onions (see recipe) and you will  have a very nice Santa Fe meal.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
