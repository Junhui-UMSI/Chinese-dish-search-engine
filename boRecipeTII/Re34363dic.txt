Stir about every 15 minutes for the ENTIRE time the beans are cooking.    After the beans have been cooking for about 1 hour and 45 minutes chop the  onion and celery and carrots. Slice the four slices of bacon into 1"  squares.  Saute the onion, celery and bacon squares in the olive oil for  about 10 minutes.
