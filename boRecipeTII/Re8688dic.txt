Poudre De Colombo (Caribbean Curry Spice)
Fresh hot red chilies, Ground coriander, Ground mustard, Garlic, Ground turmeric, 
Colombo is a type of curry found in the Caribbean islands of Martinique and  Guadeloupe. Although called a powder, this recipe, based on one in The Best  of Caribbean Cooking by Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, is in fact a paste.    Peel and crush the garlic; remove the seeds from the chilies and mash.  Combine all the ingredients and mix to a paste. Store in the refrigerator  for up to 6 weeks.
