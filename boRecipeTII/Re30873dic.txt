Tangy Mushroom Miso Gravy
Fresh ground black pepper, Water, Balsamic vinegar, Celery seed, Cornstarch, Water, Nutritional yeast, Tamari, Mushrooms, Brown rice miso, 
Wash and slice the mushrooms.  Saute mushrooms with the balsamic vinegar in  a large skillet until fully cooked. Remove mushrooms from skillet and set  aside. Keep the mushroom liquid in the skillet.    Add 3 cups water, miso, tamari, and nutritional yeast to the skillet. Whisk  until thoroughly blended and simmer for a few minutes. Add celery seed and  black pepper to taste. Add mushrooms.    Mix together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a cup. Make sure the  cornstarch is fully dissolved.  With skillet over medium heat, add the  cornstarch suspension to the gravy a little at a time. Stir continually.  When gravy reaches desired thickness, cook for a minute longer and then  serve immediately.    Note:  If you want to make this ahead, make up the miso-mushroom mixture as  described but do not add cornstarch. When you are ready to serve it, heat  up the miso-mushroom mixture and thicken before serving.    Makes 4 cups.
