Toasted Pumpkin Seeds #2
Salt, Pumpkin seed, 
From: colello@ruf.rice.edu (Robert Scott Colello)    Date: Sat, 23 Oct 93 00:02:01 CDT    My favorite snack for Thanksgiving or Halloween is toasted pumkin seeds.  Scoop seeds from pumpkin.  Separate seeds from pulp and rinse, you may have  to pick them out by hand. Drain and dry seeds, put seeds on cookie tray or  toaster tray.  Sprinkle with salt.  Toast at 300 F (Im not sure about  this). Turn once. Seeds should be dry and barely turn golden brown. Some  seeds will puff up. These are similar to sunflower seeds and have a nice  nutty flavor, but the shells are harder to crack open if they are small.  ~teg@owlnet.rice.edu    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
