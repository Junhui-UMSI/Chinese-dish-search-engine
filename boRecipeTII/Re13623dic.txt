Set aside.    To prepare the chile filling, marinate cleaned mushrooms in lemon juice,  olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Meanwhile, cut the  sweet corn from the cob and place in a small bowl with queso blanco that  has been grated or cut into small cubes. Grill mushrooms and allow to cool.  Cut mushrooms into medium cubes and add to corn and queso blanco mixture.  Finish seasoning with cilantro, salt and pepper.    To stuff chilies first lightly salt and pepper the inside of each. Spoon  about 3-4 tablespoons mixture into each. Close chilies and wrap tightly in  plastic. To cook chile relleno steam for 8-10 minutes. Remove from plastic,  sauce plate and place Chile Relleno on top. Optional: Drizzle lightly with  Cilantro Oil.
