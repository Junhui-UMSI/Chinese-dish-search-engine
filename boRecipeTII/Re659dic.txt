Grind to a fine powder in a coffee  grinder. BEWARE of the fumes while grinding!    In a large pot, saute venison in oil until no pink remains. Add onion and  garlic and sauce until onion is wilted.  Add tomatoes, undrained. Add  remaining spices except habanero powder.    Simmer on low for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
