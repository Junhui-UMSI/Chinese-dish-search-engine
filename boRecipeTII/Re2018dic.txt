Preheat fryer to 350 degrees or place enough oil in a heavy saute pan to  come half way up the side of the pan. Heat the oil until a fry thermometer  registers 350 degrees. In a large bowl place the ice cubes, club soda, and  beer, let it sit for 2 hours. Strain out any remaining ice cubes. Place the  flour and salt in a medium bowl. While stirring gently, add enough of the  beer mixture to the flour so that a thick batter is made. You want the  batter thick enough to stick to the shrimp. Fold in the beaten egg whites.    Dredge the shrimp in the 1/4 cup of flour, shaking off excess flour and dip  them into the batter. Deep fry the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp  and golden, drain on a towel, and serve with the tartar sauce, parsley, and  lemon wedges.    This recipe yields 2 servings.
