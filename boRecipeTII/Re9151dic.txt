Provencal Potatoes with Tomatoes
olive oil, All-purpose potato; scrubbed, Tomato paste, Salt, Parmesan cheese, Black Pepper, Chopped flat-leaf parsley, Plum tomato, 
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 400F. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil and  tomato paste. Add the potato slices, tossing to cover evenly. In an 8-inch  ovenproof skillet, layer the potatoes around the outside and in the center.  Slide the tomato slices evenly between the sliced potato. Season lightly  with salt and pepper, and heat the pan on top of the stove at medium-high  heat until crackling noises are heard, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer the  pan to the oven to bake until the slices are slightly crisp and the potato  is tender when pierced with a knife, about 25 minutes. Remove, sprinkle on  the Parmesan cheese and run the dish under the broiler just until the  cheese is lightly colored, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, watching carefully. Remove  and sprinkle on the parsley, and serve.
