White Fish with Tuscan Beans
Lemon juice, Fish, olive oil, Fresh sage leaves, Salt, TUSCAN BEANS, Italian stewed tomatoes  , Fresh sage leaves, Garlic, black pepper, white beans  , FISH, olive oil, 
*Use any meaty white or light fish, such as white sturgeon, halibut, or  swordfish    1. To prepare the beans: In a medium saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil  over medium heat. Put the garlic into the oil and saute 1 minute. Stir in  the undrained tomatoes, white beans, sage and a few grinds black pepper.  Simmer gently 10 minutes, stirring often. Keep warm.    2. To prepare the fish: In a small jar, combine the lemon juice, olive oil,  sage, salt and pepper. Close jar and shake to blend.    3. Place the fish on a rack in a foil-lined baking pan. Poke a few holes in  the fish with a skewer and spoon on about half of the lemon mixture. Bake  in a preheated 450-degree oven 12 minutes per inch of thickness, or until  just cooked through. (Overcooking a meaty white fish will cause it to  toughen.)    4. Spoon a couple tablespoons of the cooking liquid that has been given off  by the fish into the beans. Remove the skin and bones from the fish and cut  into large chunks.    5. Spoon the beans onto serving plates and top with chunks of the fish.  Drizzle the remaining lemon mixture over the fish.
