TO SEASON CHICKEN: Combine seasoning mix ingredients in small bowl.  Sprinkle all surfaces of chicken evenly with 2 teaspoons seasoning  mix. Rub it in well.  Dissolve cornstarch in 1/4 cup apple juice. Set  aside.      Preheat heavy 10-inch skillet, preferably non-stick, over high heat  to 350 degrees for about 4 minutes.  Place 4 chicken breasts in  skillet. Lower heat to medium.  Brown for at least 1 minute per side.  Remove chicken. Brown 4 more.  Set all the chicken aside.      Return heat to high.  Stir in 1/2 cup stock, scraping bottom of  skillet to clear it of all browned bits.  Add onions and remaining  seasoning mix. Stir.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all liquid  evaporates. Stir in 1/4 of lemon juice.  Scrape bottom of skillet  again to clear it. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until liquid  evaporates. Add 1/2 cup apple juice. Clear bottom and side of  skillet. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until about half of the liquid  evaporates.      Stir in remaining 1 cup of stock, the 1/4 cup lemon juice and the  1/4 cup apple juice.  Bring to a boil (will take 2 to 3 minutes),  whisk in the cornstarch-apple juice mixture, and return to a boil.  Return the chicken to the skillet, lower the heat to medium, and cook  until the chicken is done all the way through, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn off the heat, remove the chicken, and if desired, whisk in the  artificial sweetener.      Makes 4 servings.
