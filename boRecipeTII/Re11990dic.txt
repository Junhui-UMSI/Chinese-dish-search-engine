Red and Yellow Tomato Soup
Red tomatoes, Yellow tomatoes, Jack cheese, Salt, Freshly grated dry, 
Cut red tomatoes into 1/2-in dice and place in bowl. Cut yellow tomatoes in  1/2-in dice and place in separate bowl. Sprinkle each with a pinch of salt;  set aside for 20 minutes.    Keeping red and yellow tomatoes separate, pass each through a food mill.  Then pass red and yellow purees separately through a fine sieve, pressing  with back of a ladle.    Pour each puree into a separate pan and bring to a boil just before  serving. Season each to taste with salt. Using two ladles, one in each  hand, scoop equal amounts of red and yellow tomato soup and simultaneously  pour into warm bowls. Garnish with Jack cheese.    Notes: This soup is on the menu of Echo in Fresno, CA. It is completely  dependent upon the quality of the tomatoes you have. They should be very  ripe, but if you have mediocre tomatoes, you will have mediocre soup.    CDR   10/1/97  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #259 by Carole <caroleru@tp.net> on Oct 01,  1997
