from <<Faye Levys International Jewish Cookbook>>    Green peas peek out of these golden brown eastern European-style pancakes,  which also contain mushrooms, onion & carrot. The pancakes are delicious on  their own, but the dill sour cream turns them into a special treat.    Mix sour cream & dill. Season to taste with salt & pepper. Set aside at  room temperature.    Separate mushroom stems & caps. Halve both length-wise & cut into thin  slices. Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion  & saute 5 minutes. Add mushrooms & celery & saute 8 minutes or until  vegetables are tender. Let cool, then transfer to a bowl. Stir in grated  carrot. Add peas, eggs, salt, pepper, dill & 2 tbsp matzoh meal. Mix well.  If mixture appears watery, add additional matzoh meal.    Heat remaining oil in a deep, heavy skillet. For each pancake, drop 1  heaping tbsp of mixture into pan. Flatten slightly with back of spoon & fry  over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden  brown. Turn carefully using two spatulas. Drain on paper towels. Stir  mixture before frying each batch. Add a little more oil if necessary. Serve  hot, accompanied by dill sour cream.
