Top Secret Mrs. Fields Peanut Butter Dream Bars
Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chip, Peanut butter, Butter, Powdered sugar, Milk-chocolate chips, 
Preheat the oven to 350~.    Crumble the cookies into a medium mixing bowl.  Add the melted butter;  stir until the mixture darkens and the butter is evenly mixed in. Pour the  mixture into a ungreased 9x9" baking pan.  Press the dough down solidly  into the pan and bake for 10 minutes, or until firm around edges. When  done, cool in the refrigerator.    Mix the peanut butter and sugar until blended.  The mixture should have a  doughy texture that allows you to knead it with your hands. Melt the  chocolate chips in a double boiler over low heat, stirring often. You may  also melt them in a microwave oven set on high for 2 minutes, stirring  halfway through the heating time.    When the dough is cool, spread half of the melted chocolate over the  surface.  Cool in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes, or until hardened.  Spread the peanut butter mixture evenly over the surface of the chocolate.   Spread the remaining chocolate over the peanut butter, covering to the  edges of the pan.  Cool the finished product in the refrigerator or let it  sit at room temperature until hardened.  Slice into five even rows and then  once down the middle.
