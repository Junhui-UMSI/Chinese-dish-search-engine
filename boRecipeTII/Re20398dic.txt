Recipe By: The Encyclopedia of Italian Cooking    Sift the flour onto a work surface and make a well in the center. Add the  yeast and salt and work together with the fingertips. Add lukewarm water  gradually, kneading until a smooth, pliable dough is obtained. Shape into a  ball and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with a little flour and cover with a  damp cloth. Leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled  in bulk.    Knead the dough on a floured surface, then shape into small sticks, about  1/2 inch thick and 2 1/2 inches long. Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer and  deep-fry the sticks, a few at a time, until golden brown. Drain on  absorbent kitchen paper and keep warm while frying the remainder.    Put the honey in a saucepan and heat gently until it has melted stirring  constantly. Dip the sticks into the honey to coat and serve immediately.
