Strawberry Bavarian
Cold water, Egg whites, Env unflavored gelatin; 1 tb, Strawberries; sliced/hulled, Sugar, Whipping cream, 
Place berries and sugar in a bowl. Partially crush berries with a fork or  potato masher (there should be some berry chunks); set aside.   In a 1-qt pan, stir together gelatin and water; let stand for 5 min or  until gelatin has softened. Stir in strawberry mixture. Bring just to a  boil, stirring constantly. Pour into a large bowl and let cool thoroughly  until mixture is thick but not set. In another bowl, beat egg whites until  soft peaks form. Fold beaten egg whites into strawberry mixture. In the  same bowl you just beat whites, whip cream; fold into strawberry mixture.  Pour into 6 dessert glasses. Cover and refrigerate for at LEAST 4 hours or,  better yet, until the next day.
