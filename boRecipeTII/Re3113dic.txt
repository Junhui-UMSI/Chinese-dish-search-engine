Saute until tender and onions barely browned, about 8-10 minutes Meanwhile,  dissolve sugar in fish sauce or soy sauce and tamarind liquid or lime  juice.  When onion is browned, add soy sauce mixture and 1/2 cup coconut  milk to pan.  Stir in peanut butter and cook 5 minutes longer,stirring  frequently to prevent sticking. Remove pan from heat and let cool enough to  taste.  It should be pleasantly hot, but balanced by the sweetness of the  sugar, the cooling coconut milk and the tart flavor of the tamarind. Adjust  seasoning accordingly.  Stir in chopped cilantro and serve warm or at room  temp. If it is too thick, thin with coconut milk or water.  Garnish with  more cilantro.
