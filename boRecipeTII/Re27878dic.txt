Thick Oven-Fried Potatoes
Potato, Pepper, Salt, PAM, 
Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-inch thick slices; cut slices into  1/2-inch thick sticks the length of the potatoes. Arrange potatoes in a  single layer on 2 ungreased 12x15-inch rimmed baking pans. Spray with PAM.  Bake, uncovered, in a 400 degree oven, turning over with a spatula as  needed, until evenly browned and crisp, about 1 hour. Sprinkle lightly with  salt and pepper. Serve hot.
