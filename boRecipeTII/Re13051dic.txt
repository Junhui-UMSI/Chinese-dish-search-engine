** See recipes for Chicken Stock.         In a large saucepan or casserole, heat up the butter over  medium-low heat.  Add the onion, leek, celery, garlic and jalapeno  chili.  Cook, covered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.         Add the carrots, cabbage, potatoes, turnips, fennel, kohlrabi,  celery root, broccoli, parsley, and enough stock to nearly cover.  Bring the contents to a boil; lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30  minutes or until very tender.         Puree the soup, working in batches as necessary, in a processor  or blender.  Rinse out the pan, pour the soup back into the saucepan,  and bring the soup to a simmer.  Add cream and salt and pepper to  taste; heat back up to simmer.  Serve with garnish of sour cream and  chives.    NOTE:  =====         At Thanksgiving dinner at The Four Seasons, this soup is served in  a hollowed-out acorn squash.  To serve it this way, slice off the tops  and a thin sliver from the bottom of the acorn squash (this is so the  squash can "sit up" on its own) then hollow out the insides.         Pour in the finished soup and bake on a baking sheet, uncovered,  at 375 F until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes.  The squash  will be tender enough to be scraped from the shell and eaten with the  soup.         The vegetables in this soup can be varied according to what is  in season, as long as you maintain the proportion of solids to liquid.
