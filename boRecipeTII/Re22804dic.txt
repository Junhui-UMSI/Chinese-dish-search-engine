A very  popular fruit square thats baked in two layers.  Be sure to start the  apricots for the topping before you make the base so they can cool.    Butter an 8 x 8 inch pan.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cream the butter  with the sugar, add the flour and the vanilla, blending well, then press  into the bottom of the pan. Bake for 20 minutes.    Topping: Boil the apricots for about ten minutes in water to cover, drain  and cool.  Combine the eggs with the brown sugar and beat until light. Sift  the flour, baking powder, and salt and add to the egg mixture.  Add  apricots, nuts and vanilla. Blend mixture and spread evenly over base.  Return to oven and bake about 30 - 35 minutes. Cool. Cut into squares and  dust with confectioners sugar. Makes 16 squares.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
