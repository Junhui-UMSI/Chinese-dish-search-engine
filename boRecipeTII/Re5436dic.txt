For a smoother texture, use an ice  cream maker and follow the manufacturers instructions for preparing  sherbet.    Per serving: Calories: 90 Fat: 2.6 g.

Cool to room temperature. Stir in the lime juice and  nutmeg.    Process the pineapple (with juice) in a blender until smooth. Add the  coconut mixture and blend well.    Transfer to a large, shallow plastic container with a tight-fitting lid.  Place in the freezer until the granita is frozen solid.    Think ahead: The granita keeps well in the freezer for a few days so you  can make it well ahead. Allow it to stand at room temperature for a few  minutes before scooping it out and serving it. Serves 8.    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Mar 19, 1998
