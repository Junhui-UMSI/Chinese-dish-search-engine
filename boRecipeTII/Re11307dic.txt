Ranch Chip Chicken W/ Honey Mustard Sauce
Honey, Mayo, HONEY MUSTARD SAUCE, Dijon mustard, Boneless Skinless Chicken, Ranch Chips, Mayo, 
Brush chicken with mayo, roll in crushed chips. Place on broiler pan and  bake in 425 oven for about 25 minutes. Serve with honey mustard sauce  below.    This is one of my favorite meals. Ive also made it with little pieces of  chicken for a party appetizer. I think my mom got this recipe at one of the  Southern Living magazines cooking schools. Anyway....
