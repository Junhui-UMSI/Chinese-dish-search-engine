Soak mushrooms in warm water 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving liquid. Strain  mushroom liquid.  Rinse mushrooms under cold running water. Squeeze to  remove as much moisture as possible. Heat oil in a large skillet. Add  mushrooms, parsley, garlic, anchovies and flour. Stir over medium heat  until garlic begins to color. Stir in wine. When wine is reduced by half,  add tuna steaks.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover and cook about 5  minutes.  Gently turn tuna and cook 3 to 5 minutes or until fish can be  flaked.  Place fish on a warm platter. Keep warm in oven. Add reserved  mushroom liquid to skillet with butter and lemon juice. Cook over high heat  until sauce has a medium-thick consistency. Spoon sauce over tuna. Serve  immediately.    You wont recognize this as the same fish you have had in cans.                                   per Fred Towner                                 Fidonet COOKING echo
