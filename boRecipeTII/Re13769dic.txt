Wild Rice with Mushrooms and Onions
Salt, Converted rice, Wild rice, Fresh ground black pepper, Mushrooms; sliced, Yellow onion; cut into, Butter or olive oil, 
SERVES 8-10      I have used this dish as a side dish, a main course, a stuffing for fowl,  and a filler for stuffed vegetables such as tomatoes or green peppers. Wild  rice takes longer to cook and requires more water because the grain  triples, while regular rice only doubles.      In a 3-quart heavy-lidded saucepan bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add  the salt and the wild rice. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.  Add the converted rice to the pot without stirring. Cover and continue  cooking another 15 minutes. Do not remove the lid. Let the rice sit for 5  minutes after finishing the cooking.      In the meantime, saute the onion in the butter or oil. When the onion  becomes clear, add the mushrooms and saute for 5 or 6 minutes.      When the rice is finished, stir in the mushrooms, onions, and black  pepper.      Correct the seasoning. Serve hot.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
