~----Primavera Sauce----- 2 teaspoons butter 2 teaspoons flour 1 cup nonfat  milk 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper    1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large pot, heat water to boil. Add  pasta and cook until just tender (about 8 minutes). Drain and rinse pasta  under cold water. Place in a large bowl and set aside.    2. Lightly grease a large baking dish. In a skillet heat sherry and olive  oil and saute green onion, garlic, and bell pepper until pepper is soft but  not mushy. Add cumin, oregano, basil, asparagus (cut diagonally into 2-inch  pieces), cherry tomatoes, and snow peas, and saute 2 minutes, stirring  frequently.    3. Remove from heat and toss with pasta and Primavera Sauce. Spoon into  baking dish. Bake until lightly browned and bubbling (about 25 minutes).    Primavera Sauce: In a saucepan heat butter and stir in flour. Cook 2  minutes, stirring, to eliminate floury taste, then slowly add milk,  stirring with a whisk. If milk is added slowly enough, the sauce should  thicken to a heavy cream consistency. Add cheese and pepper.
