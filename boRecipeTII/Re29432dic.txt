Heat oven to 350? (325? for glass baking dish). Line 13x9-inch baking pan  with foil extending over edges to form handles. Grease foil.    Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwavable bowl on HIGH 2 minutes  or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted.    Stir sugar into chocolate until well blended. Mix in eggs and vanilla. Stir  in flour until well blended. Spread in prepared pan.    Bake 30-35 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with  fudge crumbs. DO NOT OVERBAKE. Cool in pan. Run knife around edge of pan to  loosen brownies from sides. Lift from pan onto cutting board, using foil as  handles. Frost with White Chocolate Coconut Frosting.
