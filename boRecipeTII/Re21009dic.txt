Tvp Hash
Tomatoes, coarsely chopped, Water, Green pepper, coarsely, Parsley, Frozen corn kernels, Tvp, Rice, Onions, coarsely chopped., 3 teaspoons vegetable stock, 
Water saute the onions,pepper & garlic. Add the cumin and chilli and  continuing cooking. Combine the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 20  minutes. {Sometimes (since the amounts are approximate) the mixture comes  out soupy..in cases like this I add 1/4 cup bulger wheat and let simmer a  few more minutes...this usually absorbs the rest of the liquid}    *I dont usually measure such spices as theyre my favorite and I can never  add too much it seems.
