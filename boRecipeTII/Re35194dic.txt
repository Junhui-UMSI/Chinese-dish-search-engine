*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into thin  slices    **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl)    ***(combine all seasoning sauce ingredients in a cup)    Thoroughly mix beef with marinade and marinate for 30 minutes. Heat wok  over highest heat, when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp peanut oil. Add ginger and  salt and toss a few seconds. Add broccoli and stirfry one minute, then add  water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam until crisp tender. Uncover  and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated. Remove  broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and, when hot, add  remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until lightly browned but  not cooked through. Do not stirfry too vigorously or meat will not brown,  it is better to press slices against sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to  wok and toss. When hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until sauce  thickens (its a good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before you  hurl it into the wok). Turn onto a 02/24/92        4:15 PM platter and  drizzle sesame oil over the top. The sugar in the marinade and seasoning  sauce acts as a floor enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy  this recipe.
