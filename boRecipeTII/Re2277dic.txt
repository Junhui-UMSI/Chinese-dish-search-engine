Banana Cake
Banana pulp; mashed, Eggs, Sour cream, Baking soda, Pastry flour, Sugar, Butter, Vanilla, 
Here is a wonderful Banana Cake recipe that I got several years ago when my  class did a Jewish Genealogy project. It is a recipe that has been passed  down for years. It is delicious. I make it as a layer cake with cream  cheese frosting. I usually double the recipe and use 10 inch. round pans so  it is quite a large cake. It is normally baked in a oblong pan. Hope you  enjoy it.    Source: Gimel Class Cookbook    Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, beaten very lightly, and the baking soda,  dissolved in the sour cream. Beat well, then add bananas, pastry flour, 1/4  teaspoon salt and vanilla. Bake in a well buttered or sprayed with PAM  oblong pan, 7 1/4" x 11 1/4" x 1 1/2" in 350 degree oven. Bake for 35-45  minutes or until toothpic comes out clean. Enjoy!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Cynthia Heller  <hellerikecynthia@worldnet.att.net> on Aug 26, 1998, converted by MM_Buster  v2.0l.
