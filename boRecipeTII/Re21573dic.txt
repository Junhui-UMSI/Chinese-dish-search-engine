NOTES : Each time Laurie "innsat" for us she would leave the menus she had  prepared for breakfast and I kept seeing this "Apple Puff Pancake" on her  list.  Finally I asked her about this recipe and she shared it with me.  I  use it often and it is always well received.  In her other life, Laurie is  an outstanding seventh grade language arts teacher.
