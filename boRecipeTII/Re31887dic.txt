Tabbouleh (Lebanese Style)
Salt, fresh parsley, Fresh Lemon Juice, fresh mint, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, scallion, seeded seedless, Bulgur, Water, red onion, Ground allspice, 
Put bulgur in a heatproof bowl. Bring water to a boil and pour over bulgur.  Let bulgur stand 1 hour.    While bulgur is soaking, in a large bowl, stir together onion, salt,  allspice, and dried mint, if using (do not add fresh mint now), and let  stand 30 minutes. Drain bulgur in a sieve, pressing hard to extract as much  water as possible, and add to onion mixture with remaining ingredients,  including fresh mint, if using.    Toss salad well and season with salt and pepper.    Appeared in the Jan 1995 issue of Gourmet magazine.
