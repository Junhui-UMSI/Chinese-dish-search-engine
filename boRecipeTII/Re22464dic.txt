Stir in the peas, basil, salt,, nutmeg, and white pepper. Add the  scallops and any juice around them and cook until mixture starts to bubble,  about 1 minute.    Stir in the chicken broth and wine and stir until liquid thickens, about 2  minutes. Reduce heat and simmer gently about 4 to 5 minutes, or until the  scallops are opaque. Stir in the parsley just before serving. To serve,  spoon 1/2 cup of cooked orzo on each plate and top with 1/2 cup of the  scallop mixture. Makes 6 (1-cup) servings.
