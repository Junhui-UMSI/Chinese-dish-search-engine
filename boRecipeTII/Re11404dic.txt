Ras Malai (Indian Sweet Dessert)
Vanilla, Rose Water, Ricotta Cheese, Bay leaf, Half and half, Cardamon pods, Sugar, 
1. Mix 1.5 cups of sugar with the Ricotta cheese and bake it in a 400o F  oven for about 1hr and 15 minutes in a flat dish covered with aluminum  foil. The cheese should have hard- ened and turned a pale brown.    2. Thicken the Half and Half by simmering over low heat for a long time.  This is best done in a microwave; if a microwave is not available, do it  over low heat and stir frequently. Thicken until the volume drops to around  half of the origi- nal volume.    3. Add the remaining 0.5 cup sugar, cardamon pods, bay leaf, vanilla and  rose water (and any other flavouring that you may want) to the Half and  Half. Heat for a few minutes.    4. After the cheese has been baked, cut it into 1 inch squares and add to  the hot thickened half and half. Cool for a few hours in the fridge.
