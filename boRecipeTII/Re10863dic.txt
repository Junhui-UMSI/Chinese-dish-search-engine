Quinoa Tabouli
Freshly squeezed lemon juice, Salt, Parsley, Scallions, Water, Quinoa, Ripe tomatoes, Safflower oil, Fresh mint, 
Note:  The author says that 1 tsp. dried mint could be used, but dried mint  is nasty stuff, IMHO!    Pour water into a 1-quart saucepan.  Add quinoa; bring to a boil. Reduce  heat to a simmer; cover.  Cook for 10 to 15 min., or until all water has  been absorbed.    While the quinoa is cooking, finely chop the tomatoes, parsley, and  scallions.  Add lemon juice, oil, and mint to tomato mixture. Stir in  cooked quinoa and salt. Mix well.    Let tabouli sit in the refrigerator for a day to blend flavors.    Note:  Also, she neglected to mention that tabouli is traditionally served  at room temperature.    The recipe was from Linda Najjar of Seattle, Washington, and the "Herb  Companion" note on it said: "Substituting quinoa for the traditional bulgur  wheat gives this tabouli a lighter, fluffier, and slightly nutty taste and  enables people allergic to wheat to experience the flavorful joys of this  Middle Eastern dish."
