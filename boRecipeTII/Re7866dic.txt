Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in milk, 3/4 cup sugar,  salt, 3 eggs, margarine and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough  remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly  floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in  greased bowl. Turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in warm place until  double, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. (Dough is ready if indentation remains when  touched.) Punch down dough and divide into halves. Shape each half into  round, slightly flat loaf. Place each loaf in greased round 9x1 1/2-inch  layer cake pan. Cover and let rise until double, about 1 hour. Heat oven to  350F. Beat 1 egg slightly and brush over loaves. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon  sugar. Bake until loaves are golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.    SNAIL LOAVES (CARACOIS): After dividing dough into halves, roll each half  into a rope about 25x1 1/2-inches. Coil each to form a snail shape in  greased round 9-inch layer cake pan.
