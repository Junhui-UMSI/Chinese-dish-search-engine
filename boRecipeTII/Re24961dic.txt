ROLL about a third of each color dough into I0-inch ropes on a lightly  floured surface. Twist ropes together; fold in crosswise and flatten  slightly. Roll 1/8 inch thick (keep remaining dough refrigerated). Cut with  leaf-shape cookie cutters . Place cutouts 1 inch apart on greased cookie  sheets. Score veins with a table knife or skewer.
