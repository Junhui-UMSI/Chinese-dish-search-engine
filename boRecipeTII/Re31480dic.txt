From: bfrumker@cmnh.org (Bruce Frumker)    Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 12:17:49 -0400  Walter Jetton was BBQ caterer to the LBJ Ranch.  In 1965, he (along with  Arthur Whitman) published "Walter Jettons LBJ Barbecue Cook Book."  I have  mentioned it a couple of times in posts, and, since the book is long out of  print, I got several requests to post some of the recipes.  Here are some  of my favorites, along with Jettons comments and instructions...    This is the secret of the ages I am giving you here, and I would not be  surprised if wars have been fought over less.  Use this as a plate or table  sauce with beef, chicken, pork or almost anything else.  Dont cook things  in it.    (about 2 1/2 cups) Combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil.  Simmer  about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and strain.    (note - the celery pieces that you strain out from the sauce are among the  most delicious things I have ever tasted - really wonderful.  In fact, I  sometimes made the sauce just to have some of the yummy celery. - Bruce)    bbq-digest V2 #058    From the BBQ recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
