Cover pan well with butter  as it melts. Beat eggs with remaining ingredients. Pour into pan and tilt  to spread eggs to edges. Cook over low heat. Loosen eggs from sides of pan  with spatula as they begin to set. Lift eggs with spatula and tilt pan to  allow uncooked eggs to run to sides and under eggs to continue cooking.  Carefully lift one side of outer edge of eggs with spatula and fold over  towards center making a half circle or flattened cone. Slide omelet out of  pan onto dish and serve. If filling omelet, spoon filling mixture on top of  and in the center of omelet prior to folding edges over to form half  circle.
