Request for Christmas Punch from Tammy Blandis: I have made this punch  several times for parties, and people always ask for the recipe.  I  originally got it from the July, 91 issue of Southern Living magazine.     Combine the first 5 ingredients; add the ginger ale, and stir gently.  Makes 1 gallon, serves about 12.     NOTE: I like to float a frozen ring of prepared lemonade with whole  strawberries in the punch bowl.    HALL@HPN.TRW.COM (LAURA HALL)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
