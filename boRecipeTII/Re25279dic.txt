Top Secret Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chip Cookies
Softened butter, Sugar, Brown sugar, Eggs, Vanilla, All purpose flour, Salt, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Semisweet chocolate chips, 
Preheat the oven to 350~.  In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter,  sugars, eggs, and vanilla.  Sift together the flours, salt, baking powder,  and baking soda.  Combine the wet and dry ingredients.  Stir in chocolate  chips.  With your fingers, place golf-ball-size dough portions 2" apart on  an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 9 minutes, or until edges are light  brown. Note: Do not exceed baking time even if they look underbaked.    Finished product should be soft in the middle and crunchy around the edges.  Variations:  Substitute milk chocolate for the semisweet and/or add 1-1/2  cups of chopped walnuts or macadamia nuts to the recipe before baking. For  the best cookie, don't substitute margarine for the butter.   SOURCE: Todd  Wilburs Top Secret Recipes
