Sweet Potato Soup
Soy milk, Salt to taste, Margarine, Celery, pepper, Onions, Bay Leaves, Dried thyme, celery leaves, sweet potatoes, Carrots, Ground nutmeg, 
Heat the margarine in a large pot. Add the onions, carrots and celery  and saute over low heat until the onions are golden. Add the celery  leaves and sweet potato dice. Just add enough water to cover all but  about one inch of the vegetables.    Bring to a boil, then stir in the bay leaves and seasonings. Simmer  over moderate heat until the sweet potatoes and vegetables are  tender, about 20 minutes.    With a slotted spoon, remove about half of the solid ingredients and  transfer to a food processor along with about one-half of the cooking  liquid.    Process until smoothly pureed, then stir back into the soup pot.    Add the soy milk as needed to achieve a slightly thick consistency.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer over very low heat for  another 10 to 15 minutes.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
