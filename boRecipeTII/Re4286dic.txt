In  truth though our family collects rhubarb recipes, so here they are.    In saucepan, heat whipping cream over medium heat till bubbles begin to  appear around edge of the pan. Slowly pour in sugar; cook and stir for 2 to  3 minutes or till sugar is dissolved. Immediately place pan in a pan of ice  water. Cool to room temperature. Stir in vanilla. Transfer mixture to a  large bowl. Cover and chill for 4 to 24 hours.    Stir Rosy Rhubarb Sauce into cream mixture. Transfer mixture to a 1 gallon  ice cream freezer. Freeze according to manufacturers directions. Makes 3  quarts ice cream.    Rosy Rhubarb Sauce: In a saucepan, mix sugar, water and orange peel. Bring  to boiling. Add rhubarb slices. Reduce heat. Simmer uncovered, for about 8  minutes or till rhubarb is tender and mixture is thickened, stirring as  necessary to prevent sticking. Cool; chill. Makes 3 1/2 cups.
