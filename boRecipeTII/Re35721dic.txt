Cabbage heads, Pine nuts, Clarified Butter, Eggs, Salt & freshly ground pepper, Chopped fresh dill, Lemon, juice only, Butter; cut into bits, Raisins or currants, Chopped fresh parsley, Raw long grain rice, Onion; chopped fine, Water, 
Plunge cabbages into boiling salted water and cook about 8 minutes, then  drain thoroughly and set aside while you prepare the filling. In a heavy  skillet heat the clarified butter, add the chopped onions and cook until  soft and transparent.  Add the water and bring to a boil, then add the rice  and stir.  Lower the heat and simmer gently until the rice has absorbed the  liquid, approximately 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and add the raisins or  currants, pine nuts, parsley, dill and season with salt and pepper. Cool.  Separate 2 of the eggs and mix the egg whites into filling. Reserve the  yolks for the avgolemono.  Stuff and roll the cabbage leaves, using one  heaping tablespoon filling, roll up snugly, then place, seam side down, in  a casserole.  Dot with butter and add water to cover, then cover cabbage  rolls with an inverted plate and cover casserole. Simmer for approximately  1 hour, then transfer to a warm serving dish and keep warm. Strain the  remaining liquid for the avgolemono sauce. Beat the remaining eggs and  yolks for 2 minutes. Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon juice.  Then add the 1-1/2 cups cooking liquid by droplets, beating steadily, until  all has been added. Cook over hot water, not boiling, stirring constantly  until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. Pour over the cabbage  rolls and serve hot.
