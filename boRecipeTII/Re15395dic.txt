Heres a recipe from the Southern Season in Chapel Hill, NC, provided by  chef Devon Mills.    Grate cheese first and let stand until room temperature; it will combine  better.  Blend all ingredients until smooth.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours  before serving. Makes 1 1/2 cups of spread.    Please note, Devon allows for additional heat beyond the jalapenos, and has  no particular sauce or amount thereof, to use. Thats your option.  Adios.    douglas allen thompson <aesculus@TSO.Cin.IX.net>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
