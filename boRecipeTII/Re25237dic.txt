Tony Romas Bbq Sauce
Dark corn syrup, Onion powder, Tobassco, Sugar, Garlic powder, Salt, Ketchup, 
Having never had Tony Romas food, I cant tell you if this recipe is  authentic or not. I copied it a couple of years back from one of those "Top  Secret Recipes" books. There were recipes in there for the Carolina Honeys,  the standard baby back ribs, and the hot and spicy ribs.    Combine all and heat to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook 30 - 45 minutes.    The Carolina Honey recipe was virtually identical, except there was honey  added (in addition to the corn syrup if I remember correctly). The cooking  method, etc. was identical.
