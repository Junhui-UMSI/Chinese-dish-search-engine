Yogurt Scones
Cold Butter, Egg Beaters? 99% Egg, Brown sugar, Whole-wheat flour, Baking Powder, Salt, Nonfat Yogurt; *Note, Packed Raisins; Or Sultanas,, White Flour; Unbleached, Baking soda, 
These scones are unusually light and fluffy.    Unlike most recipes for scone, this one doesnt require any rolling or  cutting of the dough. In fact, the "dough" is more of a batter, and can be  droped - like cookies - directly onto the baking shee. Because of this  great shortcut, the recipe can be completely assembled in just 15 minutes.  So pull this one out if you have guests coming for tea on short notice.    *NOTE: Original recipe used firm yogurt **NOTE: Original recipe used 2  regular eggs    Preheat oven to 400 deg F. Lightly grease a baking sheet with nonstick  spray or an alternative.    Sift together the first 5 ingredients. Then cut together with butter and  brown sugar, using a food processor (steel blade attachment), pastry cutter  or electric mixer - until uniformly blended. It should resemble coarse  meal. If using a feel processor, transfer everything to a bowl.    Beat the yogurt together with 1 egg. Make a well in the center of the dry  ingredients, and add the yogurt mixture along with the dried fruit. Mix as  minimally as possible, with swift, decisive strokes, until well blended.  Drop by rounded quarter-cup measures onto the lightly greased sheet. Beat  the remaining egg. Brush the tops with beaten egg (the softenss of the  batter might require you to pat, rather than brush, it on).    Bake 12 - 15 minutes. Serve hot or warm.
