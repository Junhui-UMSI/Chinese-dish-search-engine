Add melted  butter and press into the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Bake for 5  minutes at 350 F. Allow to cool.    Cream cream cheese and add sugar.  Mix well. blend in vanilla, flour,  cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each  addition. Stir in lemon peel and juice. Pour mixture onto cooled crust.  Swirl in 3/4 cups of the raspberry puree. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes  (internal temperature should register 170 F). Turn off oven and allow  cheesecake to cool down with oven. Remove from oven and alow to cool  completely.  Loosen sides of cheesecake from the pan. Refrigerate.    When ready to serve, put a few spoons-full of the raspberry puree on a  plate, top with a slice of cheescake.  Top cheescake with raspberries and  grated lemon peel.    This went over really well as one of the many desserts we made for  Christmas dinner. In fact a number of the pies remained untouched, while  the cheescake was gone by the end of the day.
