*NOTE:  Original recipe used 2 T oil... I reduced it and it was fine.    Cut the rind off the orange in one long strip.  Scrape off all of the  excess pith from the back and set aside. Squeeze the juice from the orange  and reserve.    Place the olive oil in a large, heavy pot over low heat.   Add the onions  and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about 15 min.  Sprinkle with salt, pepper and marjoram.    Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, broth, reserved orange peel  and juice, and the lentils. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to  medium and simmer, partially covered, for 30 minutes, stirring  occasionally.    Remove the orange peel and discard.  Adjust seasonings and stir in the  parsley.  Serve steaming hot with warm crusty bread.    Serves 6    This was really wonderful!!
