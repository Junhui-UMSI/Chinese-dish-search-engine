Place the first set of ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce  the heat and simmer over medium heat, uncovered, for 20 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Drain and place in a bowl. Whisk together the second set of  ingredients until well blended. Pour over the tofu and toss gently. Cover  and chill several hours, stirring occasionally to ensure the tofu cubes are  evenly coated by the marinade. Store in the fridge (it keeps for a week or  more), and drain before using.
