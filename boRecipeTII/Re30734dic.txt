Place chicken in a casserole. Mix  lemon juice and salt and rub over chicken, pressing the mixture into the  slits. Allow to sit for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the yogurt,  garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, paprika, cayenne and turmeric. Spread  evenly over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove the  chicken from the marinade and place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  (Chicken may be trussed with string if a prettier shape is important).  Brush chicken with one or two tablespoons of melted butter. Place in a  400F. oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350F. and continue cooking,  basting occasionally with pan juices, for 1 to 1-1/4 hrs or until chicken  tests done. (To test for doneness, pierce the thigh with the point of a  small knife. The juice should run a pale yellow with no sign of pink.) If  meat is still pink, continue cooking for an extra 5 to 10 minutes. SERVES  4.
