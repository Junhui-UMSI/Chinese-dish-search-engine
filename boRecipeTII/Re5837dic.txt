(Translation by yours truly)    Cut open red and green peppers.  Remove seeds and white part.  Cut them in  slices 3 mm wide.  Heat a large pan.  When hot, add the oil and peppers.  Add some salt. When golden, lower heat and cover the pan. Add chili flakes,  chopped tomatoes, salt and sugar and tomato sauce.  Cover and cook over  medium-high heat. Stir regularly. After 5 minutes remove lid and cook until  the mixture is soft and wel amalgamated.    Whisk eggs, add water, salt and pepper.  The mixture must be light and  fluffy.  Heat a medium size pan.  Add oil and pour the eggs.  Shake the pan  and lift the omelette to allow the uncooked part of the omelette to run  underneath.  The omelette should not be overcooked and dry.  When ready,  lift one side of the omelette and place one tsp of butter underneath, makin  sure it melts and covers the bottom of the omelette.    Place the omelette in a large plate and pour the filling over it.  Fold and  serve immediately. Serves 4.    (Note: the typical piperade is served with Prosciutto ham slices)    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #119    From the MealMaster recipe list.
