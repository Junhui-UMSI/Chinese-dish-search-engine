Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large saucepan, heat oil and saute onions  until lightly browned.  Add the TVP mince, stir and cook for two minutes.  Pour the hot water or stock over the saute and simmer for four minutes.    In a separate bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, herbs and garlic together with one  cup cold water.  Stir in the egg and leave to one side for ten minutes.    Combine the cooked TVP mince with the breadcrumbs mixture, then add the soy  sauce.  Stir well and season to taste. Using your hands, shape the mixture  into an oval mound and place it in the center of a large baking dish,  leaving plenty of space all around for the tomato sauce to run.    Heat the tomatoes, tomato paste and seasoning in a small saucepan, and pour  over the loaf, then bake for one hour. Serves 6.    JTKs notes:  I usually add more herbs & chopped garlic, and saute chopped  vegetables like celery, carrots, and/or mushrooms after onions are done but  before adding TVP.  Hot sauce is a good addition, too, or other flavored  sauce like veg.  Worcestershire. The egg replacer works fine --- i have no  idea what its like with a real egg. Also, I make the tomato sauce  differently (sometimes I use canned/jar or homemade frozen sauce, usually  dont bother heating it up first, and I prefer canned whole tomatoes,  pureed, to prechopped ones), but it doesnt matter much. I make breadcrumbs  from whatever bread is available, preferably wholewheat (lightly toasted  for dryness) ~-- doesnt matter much either. Cracker crumbs or matzo meal  would probably do as well, if you dont have bread around or a food  processor/blender.  Ive made 1.5x recipe into a single loaf OK, but larger  wouldnt work (would have to make separate loaves, if larger quantities are  desired)    Judy Karpen
