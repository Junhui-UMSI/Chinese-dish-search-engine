Baked Caramel Corn
Salt, Baking soda, Brown sugar, Corn syrup, Nuts; almonds; pecans -OR-, Vanilla, Butter, Popped popcorn, 
Pop popcorn and remove old maids. Spread popcorn in a large flat pan and  preheat in a 250~ oven. In a saucepan, melt butter and stir in brown sugar,  corn syrup, and salt. Stir constantly until the mixture comes to a boil,  and continue to boil without stirring for about 5 minutes (240~). Remove  from heat and add soda and vanilla, stirring until foamy. If nuts are used,  add them now, stirring until heated through and no longer clumped. Pour  syrup mixture over preheated popcorn and stir to coat. Bake for about 30  minutes, stirring 2 or 3 times to evenly distribute the coating. Bake  longer, about 60 minutes, for a more Crackerjacks-like taste. Cool, break  up and store airtight.
