Wolfgang Puck is a German-born chef who has made his mark here in  California.  He has such goldmines as Spagos in LA and Stars in the  City plus a few more salted away around the globe.  This is Wolfgang  Pucks very own punkin pie.  How does it stack up against Grandmas?    Line a buttered 10-inch pie dish or flan ring with pastry.    Refrigerate for 1/2 hour.  Line with parchment paper and fill with pie  weights or uncooked beans.  Bake at 350F for 25 minutes, or until  crust is golden.  Let cool.  Remove paper and beans.    Meanwhile, in large stainless steel saucepan, combine sugar syrup,  orange peel, Grand Marnier, vanilla bean with scrapings, cinnamon  stick and nutmeg.  Bring to boil.  Stir in cranberries then reduce  heat and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes or until berries are softened.  Remove vanilla bean and cinnamon stick.  Spread mixture in thin layer  on bottom of tart shell. (Leftover marmalade is good served on side  with smoked meat, fowl or curry.)    In a bowl, combine pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,  cloves and pepper.  Beat in eggs, cream, half and half and bourbon,  Pour into pastry shell.  Bake at 375F for 30 to 40 minutes or until  set.    Serve warm with cinnamon ice cream, if desired.
