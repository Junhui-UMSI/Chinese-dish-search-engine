Weve added a new Kitchen Staff member today, and in honor of her addition  to the team, we offer you the Apple-Rice Betty. Once again, its your  choice of apple to feature in your prep- aration; we prefer a tart Winesap  in our Betty, but a good McIntosh is just as tangy and tasty.    Rumor has it that this recipe was named after the Mother of All Recipe  Collectors -- Betty Crocker. Unfortunately, we can not prove beyond a  shadow of a doubt whether todays recipe is fact or fiction. Around The  Kitchen, culinary myth simply doesnt matter -- we just recommend you enjoy  your Betty as a salad or a dessert tonight! Right now, our Betty is  enjoying Kitchen clean-up duties!    Combine the cooked rice, apple juice, salt, brown sugar, raisins, and diced  apples in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium and cover to simmer for about 10 minutes, or  until most of the liquid is absorbed by the rice.    Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the butter. Stir until the butter  is melted. Refrigerate to chill the mixture for about 30 minutes to an  hour. Meanwhile, whip the heavy cream and chill until youre ready to  serve.    Just before serving, fold most of the whipped cream into the rice mixture  and gently blend with a spatula. Serve cold, topped with a dollop of the  remaining whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg, if so desired.  Refrigerate to store remaining servings for up to 3 days.
