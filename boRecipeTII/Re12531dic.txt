Serves: 6 Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours    Gently fry onion in oil until soft.  Mix into meat with rice, tomato, herbs  and cinnamon, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Divide into 24  portions.    Blanch cabbage leaves in boiling, salted water for 5 minutes until  softened. Drain and cut out thick centre of larger leaves (very large  leaves may be cut in half). Place one portion of stuffing on base of leaf,  turn up base, fold in sides and wrap firmly into a neat roll. Repeat with  remaining ingredients.    Place rolls close together, seam sides down, in a deep pan lined with  trimmings from cabbage leaves.  Add stock or water, butter, salt and pepper  to taste. Invert a heavy plate on top of rolls and cover pan tightly.  Simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours.    When cooked, drain off stock carefully into a small saucepan. Reduce to 1 1  1/2 cups over heat and thicken with cornflour mixed to a paste with a  little cold water. Let it boil 1 minute.    Beat egg whites in a bowl until stiff, add yolks and beat thoroughly.  Gradually beat in lemon juice, then boiling stock. Return sauce to small  pan, place over low heat and stir constantly until egg is cooked - do not  boil.    Arrange rolls on a heated serving dish and spoon some of the sauce over  them.  Garnish with chopped dill or parsley and serve remaining sauce  separately.   Serve with mashed potatoes.    Note:  Grape vine leaves may be used instead of cabbage - about 40 will be  required since they take less filling.    From: "The Complete Middle East Cookbook" by Tess Mallos.
