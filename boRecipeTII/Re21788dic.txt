1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and  date sugar. Make a well in center of dry ingredients and grate in butter  and stir in oil. With fingers or a pastry mixer, combine butter and flour  mixture until it is the texture of cornmeal. Do not overmix or butter will  melt. Add egg white, vinegar, and enough of the ice water to form 8 small  balls of dough. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 minutes.    2. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine cranberries, apples, apple  juice, currants, and maple syrup. Cook, uncovered, until berries pop. In a  small bowl combine arrowroot with lemon juice and add to cranberries along  with cinnamon and lemon rind.  Cook, stirring frequently, until mixture  thickens. Remove from heat and let cool 10 minutes.    3. Lightly flour a counter or breadboard. Roll each ball of dough into a  6-inch circle and press into a 4-inch tart pan (preferably one with fluted  edges). Fill two thirds full with cranberry filling and sprinkle with  ground almonds. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool before serving.    Makes 8 tarts.    Note: Crunchy date sugar adds a fruity taste to the whole wheat pastry  dough, but if it is not available, substitute an equal amount of maple  sugar or honey.
