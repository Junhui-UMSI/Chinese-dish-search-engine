This recipe for Mexican tamales is a long, involved process!  It takes,  quite literally, 2 days to prepare.  This is my mothers recipe, handed  down from who-knows-how-many generations. My mothers tamales are the very  best, and Im not just saying that! ;) Follow this recipe -exactly- as  written, no shortcuts!    Because the recipe is so very long and involved, Ill write the directions  in order of steps.  If you were very dedicated, you *could* do the tamales  all in one day, but I highly recommend you take 2 days to do it.    DAY ONE:    1. Trim fat off the roasts    2. Rinse meat clean in sink    3. Submerge meat in water in boiling pot, and cook over medium heat for  about 4 hours or until tender. (Each roast should need its own pot. Cook  them all at the same time. Do not salt the water.)    4. Scoop off dried blood as it cooks.    5. When meat has completely cooled, remove bone and fat [save the cooked  fat in its own bowl] and shred remaining meat. Place shredded meat in bowl.    6. IMPORTANT: Save _all_ of the broth!    7. Refrigerate everything for DAY TWO.
