Wild Mushroom Sauce
Finely chopped garlic, (14-1/2 oz) low-salt chicken, All purpose flour, Plus 1 tablespoon chopped, Finely chopped fresh, Dry sherry, Butter, Browning and seasoning sauce, Ground cumin, Oyster mushrooms; halved, Finely chopped fresh oregano, Plus 1 teaspoon finely, 
The recipes for the potatoes and mushroom sauce are adapted from the Feb 97  edition of Bon Appetit. Here they are:    Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add  mushrooms, 1/2 cup shallots, garlic and 1 tablespoon jalapeno; saute until  mushrooms are very tender and beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove  from heat. Add chopped cilantro, oregano and 1 teaspoon cumin. Season with  salt and pepper.    Put broth in heavy medium saucepan. Gradually whisk flour into Sherry in  medium bowl to blend. Whisk Sherry mixture, 1 tablespoon butter, 1  tablespoon shallots and one teaspoon jalapeno into broth; bring to boil,  whisking until smooth. Add browning sauce. Stir in mushroom mixture. Boil  until mixture thickens to sauce consistency, stirring occasionally, about 5  minutes. Season with salt and pepper.    Note: this sauce recipe was originally meant to accompany a Cumin Pork  Roast (which also sounds excellent!) and called for pan drippings from the  pork. I substituted the browning and seasoning sauce since I didnt have  the pan drippings available. The sauce was great over the mashed potatoes  and smoked turkey!
