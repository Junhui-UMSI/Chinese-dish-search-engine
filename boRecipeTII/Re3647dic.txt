Pei Quot (Roasted Spare Ribs)
Vegetable oil, Rice Wine, spare ribs, Scallion, ginger root, Black beans, Garlic, Honey, Chicken broth, Soy sauce, Hoisin sauce, 
PREPARATION:    Remove as much fat and gristle as you can from the meat and cut apart into  individual ribs.  Wash black beans and mash. Mince ginger root and the  scallion. Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Mix black beans, ginger root,  garlic.  Mix soy sauce, honey, hoisin sauce, and rice wine.    COOKING:    Heat oil in a large deep skillet or wok, and add ginger root and the  scallion.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the ribs and stir-fry for 5 minutes.  Add soy sauce mixture; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth. Stir  ribs to coat them with the sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low.  Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring the ribs every 5 or 6 minutes to  coat them with the sauce.  Remove the ribs from the skillet and spread in a  large shallow roasting pan, in one layer if possible. Roast in a 350-degree  oven for 10 minutes. If ribs are not dry in 10 minutes, roast a little  longer.  They may also be barbecued on an outdoor grill instead of roasted  in the oven.    NOTE: This sauce is quite spicy.  If you prefer a milder dish, omit the  hoisin sauce.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
