Beaumont Inns Corn Pudding
(level) flour, Eggs, White whole kernel corn; or, milk, (rounded) sugar, Butter, Salt, 
Decided to stop lurking for a while and pull my weight with some recipes!  This was taken from "Beaumont Inn, Special Recipes".    Combine corn, flour, salt, sugar, butter. In a separate bowl beat eggs then  add milk. Add corn mixture and pour into baking dish. Bake in 450 degree  oven for 40 minutes. Stir while baking at 10 minute increments, leaving top  as intact as possible. Roxanna    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 645 by Willam Pender  <kpender@ficom.net> on Jan 30, 1998
