Thaw tofu quickly by placing bag in boiling water. Rinse with cool water.  (This is because tofu that has been frozen and thawed, can be easily  crumbled.) Take tofu from bag and squeeze to remove excess water. Shred  tofu into small pieces with fork. In a bowl combine tofu, soy sauce, and  A-1 sauce. Meanwhile, medium heat a large skillet or a heavy cook-pot. Add  oil saute garlic and onion; add chili powder, add cumin. Add tofu mixture  to seasoned onions in the pot, and mix well. Add chopped tomatoes with  juice, tomato sauce, and two cans of beans. Cook 15-20 minutes.    From: The Best Little Tofu Cookbook from Marjon by Marcia Miller
