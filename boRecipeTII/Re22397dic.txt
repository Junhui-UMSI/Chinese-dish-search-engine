Peel and dice turnips.  Melt the butter (or use olive oil) in a large  skillet; add turnips, cover and cook over medium heat for about 10-12  minutes, or until they begin to color--changing from white to a light  yellow.  Set them aside. Bring the consomme to a simmer in a medium  saucepan.  Add the turnips and a pinch of sugar. Simmer, skimming if  necessary, until the turnips are cooked and soft when piered with a fork,  about 10 to 15 minutes. If the peas are frozen, pour boiling hot water over  them and let stand for 3 minutes. Drain. If the peas are fresh, blanch in  boiling water until bright green, about 1 minute. Drain. Place the peas and  croutons in a warmed soup tureen and cover with the hot turnip soup. Serve  immediately in heated individual soup bowls.
