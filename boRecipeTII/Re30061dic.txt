In a non-stick fry pan, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add chicken; cover  and cook, turning, for about 10 minutes until the pieces are brown on all  sides.  Remove the chicken from the pan; set aside.    To the drippings in the pan, add onion, peppers, and garlic; cook stirring  about 5 minutes or until slightly tender.    Add tomatoes, vinegar and red pepper flakes.  Heat mixture to boiling;  reduce heat and simmer until mixture is slightly thick (about five  minutes).    Stir in the olives, salt and pepper.  Return chicken to the pan; spoon  sauce over chicken and cook about 20 minutes or until the chicken is glazed  and fork tender.    Arrange the chicken on a serving platter.  Spoon the vegetable mixture over  the chicken.  Sprinkle with pine nuts.  Garnish with Basil sprigs.    Cook:   Gilda S.
