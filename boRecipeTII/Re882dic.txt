Honey-Ginger Glazed Carrots
Sesame oil, Honey, ginger, Garlic, Soy sauce, Carrots, 
Quarter carrots lengthwise and cut into 3- to 4-inch lengths. Prepare a  medium-hot fire in the grill with a lightly-oiled vegetable rack in place.    Combine the sesame oil, honey, ginger, garlic and soy sauce and mix well.  Pour over the carrots and toss to coat.    Grill the carrots, tossing frequently, until tender and grill-marked,  about 10 minutes.    Place on a serving platter, drizzle any remaining glaze over the carrots,  and serve hot.
