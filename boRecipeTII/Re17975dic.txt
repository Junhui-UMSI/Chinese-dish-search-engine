You just toss stuff in  and blend.  You can make it without one, but it is more work.  A spring  form pan will give you a pretty cake. But it tastes just as good baked in a  regular cake pan and served a little on the mangled side.    crust: Toss it all in a food processor and blend.  Crumbs should stick  together.  If they dont, add a little more melted butter.  Pack into  bottom and up the sides of a springform pan    filling: Once again, toss it all in a food processor and blend until  smooth. Pour into the prepared crust. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees ... or  until filling is firm and top is golden brown. When cake is cooled you can  add topping.    Topping: Like before ... toss it all in a food processor, and go at it.  Pour on cake.  Chill for about an hour so it sets up nice.  Put the cake on  your serving plate and remove the springform pan.    If you want to be really decadent, pour a can of prepared cherry pie  filling over the whole thing just before serving.    Serve with bedraggled but proud look, and tell all your friends the effort  involved is worth it for the look on their faces. ;-)    CAUTION:  Once people try this, they MAY keep asking you to make them one.
