Peant Butter Pie
Sticks margarine or butter;, Peanut butter, Nondairy whipped topping;, Prepared graham cracker pie, Brown Sugar, 
Beat margarine, sugar, and peanut butter in a large bowl with electric  mixer on high speed until well blended. Beat in whipped topping until  mixture is smooth and creamy. Spoon into crust. Refrigerate 4 hours or  until firm. Garnish with additional whipped topping and peanuts, if  desired.    This pie tends to be rich, but oh so delish! I hope you enjoy!
