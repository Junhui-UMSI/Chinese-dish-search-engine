One of our favorite quick (but incredibly messy) meals is "fried" brown  rice.  I find I like it even better than the fried white rice I get at  Chinese restaurants.  We had this last night:    In a LARGE non-stick skillet, saute the ginger, garlic, onion, mushrooms  and any other veggies that need pre-cooking for about 5 minutes. Transfer  to a bowl.  Dry off the bottom of the skillet, return to heat (oops, I  forgot the heat setting -- medium high does really well) and add rice. Dry  fry it for a while, until some of it turns golden brown. Then add back the  cooked veggies, the green onions and peas. Sprinkle with soy sauce to taste  and mix all well. Heat thoroughly. Enjoy! Then spend the rest of the week  getting rice granules out of your stove.
