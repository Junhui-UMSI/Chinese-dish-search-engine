Mix it all together and marinate your yardbirds in it overnight.   The next day, smoke as you normally would (I like using oak and mesquite) and use the marinade as a mop.   Experiment with this as my ingredients change with my mood, but it always draws raves.  I have an annual 4th of July party at my house and do 24 chickens like this (and 8 whole briskets) and have been told these are the best my guests have ever tasted.  (Yeah, Im braggin, but thats my right!).
