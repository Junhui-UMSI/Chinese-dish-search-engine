Any blend of fruit is welcome at brunch, but the lichees and apricots make  this one special. Serve with yogurt or creme fraiche, and extra candied  ginger, if desired.    Drain lichees, reserving juice in small nonaluminum saucepan; cover and  refrigerate lichees. Add apricots and raisins to saucepan; cover and soak  for 1 hour or refrigerate overnight. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer  for about 10 minutes or until apricots are tender. Let cool.    Peel grapefruit; with sharp knife, pare off outer membrane. Holding fruit  over large bowl, cut away sections from inner membranes; squeeze out juice  from membranes.    Halve, peel and seed honeydew; cut into bite-size cubes. Add melon,  pineapple, ginger, lichees and apricot mixture to bowl. Toss and add honey  to taste. Chill for up to 4 hours.    Makes about 8 servings.
