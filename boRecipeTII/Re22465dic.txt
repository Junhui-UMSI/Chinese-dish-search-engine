This soup uses canned and frozen products I usually have on hand. It is  delicious, IMHO .. very easy and quick, and I always feel so righteous  making soups with tomato, beans, spinach and pasta. There are so many  similar recipes .. I got this one from 365 One Dish Meals.    1. Saute onion, garlic, celery and carrots until onion is softened, about  5-6 minutes.    2. Mix in broth, tomatoes with liquid, macaroni, parsley, basil, beans,  spinach, salt and pepper. Heat to boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer  15-20 minutes or until macaroni is tender (I added frozen spinach the last       10    minutes).    3. Serve hot, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, if desired (and I added red  pepper flakes).  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n057 by music_class@earthlink.net (Katja) on  Feb 28, 1997.
