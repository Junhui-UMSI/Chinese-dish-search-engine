This chili recipe is a little more time consuming than the Claiborne I  posted for you, but it is great. It was in an article in the 10/19/86 issue  of the LA Times Magazine prior to the 20th Annual World Championship Chili  Cookoff. It was written by Betsy Balsley. She wrote-- "In preparation [for  the cookoff], you might try your hand at creating a bit of true Americana  for dinner. You can > dress our California-style chili with chopped onions  and cheese, but do honor the basic rules of real chili-making and skip the  beans. Genuine chiliheads never add them."  I guess Mr. Claiborne would beg  to differ with Ms. Balsley.  :) :)  So for purists  Saute meat with half of garlic in 5 tablespoons oil  until browned. Saute onions separately with remaining garlic in remaining 5  tablespoons oil until tender but not browned. Add onions to meat; then add  chili powder, cumin, oregano, brown sugar, salt and pepper. Simmer 10  minutes. Add green chiles, beef broth, tomato sauce, cayenne to taste and  beer. Cover and simmer over low heat 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours until meat is  very tender. Chili will be soupy at first, then will thicken as it cooks.  Uncover last half hour. Stir >> frequently and do not allow chili to stick  to pot or become too thick.  Add more beer or water if needed. Skim off any  excess fat. Makes 1 gallon, or 12 to 16 servings.

Dont know if it  will be enough to feed your crowd-- you might have to double up!
