Heres the Kreplach recipe I make every year for Yom Kippur. My  Grandmother, of blessed memory, a wonderful cook, once told me the only  thing wrong with this Kreplach, was that I didnt make enough of them!    Source: Adat Chaim Sisterhood Cookbook    Combine ground beef, cooked onion, beaten egg and bread crumbs. Put into  refrigerator until ready to use.    DOUGH: beat eggs in water and add slowly to flour and salt. Knead and roll  to form a ball. Divide dough and roll out mixture as thin as possible. Cut  into 2inch squares. Put a small spoonful of filling in each square. Fold  over and stick edges together. Crimp edges with fork. Boil in boiling water  about 30 minutes.    These may be made in advance. Before boiling, place on lightly floured wax  paper cookie sheet and place in freezer until fast frozen. Separate and put  into freezer bag until ready to use. To cook, boil in water before placing  in soup.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by dj-ring@juno.com (David and Janet Ring) on  Aug 30, 1998,
