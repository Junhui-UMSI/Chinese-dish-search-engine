Pralines From the Cajun and Creole Cookbook
Pecan halves, Light brown sugar, firmly, milk, Vanilla extract, Granulated sugar, Heavy cream, 
1 Roughly chop half the pecans and set all the nuts aside. Line 2-3 cookie  sheets with parchment paper.    2 Stir the brown and white sugars, cream and milk together in a heavy-based  saucepan over a medium heat. Stir continuously until the mixture reaches  the soft-ball stage (see Cooks Tip).    3 Remove from the heat immediately and beat with an electric beater or a  balloon whisk until the mixture loses its sheen and becomes creamy in  texture and grainy looking. This could take 15 minutes by hand or about 5  minutes with an electric beater.    4 Stir in the vanilla and both batches of nuts and drop tablespoons of the  mixture onto the lined cookie sheets, allowing it to spread of its own  accord. Allow to cool and set at room temperature. Store between layers of  waxed paper in a tight-lidded tin. Makes about 30 pieces.    COOKS TIP    A mixture has reached the soft-ball stage when a teaspoonful dropped into  cold water quickly sets to a soft ball. As this stage approaches, a  spoonful of the mixture dribbled on the surface of the mixture in the pan  will hold its trail. Test frequently towards the end of the cooking time  unless you are using a sugar thermometer.
