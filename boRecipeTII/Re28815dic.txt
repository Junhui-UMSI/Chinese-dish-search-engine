Thai Chili Paste
Shrimp paste, Turmeric, Dried hot chilies, Shallots, coriander seeds, fresh lemon grass, garlic, fresh ginger, cumin seed, 
Hi Alda...this may use some of your coriander! This curry paste may be  frozen.    Put 1 cup water in a bowl and crumble the dried chilis into it, let soak  for half an hour. Finely chop the ginger and the lemon grass, but with the  lemon grass, cut across the lemon grass into very fine slices and only up  to where the grass gets dry like straw. Pell the garlic and the onion and  chop them coarsely. When the chilies have done soaking,put them and the  water into a blender, and add the othere ingredients...blend until smooth.  This is your basic curry paste, and it may be frozen, thawed and re-frozen  again at least a few times until used up...notice that there is no salt in  this curry paste, the shrimp paste makes up for it.
