Hope  its what youre looking for.    Dissolve sugar and pudding in milk.  Cook, stirring constantly, over low  heat until soft ball forms when dropped in cold water, or until temperature  reaches 234F.  Add nuts and butter, and beat until cool, or until it begins  to thicken. Pour into greased pan or drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. It  will harden as it cools to room temperature.
