This stuff makes the most fantastic toast.  Its also not bad untoasted. We  have made it successfully making the bread as listed, but adding only 1  Tbsp of white sugar and no cinnamon at the beginning, and then adding a  cinnamon/brown sugar mixture 30 s. or a minute before the end of the last  kneading cycle.  The sugar/cinnamon ends up marbled through the bread, and  it is wonderful  (hard to get right though)    >From: Matthew Asplund <ASPLUNDM@PLASMA.BYU.EDU>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : rec.food.recipes
