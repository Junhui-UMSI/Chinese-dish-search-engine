Asparagus Salad W/creme Fraich
Apricot kernel oil, Drained sun-dried tomatoes;, Jumbo asparagus stalks, Creme fraiche or sour cream, Salt, 
1. Snap woody ends off asparagus, peel & trim each stalk. Cook in rapidly  boiling salt water to cover for no more than 1 minute. Drain & plunge into  ice water. When cool, drain spears, and blot dry with paper towels.  Asparagus can be prepared ahead to this stage & refrigerated until serving.  To serve, roll each asparagus spear in apricot kernal oil-it should be very  lightly coated. Arrange the spears in a fan pattern on chilled salad  plates, 5 to a plate. Spoon a dollop of creme fraiche at the apex of each  fan and sprikle with the slivered tomato. To make creme fraiche, combine  two parts heavy cream with 1 part sour cream. Heat to 85F, no higher. Let  mixture stand overnight in a loosely covered glass jar. It should taste  sourish & be quite thick. Creme fraiche will keep 5 to 8 days in the  refrigerator.
