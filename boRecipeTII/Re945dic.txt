Hushpuppies
Cornmeal, Flour, Onion, Baking Powder, Salt, Black pepper, Egg, Buttermilk, Vegetable oil, 
Mix dry ingredients and onion together. Mix in the egg and buttermilk. This  will be a thick mixture. Let sit for 1/2 hour.    Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep skillet/wok to 375 degrees. Drop by  teaspoons into the pan. Fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels,  serve immediately with ketsup, butter, malt vinegar or honey    I also do variations using minced vegetables in the batter and jalapeno  peppers.
