This is a fajita recipe by one of my dads college buddies, Abel Garcia, a  native Texan.  The quantities are party-sized.     Mix all the ingredients of the marinade together, then trim the meat.  Marinade the meat overnight (we put it in big ziplock bags) in the  refrigerator.     Cook over a hot fire on the grill til medium.  Grill the onions too, if  you like (fresh sliced bell peppers are also good). Have the buffet ready  when you start grilling the meat: tortillas, diced tomatoes and onions,  refried beans, guacamole, sour cream, grated cheese, pico de gallo, salsa,  etc. While the meat is still hot off the grill, slice it into strips and  serve.
