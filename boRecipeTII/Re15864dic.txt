*this mojo sauce I have already supplied. it is very easy.     Note this pre-arrangements: clean olives, make 3  short cuts in olives  from top to bottom, very simple. Put the oilives in water with salt during  10/14 days for purging, have a look every 4/5 days. After this process, get  the olives out of water and put them in a recipient...-    In a mortar make a sauce with all ingredients excluding oregon and thyme.  This must be well mashed.  Put olives in a recipent where you are going to  keep for serving and add a little of water...  Add the above sauce -mojo-  and cover the olives with oregon and thyme... Wait 3/4 days to taste...    We do from our olive tree the same, but we mash the olives with a kitchen  wooden hammer, olives are covered with a  clean rag... keeping them in  water with 1 lemon in two parts, with laurel, pepper grains, for 10/14  days... the same as baove.    The sauce is a little different: Garlic + black pepper + oregon + thyme +  some almonds very well mashed + 1 lemon in 3/4 parts + laurel, oilve,  vinegar, water... keeping the olives in this sauce for some days before  serving    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 26 October 96    Date:    Sun, 27 Oct 1996 09:20:46 +0100    From:    Pedro Carroquino <supplies@EXT.STEP.ES>
