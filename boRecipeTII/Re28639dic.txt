Skim off fat, stir in corn meal and simmer  uncovered for 30 minutes, stiring occasionally.  You may vary the spices as  desired, and use whaever type of meat you desire. I buy round steak and  chop it up into small bits., and combine this with lean hamburger. Also  ground pork or venison may be used. If you like you may also add a can of  kidney beans.
