Dennis Beef Jerky
Beef, extra lean *, Soy sauce, Worchestershire sauce, Accent, Garlic powder, Onion powder, Ground red pepper, Seasoned salt, Brown sugar, 
*  Use the leanest beef you can find. Good choices are: Bottom round,  London Broil, round steak, shoulder roast, rump roast. Can be used with  venison, too. Cut beef on bias of grain in 3/16 to 1/4 inch thick strips  (have meat man do this for you). Remove all visable fat before slicing. Fat  will cause the jerky to go rancid faster during storage. Mix all other  ingredients together to make marinade. Submerge meat into marinade,  covering completely. Marinade for 24 hours. Place meat strips directly on  drying racks of food dehydrator with temperature setting at 150=F8. Dry for  20 to 24 hours. Store in air-tight jar or container. Keep in refrigerator  for longer storage.    Original recipe came from Lance Halle but modified by Dennis Thompson.
