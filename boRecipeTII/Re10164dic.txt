Quiche Lorraine #3

Prepare pastry shell as you do any piecrust. Line a 12-inch quiche pan  (ceramic dish produces best results) with pastry shell which has been  rolled out the same thickness as for a pumpkin pie; prick bottom & crumble  bacon over bottom, reserving enough to trim top of the quiche. Add cheese,  alternating both kinds. Combine remaining ingredients, carefully pour over  very slowly, being careful so as not to cause flooding. This amount will  come to within 1 inch of the white dish. Sprinkle bacon over top in a  circle design, sprinkle a little nutmeg in the center. Bake at 325-350 for  35-40 minutes or until almost set in center. Let cool 25 minutes before  serving.    GENEVIEVE J.
