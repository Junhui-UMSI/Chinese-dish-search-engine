Avocado Muffins
Avocado, milk, Margarine, Egg, almonds, DRY MIX, Self-raising flour, WET MIX, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 400F & prepare pans. Cream butter & sugar & beat in the  egg. Blend in the avocado & milk & mix in the nuts. Lastly add the flour &  mix gently but thoroughly until the ingredients are moistened & combined.  Place in pans and sprinkle each muffin with topping. Bake for 20-25 mins.  Makes 10-12.     Note: I also add a little grated lemon rind. Almonds may be toasted  quickly in the microwave or in a dry frying pan, stir constantly to stop  burning. These muffins are one of my favourites.
