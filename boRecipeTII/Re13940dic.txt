Prepare Keftedes Tiganites, but instead of frying, arrange close together  on a baking pan approximately 8 x 11 x 2-inches.  Bake for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a small pan combine the tomato sauce, red wine, bay leaf,  cloves, oregano or marjoram, salt and pepper.  Boil for 5 minutes then pour  over the keftedes in the oven.  Reduce the oven heat to 300 degrees and  bake for 40 minutes.  Remove the bay leaf and cloves and serve warm. From:  "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles, Avenel Books, New York.
