Place pork, sherry, and ginger slice in a 2-quart pan. Cut 1 of the green  onions in half crosswise and add to pork, then add enough water to barely  cover meat.  Bring to a simmer; cover and simmer until meat is tender when  pierced (about 45 minutes).    Lift meat from broth and refrigerate until cold.  Then cut into 1  1/2-inch-square pieces about 1/8 inch thick. (The fatty parts are  considered a delicacy, but remove them if you wish.)    In a bowl, combine hot bean sauce, hoisin sauce, soy, and sugar.  Seed bell  peppers and cut into 1-inch squares; cut remaining green onions into 1-inch  lengths. Place a wok over high heat; when wok is hot, add 2 tbs. of the  oil. When oil is hot, add bell peppers and stir fry for 1 1/2 minutes,  adding a few drops of water if wok appears dry. Sprinkle with salt and stir  once, then remove peppers from wok. Add remaining 1 tbs. oil to wok. When  oil begins to heat, add garlic and minced ginger and stir once; then add  pork and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add bean sauce mixture and toss until pork  is coated with sauce. Return bell peppers to wok along with onion. Stir-fry  for 30 seconds to heat through.
