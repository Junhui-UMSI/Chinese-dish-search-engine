From: Best of the Fairs  Be careful of putting too much of the pineapple juice!!! These are tasty  muffins (I omit the carrots and just use the pineapple...).  Place sugar, oil and eggs in large bowl and beat well. Add flour, baking  powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, mixing well. Add vanilla, pineapple  and grated carrots, mixing well. Bake in greased muffin tins at 350 degrees  F. for 25-30 minutes. Yields 24 muffins.
