Volcanic Hot Sauce
scotch bonnets, Fresh lime juice, Molasses, Dijon style mustard, Turmeric, Garlic, , Distilled white vinegar, Salt, olive oil, 
Combine the pepper, garlic, lime juice, vinegar, mustard, oil, molasses,  turmeric, and slat in a blender and puree until smooth. Correct the  seasoning, adding more salt or molasses to taste.    Transfer the sauce to a clean bottle.  You can use it right away, but the  flavor will improve if you let it age for a few days. Volcanic Hot Sauce  will keep almost indefinitely, refrigerated or at room temperature. Just  give it a good shake before using.    From Steven Raichlens "The Caribbean Pantry Cookbook"
