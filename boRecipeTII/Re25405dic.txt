Tortilla Crepes
Frozen whipped topping;, Cherry or other fruit pie, Flour; (6") tortillas, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. Spoon the pie filling in a line down the center  of each tortilla, distributing it evenly; set aside 1/2 cup for topping.  Roll each tortilla and place seam side down on a baking sheet that has been  coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until  heated through and slightly golden. Allow to cool slightly, then sprinkle  with the confectioners sugar, add a dollop of whipped topping, and top  with the reserved pie filling. Serve immediately.    NOTE: These can also be topped with ice cream or chocolate sauce and  sprinkles, or how about fresh fruit? The choice is yours!
