The recipe for Balmoral Shortbread below is typical  of this style.    However, with Scots cookery, one should never ignore Mistress Margaret  (Meg) Dods. Her "Cooks and Housewifes Manual" was promoted (ghosted?) by  Sir Walter Scott, who coined her pseudonym. The recipe for Petticoat Tails  is described by Catherine Brown (Scottish Regional Recipes) as "a ladies  shortbread - men generally prefer thick fingers".    Other recipes call for additions such as rice flour, cornflour  (cornstarch), lemon peel, ground or slivered almonds (or almond essence)  but these are all just curlicues. As for the commercially produced Choc  Chip Shortbread and Cherry Shortbread ... they are about as Scots as the  Taj Mahal.    Petticoat Tails (based on Meg Dods Manual - see preamble)    Preheat oven to 350F / 180C / Gas 4.    Sift flour and sugar into a bowl.  Add butter and lard, and rub in  completely.  Add caraway seeds; turn out onto a board, and knead till firm.  Roll out to 5mm thickness into a circle (or cut out a circle). Cut in  wedges the size you want and bake for 20-30 minutes until the shortbread is  pale golden brown. Dredge with caster sugar (superfine sugar?) while still  hot.
