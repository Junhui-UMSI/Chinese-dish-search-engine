Thanks for all your good recipes and ideas. Glad youre back today. Will  share a recipe my family enjoys. This was from Good Housekeeping Magazine  several years ago: (Sorry, I have no MasterCook)    (1) In 5-quart saucepan over high heat, heat both kinds of potatoes,  unpeeled and enough water to cover, to boiling. Reduce heat to low, cover  and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender but not soft, about 25 minutes.  Drain. Cool until easy to handle.    (2) Thinly slice onions. In 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat in 1  tablespoon hot salad oil, cook until onions are tender and golden, stirring  constantly. Set aside.    (3) Peel and cut both kinds of potatoes into 1/4 inch thick slices. Preheat  oven to 350.    (4) Prepare sauce: In 2 quart saucepan over medium heat in 3 tablespoons  hot salad oil, cook flour, salt, and pepper 1 minute. Gradually stir in  milk; cook, stirring constantly until sauce thickens and just comes to a  boil 10-15 minutes.    (5) In deep 2-1/2 quart round casserole, alternately layer both kinds of  potatoes, top with half the onions, then 1/3 of the sauce. Top with half  the remaining potatoes, all the remaining onions, and half the remaining  sauce. Arrange remaining potatoes in casserole, top with remaining sauce.    (6) Bake casserole 45 minutes or until gently bubbling and mixture is  heated through. If you like, broil 1-2 minutes to brown top of potatoes  slightly.
