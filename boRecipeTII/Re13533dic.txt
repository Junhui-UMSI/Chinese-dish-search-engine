Whoopie Pies
Heavy cream, Cream of tartar, Vanilla, unsalted butter, Baking soda, Unsweetened Dutch process chocolate, milk, Eggs, for filling, Salt, All purpose flour, Salt, Vanilla, Vegetable shortening, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 2 baking sheets. In a large bowl cream  shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well. In  another bowl sift together dry ingredients. In a glass measure stir  together milk and vanilla. Add dry and liquid ingredients alternately in  batches to egg mixture, beating until smooth after each addition. Drop  rounded tablespoons of batter onto prepared baking sheets about 3" apart,  making sure they are even is size and plump. There should be 24 to 30  individual "cakes". Bake cakes in batches in middle of oven 10 to 12 mins.,  or until tops spring back when touched. Transfer cakes with a metal spatula  to wire racks and cool.    make filling: In a bowl cream butter with sugar, salt, vanilla and 2 tbsp  cream. Add just enough remaining cream so filling is spreadable (you dont  want it drippy). To make whoopie pies, sandwich about 2 tsp filling between  flat sides of cakes and press together lightly. Keep whoopie pies  individually wrapped in plastic wrap or wax paper until ready to serve. (Do  not make more than 1 day ahead.)    NOTES : Original recipe called for filling made with sugar, shortening and  marshmallow fluff (cream, maybe).  Exact measurements were not given.
