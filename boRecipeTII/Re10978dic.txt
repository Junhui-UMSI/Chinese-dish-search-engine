Radicchio and Goat Cheese Gratin with Balsamic Vinegar
Sage leaves, Fresh rosemary leaves, Salt, radicchio, Parmesan cheese, Egg, Balsamic vinegar, Virgin olive oil, Soft goat cheese, 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.    In a large 12 to 14-inch saute pan heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Place the radicchio quarters in the oil 4 at a time and saute cut side down  until lightly brown on both cut sides. Set aside and repeat with the  remaining 4 quarters. Let cool.    While the pan is still hot, saute the 8 sage leaves until crisp and brown,  set aside.    In a mixing bowl stir together the goat cheese, rosemary, egg, Parmesan and  2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar until well blended.    Pack about 3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture on top of each radicchio  quarter, smoothing over to form a slightly rounded top. Bake 10 to 12  minutes or until the goat cheese has started to brown slightly. Remove from  oven, sprinkle with remaining balsamic vinegar and garnish with 2 sage  leaves each. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
