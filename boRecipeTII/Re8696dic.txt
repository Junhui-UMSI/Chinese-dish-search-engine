In a stainless steel or enameled skilet, melt 1/4 pound butter & the oil  over moderately high heat. Add the chicken breasts & cook until lightly  browned. Remove the chicken to a platter & cover with foil to keep warm.  Heat the cognac in the same skillet. Ignite with a match, stirring until  the flame dies. Add the remaining 1 tbs. butter to the pan, allow to melt,  & add the minced shallots. Cook, stirring frequently, until lightly  browned. Return the chicken to the pan. Combine the wine & mustard & pour  the mixture over the chicken. Add salt & pepper to taste. Cover & let  simmer until the breasts are resilient when touched & fork tender, about 15  to 20 minutes. Do not overcook to produce a tough, dry dish. Separately,  mix the egg yolk, lemon juice, & cream together in a small bowl. Pour the  mixture over the breasts in the skillet. Stir this mixture into any liquid  that has formed in the skillet & toss the breasts to coat thoroughly.  Without boiling, continue to cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Place the breasts on  individual heated serving plates & spoon the sauce evenly over each. Serve  with Mousse de Poireaux. (See Recipe)    PETIT CAFE    SEATTLE.
