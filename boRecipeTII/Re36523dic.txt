Strawberries Mousse
Whipping cream, Strawberries, Egg whites, Sugar, Lemon juice, 
Source: From my mother with love& more, Family recipe.    You will need a high mousse dish.    In a electric mix bowl beat egg white with the sugar till white holds. Add  the strawberries and continue to beat for another 10 minutes. It will  become very fluffy. In another bowl cream the whipping cream, and slowly by  hand whisker blend the two together, Cover well with nylon wrap , and  freeze. 1 hour before serving, take mousse out of freezer and let it into  your refrigerator.    (I know the recipe with out the cream, it is quite another story.)    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest Volume 98 #037 by Zvi & Rina Perry  <Pzvi@netvision.net.il> on Jan 21, 1998
