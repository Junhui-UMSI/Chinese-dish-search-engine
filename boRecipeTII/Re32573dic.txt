Sweet Lemon Bread
Baking Powder, Sugar, Flour, butter, Eggs, Salt, milk, juice and rind of 1 lemon, 
Cream butter and sugar.  Beat in eggs.  Sift dry ingredients together and  add to butter alternately with milk.  Mix well.  Stir in lemon juice and  rind.  Bake in greased 9x5x3" loaf pan in preheated 300 degree oven about 1  hour 10 minutes.  Remove from pan to cooling rack.  Pierce top of loaf with  cake tester and pour glaze over bread.  Slice thin and serve.    Glaze:  Juice of 1 lemon and 1/2 cup sugar.  Mix together until sugar is  dissolved and glaze is smooth.    Note:  I make this at Christmas for gifts - everyone loves this bread!    Posted to EAT-L Digest 19 November 96    Date:    Wed, 20 Nov 1996 09:25:49 -0500    From:    "Raymond F.
