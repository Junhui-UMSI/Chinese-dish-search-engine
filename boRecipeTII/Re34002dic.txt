From: Bulldogfla <Bulldogfla@aol.com>    Put on water to boil for pasta; heat oil in non-sick skillet, add onions  and saute for 5 min, without browning; add garlic and orange peel, saute  another minute. Add tomatoes, cut into large cubes, and cook 15 min., stir  occasionally.    While its cooking, add pasta to boiling water, remove and drain when done,  keep warm. If sauce seems watery, cook another few minutes. Add shrimp and  pepper to sauce, cook gently about 3 minutes, til shrimp are pink. Add salt  and freshly ground pepper to taste. Remove orange peel, add basil.    Divide pasta between 2 plates, spoon shrimp and sauce over, sprinkle  w/cheese. Approx 586 cal, 10 g fat. Takes less than 30 minutes to fix.
