Time: 30 minutes (or longer if you want to serve it cold)    1. Start a charcoal or gas grill, or preheat the broiler. Cut the chicken  meat into 1/2- to 1-inch chunks, and thread it onto skewers. Put the  skewers on a plate, and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the soy sauce.    2. In a blender, combine the remaining soy sauce with the peanut butter,  sesame oil, garlic, hot sauce, salt, pepper, sugar and vinegar. Turn the  blender on, and add hot water, a teaspoon at a time, until the mixture is  smooth and creamy. (You will not need more than 3 teaspoons of water.)    3. Grill or broil the chicken, turning once or twice. Total cooking time  will be 6 to 8 minutes for breasts, 10 to 12 minutes for thighs. Meanwhile,  peel the cucumber (if it is waxed), slice it in half the long way, and  scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Cut it into 1/2-inch dice, and combine in  a bowl with the sauce. When the chicken is done, toss it with the sauce and  cucumber. Taste, and adjust seasoning if necessary; then, serve hot or  cold, garnished with the cilantro.    Yield: 4 servings.
