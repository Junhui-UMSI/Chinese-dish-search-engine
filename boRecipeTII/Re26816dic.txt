Lightly oil an 8-inch square baking pan.    2. In a heavy skillet over medium-high heat, saute onion and garlic in  sherry until soft but not browned. Lightly beat egg whites until soft peaks  form. Spoon into a bowl and mix with whole egg, bread crumbs, parsley,  dill, cayenne, cheeses, and artichokes. Add sauteed onion and garlic. Pour  into oiled baking pan.    3. Bake until set (about 30 minutes). Let cool, then cut into about 25  squares. Serve warm or cold. NOTES  : Guests will devour these rich-tasting, melt-in-your-mouth pastries, so  make plenty. Use marinated artichokes for the best flavor, and low-fat  cheeses for the best nutritional value. This recipe can be made up to three  weeks ahead of time and frozen until ready to bake and serve.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.
