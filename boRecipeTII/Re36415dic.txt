In medium-size enamel pot over medium heat, cook sugar  until caramelized and light-brown in colour; remove from heat.  Slowly pour  in beer; liquid will foam and bubble. Mix well with wooden spoon until all  sugar is dissolved. In large bowl, combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt (if  desired); slowly pour in liquid. Mix until ingredients are incorporated and  dough is smooth. Place dough in 9-inch nonstick loaf pan. Bake until  toothpick inserted into bread comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove bread  from oven and let cool on rack. Makes one loaf; 16 slices.

Let me know if you run into the  same problem. This bread was very flavorful. Gold recommends that people  experiment with various types of beer, stout and ale.
