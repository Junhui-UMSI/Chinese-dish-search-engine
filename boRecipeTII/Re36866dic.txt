Date:    Sat, 15 Jun 1996 20:46:43 +0100    From:    Juli in Venice <juli@DOGE.IT>  Since Im single and and I dont like cooking in the summer heat here are a  couple of quick "Venetian" recipes.    Let the rice absorb the flavour of the strawberries.  have some water  boiling in a seperate pot and add a little at a time till the rice is  cooked. At the last minute stir in more fresh strawberries and a little  skim milk. Stir till rice absorbs milk.    Risotto should not be too dry not soupy. The trick is to keep adding just  enough water for the rice to cook but not too little that the rice sticks  to the bottom of the pot or burns!
