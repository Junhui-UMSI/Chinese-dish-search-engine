In a large bowl, combine beans, rice, ketchup and spices. Mash with a fork  or potato masher until beans are well mashed. (Rice will be lumpy.) Add  remaining ingredients and mix well.     Divide mixture evenly and form into 8 burgers, 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. Wet  your hands slightly to avoid sticking.
