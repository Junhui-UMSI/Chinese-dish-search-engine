Pheasant Pate
Pheasants, dressed, Butter, Salt to taste, Sour cream, Black Pepper, Bacon strips, Egg, hard-cooked, Onions, grated, 
Preheat oven to 350F.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on outsides of birds. If  they have been skinned, place bacon strips over them. Bake in a covered  roasting pan in 1/2 inch of water for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. You want the meat  to fall from the bones.    Cool: remove all meat and put through the fine blade of a meat grinder or  use metal blade of food processor to mince finely. Add 1 tablespoon grated  onion, egg and butter. Mix in sour cream to thoroughly moisten mixture and  make it spreadable.  Add salt and pepper; mix well and pack in tightly  closed jars and refrigerate or freeze.
