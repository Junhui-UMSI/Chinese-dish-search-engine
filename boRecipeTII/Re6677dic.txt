Polenta Stuffing
Salt, Mushrooms; sliced/divided, Water, Dried leaf thyme, Unsalted butter; divided, Yellow cornmeal, Fresh ground black pepper, Coriander, Onions; diced/divided, 
Enough for an 8-pound bird.    Melt half the butter in a very large skillet.  Add half the mushrooms and  half the onions and cook over medium heat until onions are soft and  moisture from mushrooms has evaporated, about 15 minutes; set aside in a  bowl. Repeat with remaining butter, mushrooms and onions. Pour water into a  medium pan. Add salt and bring to a boil. Pour in the cornmeal in a slow,  steady stream, stirring constantly, for 15 minutes. Scrape the polenta into  the mushrooms. Add the pepper, thyme and coriander; mix well. Let cool to  room temperature before stuffing bird. Or bake stuffing in a greased,  covered loaf pan in preheated 375-degree oven for       30    minutes.
