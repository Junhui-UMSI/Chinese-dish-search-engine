Prepare the strawberry and orange gelatins separately by dissolving each in  1 cup boiling water; stir until completely dissolved. Add 1/2 cup cold  water to each, then pour each into a separate 8-inch square pan. Chill for  about 1-1/2 hours or until firm, then cut into 1-inch cubes. Cover and set  aside in the refrigerator. Dissolve the lemon gelatin and sugar in 1 cup of  boiling water and stir in the orange juice; chill until slightly thickened  (about 30 minutes). Stir in the pineapple tidbits and whipped topping; mix  well. Fold in the gelatin cubes and pour into a 10-inch tube pan. Chill for  6 to 8 hours or until firm. When ready to serve, dip the tube pan  three-quarters of the way up the sides in hot water for 10 seconds and  invert quickly over a serving plate that is larger than the pan. Gently  shake to loosen from the pan. Cut into 1/2-inch slices.
