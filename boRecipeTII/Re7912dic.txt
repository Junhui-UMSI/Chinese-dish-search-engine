Reduce the heat, partly cover, and simmer until  the beans are slightly soft but not tender all the way through, 45 minutes  to 1 hour and 15 minutes, depending on the age and type of beans.    Add salt and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until the beans are tender  all the way through, easily mashed, and still immersed in the liquid but  not floating freely. Do not drain.
