I made this last night and found it very satisfying ! The original recipe  was in Vegetarian Times but I did modifications to my taste and left out  any oil called for. Quick, easy and tasty this is enough for 4 servings.    Pilaf: In small amount of water (1/4 cup or less) saute pepper, onions and  celery until crisp tender and all water has evaporated then add and stir in  cayenne and cinnamon. Pour in stock or bullion and bring to a boil. Stir in  couscous, cover and remove from the heat. Let sit for 10-15 min until all  liquid has absorbed and grains are swelled. If any liquid remains place pot  on low heat and briefly cook until all liquid has absorbed. Season with  salt, pepper and thyme or mint.    Saffron "Cream" Combine in a blender or food processor.    serve " cream " along with pilaf and a wild greens salad .    Tho the cream is not vegan, I am sure you could find a substitute using  other ingredients with all the ingenious minds this list shares !! ENJOY !!
