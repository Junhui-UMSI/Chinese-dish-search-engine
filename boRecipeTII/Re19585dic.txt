Anns Gorp(Sehr, Sehr Gut - From Ann Armstrong)
Dates, Raisins, Dry roasted peanuts, Sesame nut mix, Sunflower seeds, Gold fish, 
Use your own judgement on how much of each ingredient to use.  I like dates  more than the peanuts, so I use more of those.  Combine all together and  enjoy.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Marie Bordewisch <msleukie@mindspring.com>  on May 27, 1998
