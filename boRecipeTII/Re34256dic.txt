Sprinkle hens with salt & pepper & put them in a baking dish large  enough to hold the hens in one layer. Blend the ginger, mustard,  cumin, garlic, lemon juice & oil with a wire whisk. Brush both sides  of the hens with this mixture. Cover them with plastic wrap &  marinate 3-4 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat broiler to high. Put  the hen halves on broiler pan with high sides. They should be skin  side up & should be placed about 6" from source of heat. Cook until  skin is nicely browned, about 10 minutes. Turn the hens & continue  cooking. Baste them, & continue turning & basting every 5 minutes  until they are done, about 15 minutes longer. Serve with cilantro  sprinkled over all.
