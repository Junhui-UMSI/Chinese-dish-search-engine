Strawberry Jelly - No Sugar
Water, Whole strawberries, Equal or to taste, No sugar fruit pectin, Strawberry kiwi diet snapple, 
Here is another jelly recipe. I prefer it because you can freeze it and it  makes a lot more in a batch. I got it from a recipe insert in the fruit  pectin. Since this uses no sugar, it makes a softer jell than most jams. If  you can have sugar, add 1/8 C. sugar and 8 pkg. equal in place of the 15  pkg., equal. The sugar will improve the color of the finished jelly. If you  want to use all sugar, you can use up to 3 C. but I dont think it needs  that much    Crush strawberries in small layer to make 2 Cups. Mix in snapple and  sweetener. With a wire whisk, slowly mix pectin with water. (Do not pour  pectin into water all at once.) On a med-high burner heat pectin mixture to  boiling stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute. In a large bowl, gradually mix  strawberry mixture into pectin. Make sure it is well combined. Pour into  1/2 C. freezer jars or plastic containers. Chill in refrigerator 12-24  hours until gelled and then freeze. Will keep up to 3 weeks in the  refrigerator. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #204 by dylyn@juno.com  (Lorri Shapiro) on Jun 27, 1997
