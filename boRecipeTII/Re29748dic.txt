Add rice.  Simmer until rice is  cooked.(Note: you may have to add a little more milk)Stir mixture often  while cooking to prevent sticking on bottom of pan. When rice is thoroughly  cooked and mixture is thick, spoon mixture into flat dinner plates. Spread  mixture flat and make small indentions in rice mixture with spoon. Melt 1  stick of butter (1/2 cup) and pour over tops of rice mixture. Sprinkle  generously with cinnamon. Serve warm.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
