Philpott" <colonel@korat1.vu-korat.ac.th>  In the Isan (Northeast Thailand), this dish is sometimes prepared with raw  shrimp This variant is known as pla kung lao (ie shrimp prepared in the  Laotian style). In essence the shrimp are "cooked" in the lime juice, which  induces chemical changes in the shrimp meat. However the dish has a Thai  variant (pla kung korat or simply pla kung) in which the shrimp are  "blanched" in the manner typically used for vegetables.    bai chaphlu are the leaves of a tree with the latin name piper sarmentosum.  In the highly probable situation that you cant find them, garden mint  makes a reasonable substitution.    Tamarind juice is made by adding tamarind pulp to a little water, and  allowing to stand for an hour, then squeezing it through a chessecloth to  filter it.    Drop the shrimp, still with their heads and shells, into boiling water and  blanche for no more than 30 seconds.  De-head and de-vein the shrimp, and  discard all the shells but the tails.  Place the shrimp in a bowl and add  the fish sauce, lime juice, tamarind juice and chili powder, and leave to  marinade for about an hour. Toss with the remaining ingredients to combine.  Garnish with cucumber slices and lime wedges and serve with sticky rice.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #319    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
