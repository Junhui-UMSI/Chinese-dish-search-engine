Tender-Touch Halibut Steaks
Parsley flakes, All-purpose flour, olive oil, Just-for-the-halibut Butter, see recipe, Garlic powder, Halibut steaks, Lemon-pepper seasoning, 
Rinse fish; pat completely dry. Remove skin and cut fish into serving-size  pieces. Combine flour, parsley, lemon-pepper and garlic powder in shallow  plate. Coat fish with seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Heat olive oil in  nonstick skillet. Cook fish over medium-high heat until browned on each  side. Reduce heat and cook about 3 minutes. Turn again; cook about 2  minutes more, or just until fish is opaque and firm. Serve immediately with  just-for-the-halibut butter. Yield: 6 servings.
