Source: Weight Watchers Favorite Recipes Cookbook * Use the sauerkraut that  is packaged in plastic bags and stored in the refrigerator section of the  supermarket; it is usually crisper and less salty than the canned variety.  On rack in broiling pan broil pork chops 6 inches from heat source, turning  once, until rare, 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Remove from broiler and set  aside. Preheat oven to 350 deg. F. Spoon flour into a 20 x 14 inch plastic  baking bag and shake to coat inside of bag; set bag in a 13 x 9 x 2 inch  baking dish. In medium bowl combine sauerkraut, apples, onion, and caraway  seed; spread mixture evenly in bag. In small bowl combine mustard, sugar,  horseradish, salt, and pepper; spread a thin coating of mixture on both  sides of each pork chop. Arrange chops in bag over sauerkraut mixture and  seal bag as manufacturer directs; cut 6 slits in top of bag. Bake until  chops are cooked throughout and tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
