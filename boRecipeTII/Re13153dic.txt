Wonderful Wonder Bars
Bread, Sweet cocoa mix, Ground nuts, Peanut oil, Peanut butter, Wheatgerm, 
Tear the crusts off the slice of bread.  Tear the rest of the slice into 2  pieces.  Leave the bread and the crusts out overnight to that they dry out.  Next day: Crumble the crusts into a large mixing bowl. Add the ground nuts  and wheatgerm. In another bowl, mix the peanut butter and oil until well  blended.  Dip one of the dried bread halves into the peanut butter, then  roll it in the bowl of nuts and wheatgerm.  Enjoy!
