Pound pork or chicken with back of clever to tenderize, then cup it into 1"  cubes. Mix it with A and marinate at least 30 minute, or overnight. Cut  peppers (remove seeds and membranes) into 1" squares. Peel carrot and slice  diagonally into 1/8" thick slices. Peel onion and cut into 1" squares.  Drain pineapple. Set each aside separately. Mix C together in a bowl and  set aside. Heat 4 to 6 cups of oil to deep frying temperature in a deep  skillet or wok. While oil is heating, individually coat each piece of meat,  removing excess marinade, with the 1/2 cup corn starch. When oil is hot,  add meat and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove meat from  skillet and drain well. Put 2 Tbsp. of oil in a clean wok and heat it up  good and hot. A carrot and cook 1 minute, then add onions for 2 minutes,  green peppers for 1 minute and pineapple for 1 minute -- 5 minutes total.  Pour in C and cook until thickened. Turn off heat. Add meat and stir well.  Serve immediately.    NOTES: Special Shrimp marinade -- 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. Chinese cooking wine,  2 egg white, 4 tsp. corn starch * You can substitute arrowroot for corn  starch for a more authentic dish. Reduce amounts use in recipe by half. I  sometimes make a special variation of this by combining two or three of the  meats into Sweet and Sour Three Delights.
