Aunt Anns Ice Box Rolls
Luke-warm water, Flour, Salt, Sugar, Ice water or mixed with milk, Margarine, Envelope dry yeast, 
Dissolve dry yeast in the 1/4 cup luke-warm water. Mix all of the above,  including the yeast/water mixture, until firm. Place in refrigerator over  night. Next day, shape into round walnut-size balls. Put 3 balls in each  cup of greased muffin pan. Let raise until higher than the top of the  muffin pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Tops may be brushed with  butter or margarine if desired. The unbaked dough can be kept in the  refrigerator for 2 weeks.    This is a recipe handed down on my MILs side of the family. Aunt Ann made  them first, then Aunt Mary Mechling, and finally my MIL, Jo Beers.    typos by bobbie beers    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #271    Date: Thu, 3 Oct 1996 18:44:04 -0400    From: BobbieB1@aol.com
