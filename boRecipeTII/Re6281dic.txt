Plain Honey Cake
Baking soda, Flour, Cinnamon, Honey, Baking Powder, Margarine, Eggs, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees    Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan    **Nancis modification...I use Pam or one of those spray cooking oils (no  caloried) and didnt flour the pan. I done this with both the cup cakes and  the bundt pan. The cakes came out beautifully.    Beat eggs and honey together. Add sugar and mix again.    Mix coffee with baking powder, and then add the margarine to the egg  mixture.    Add baking soda, flour, cinnamon and beat together well.    Bake at 325F for 55 minutes to 1hr. Cake is done when tooth pick stuck into  it comes out dry. For the cupcakes the time was around 30 minutes    The main reason I like this cake is there are no nuts, raisins etc. I am  allergic to sulfides, and there are so many folks I know that dont like  the nuts or the fruit. I got tired of making fancy honey cake, loaded with  "goodies", only to have folks pick them out.    I usually make this in cupcake form, and freeze them in Ziplock type bags.  I have had no problems defrosting them.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #018    From: Nancy Jeann Dephia <batdance@netcom.com>    Date: Tue, 10 Sep 1996 11:54:11 -0700 (PDT)
