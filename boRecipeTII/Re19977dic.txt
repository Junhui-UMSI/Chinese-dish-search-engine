Apple Butter Stack Cake
All-Purpose Flour; sifted, Sugar, Vanilla, Eggs, Butter, 
Cream butter and sugar at least 10 minutes by hand, or 5 minutes in  electric mixer. The mixture should be thick and white. Add eggs one at a  time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. If the bakers  ammonia is in granular form, crush to a powder with a rolling pin or a  bottle. Sift flour and bakers ammonia together. Stir flour into egg mixture  and blend thoroughly. Dough will be soft. Chill for at least 30 minutes.    Cut 6 to 8 -- 8" rounds from waxed paper. Spread the dough thinly and  evenly on paper rounds, leaving about half-inch margin to allow for  expansion during baking.    Place to or three round (whatever it will hold) on a baking sheet. Bake at  400? 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown on edges. Remove at once from  cookie sheet, but do not remove paper until you are ready to assemble cake.  Assemble by placing well-spiced apple butter between each layer. Leave top  unadorned.    *The bakers amonia (ammonium carbonate or hartshorn) may be bought at  drugstores. Or 3 3/4 tsp baking powder may be substituted.
