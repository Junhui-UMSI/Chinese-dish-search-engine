Place the fowl in a large pot with water and bring to a full boil; skin  surafce of water until clear. Lower heat and add remaining ingredients  except vinegar and let gently simmer until chicken is sufficiently tender  to remove easily from bone. Remove chicken and let stand until cool enough  to remove meat and skin from bone. Add bones and vinegar to stock in pot  and let simmer an additional hour. Cool, then strain into a large bowl and  add chicken meat. Refrigerate until fat comes to surface; remove and  discard fat.    *** TO MAKE THE FRICASSEE ***    * - cut into bite-sized pieces.    1. Melt the butter in a large, heavy saucepan or deep skillet and stir in  the flour. When bubbly, slowly add the heated chicken stock, stirring. Add  cream and continue to cook, stirring until sauce is thick. Add chicken meat  and cook, stirring a final 5-10 minutes.    2. Southerners usually serve fricassee over cooked white rice, but it is  also great over baking-powder biscuits with a thin slice of baked ham  placed on each biscuit half before the fricassee is spooned over.
