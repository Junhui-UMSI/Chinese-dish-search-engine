Pork with Fermented Bean Curd
Dry sherry, Scallions, rinsed,, Garlic, mashed, Boneless pork (loin, Soy sauce, Chicken broth, Pcs fermented bean curd, Water, 
Bring liquids to a boil. Add pork, garlic, and soy. Reduce heat and  simmer 30 min, skimming crud off occasionally. Slice the scallions  into 1" pieces and dump them in. Add the bean curd and mash it around  until its incorporated in the sauce. Add sherry (if you use more  bean curd, use less sherry; if you use less bean curd, use more  sherry). Continue to simmer until pork is tender, 15 to 30 min more.  You may put a slice or two of ginger in with the garlic, but my  mother never did that.    This dish should have visible fat. The sauce should be thin and have a  slightly curdled look to it. To pay lip service to western  sensibilities, you might consider serving it surrounded with a  stir-fried green vegetable (my mother used spinach). Warning: do not  even think of making this dish with totally lean meat! It just wont  work - the meat will be stringy and tasteless. Butt or fresh bacon is  the traditional way, but the fattier and gristlier ends of loin,  after all the stir-fryable parts have been cut away, will do.
