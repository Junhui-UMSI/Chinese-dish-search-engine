Keftes De Prassa Y Carne (Meat And Leek Patties)
From: Gaye Levy DTXT63A, COOKING THE SEPHARDIC WAY, Ground meat, Leeks; cooked; squeezed &, Potatoes; mashed, Eggs, Salt, Black Pepper, Oil; to fry, 
This dish is traditionally served for Passover.    Wash, cut up and parboil leeks approximately 10 minutes or until tender.  Drain off all water, squeeze, and chop very fine. Mix leeks with remaining  ingredients. Shape into small patties and fry.    Note: Our family always makes these in advance. After cooking, lemon juice  is poured over and they are refrigerated. They taste delicious when  reheated the next day.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Nov  09, 1998,
