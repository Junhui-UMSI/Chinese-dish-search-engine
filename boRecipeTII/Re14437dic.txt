Whole Wheat Pancakes
milk, Baking Powder, Egg, brown sugar, Whole wheat flour, Vegetable oil, Salt, 
Grease the griddle if not well seasoned or non-stick. Heat the griddle  while mixing the batter (water sprinkled on it should bounce when its  ready to use). Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Beat egg,  milk, sugar, and oil together. Add the liquid mixture to the flour mixture,  sitrring only to moisten the dry ingredients (batter should be slightly  lumpy). For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the hot griddle.  Cook until the pancake is covered with bubbles and its edges are slightly  dry. Turn and brown the other side.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Rottmayer <rottmayer@WORLDNET.ATT.NET> on Feb  23, 1998
