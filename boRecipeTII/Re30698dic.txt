FOR THE QUAIL:    Split the quail, carefully remove the back and rib bones and brush with  tamarind glaze. Grill the quail over a medium-hot fire 4 to 5 minutes, skin  side down. Turn and grill another 2 to 3 minutes, taking care not to  overcook.    Place purslane salad attractively on plates. Place grilled quail on top and  garnish with mint sprigs, arugula and flower petals.    FOR THE GLAZE:    In a small skillet over medium heat, saute the garlic, shallots and ginger  in olive oil until tender but not brown. Stir the sugar, fish sauce, water,  tamarind concentrate and the lime juice together until well combined. Add  to the garlic mixture and reduce over high heat by one-third or until  slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and let cool. Store covered in the  refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.    Yield: About 1/2 cup    FOR THE SALAD: Wash the purslane and discard any tough stems or damaged  leaves. Chop the onion and bell pepper and rinse in cold water. Place the  onions and peppers in a bowl along with the purslane leaves, tomatoes,  sumac, chile, lemon juice and olive oil. Gently mix and season with salt  and pepper and garnish with roasted beets.
