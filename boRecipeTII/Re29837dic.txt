Begin preparation by deboning and removing the tendons and fat from the  meat. It is important that you remove all fat or it will go rancid. Either  grind the meat yourself or have someone grind it for you; a coarse grind  gives the best results. Mix the spices thoroughly and then add the spices a  bit at a time while kneading the meat like dough. Put the meat in the  fridge for at least 6 hours to allow the spices to work through the meat.  At this point you prepare the meat for jerking. If you have an electric  meat slicer, make the meat into logs about 4 x 14"; place the meat in the  fridge until it is solid but not frozen, and then slice 1/8" slices from  end to end. Youll end up with a big stack of circular patties. If you  dont have a slicer, roll the meat out to a 1/8" thickness between two  pieces of wax paper. Remove the top paper and score the meat into strips  and place them in the freezer for about 45 minutes. Remove the meat and  break at the score marks. Place the jerky on wire racks and place them in a  150 F. oven, leaving the door ajar so moisture can escape and the heat does  not build up. Turn the jerky once or twice during drying and rotate the  racks if the jerky near the elements begins to dry too fast. Meat should be  left slightly pliable, that should take somewhere around 3 or 4 hours to  get to. Cure yours to whatever point you like; if you like potato chips, be  my guest. Jerky can can be stored for months in the freezer; the drier it  is the longer it lasts. Makes 1 happy camper.
