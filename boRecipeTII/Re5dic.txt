Jalapeno Poppers
Fresh green and/or red jalapenos, Cheddar cheese, Cream cheese, Dried Italian Seasoning, Eggs, milk, Flour, Seasoned bread crumbs, 
Cut each pepper in half lengthwise.   Remove seeds and membranes*.  When removing the stem, be sure to leave tops intact as to form a bowl.    Stir together cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and Italian seasoning in a  medium mixing bowl! Spoon some of the cheese mixture into each pepper half, slightly mounding it.   Beat together eggs and milk in a small mixing bowl.  Dip each pepper into flour mixture, then dip each pepper into egg mixture  and roll in bread crumbs! Shake off crumbs, then dip in egg and bread crumbs one more time.  Place pepper halves, filled side up, on a large baking sheet covered with foil.  Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes or till  tender and heated through. Serve with guacamole or sour cream if desired.  Makes 20 poppers. If you should decide to deep fry, make sure poppers are  well chilled so the cheese doesnt ooze all over your fryer.
