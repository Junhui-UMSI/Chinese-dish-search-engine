Drain beans, add stock, garlic, and bay leaf and bring to a  boil. Reduce heat and simmer covered until beans are almost tender, about  45 minutes. While beans are cooking, heat oil in a medium skillet; add  onion, garlic, celery, and carrots, saute for 5 to7 minutes until softened.  Rinse out skillet with 1 cup water and add to soup along with tomatoes and  simmer together for 20 minutes. Add zucchini, green beans, cabbage or  chard, and oregano and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in macaroni and cook until  pasta is tender, about 10 minutes. Remove bay leaf. Add salt and pepper to  taste. Top each serving with a spoonful of pesto sauce and Parmesan.
