Bechamel Sauce #2
Nutmeg, milk, Butter, All-purpose unbleached flour, salt and pepper, 
Combine butter and flour in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking  constantly with a wire whip until the flour smells cooked (it will have no  smell until it is cooked) and it is light golden color. Remove roux from  heat.     Bring milk to a simmer in another saucepan. Using the wire whip,  thoroughly incorporate the roux into the milk. Add nutmeg, salt and pepper.  Strain the sauce through a sieve until there are no tiny lumps. Dot the top  of the sauce with melted butter to prevent skim from forming.     This sauce is used to make "Sauce Nantua" and "Broccoli with Mornay Sauce"  (both in this cookbook).
