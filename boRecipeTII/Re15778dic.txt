Abm Rice Bread
Veg oil, Water, Ground Rice Crispies, Salt, Yeast, All purpose flour, Sugar, 
It takes about 2 cups of Rice Crispies  to make 1 cup of ground rice in the  blender.    Add liquid ingredients, then dry ingredients, then yeast. Set machine for  regular/basic and medium crust. Watch the first mixing and add more flour  if necessary for the dough to form a ball that lifts from the tub.
