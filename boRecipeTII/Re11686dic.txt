Raspberry Vodka Cordial
Red raspberries, Sugar, Vodka, Water, Glycerin, 
Put the raspberries into a large, shallow dish and mash with a fork or  potato masher. Transfer the fruit and its juice to a 1-quart Mason jar and  cover with the vodka. Seal the jar, shake to mix, and set it aside in a  cool, dark place for 6 weeks. Strain the contents of the jar through a fine  sieve into a 4-cup glass measuring cup. Discard the fruit; rinse the sieve  and the Mason jar thoroughly. Fit the sieve with a damp coffee filter and  strain the flavored vodka back into the jar. Combine the sugar and water in  a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the  sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, or until  a clear syrup forms. Remove the pan from the heat and cool to room  temperature. Add the cooled syrup and the glycerin to the liqueur. Reseal  the jar and shake gently to blend. Using a funnel, divide the liqueur  between two 10-oz decanters. The Raspberry Vodka Cordial should be ready to  drink in 2 or 3 days and has a shelf life of 2 to 3 months.    YIELD: 20-oz (2 1/2 cups)    Recipe by: Homemade in the Kitchen Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #216  by Sean Coate <swcoate@peganet.com> on Sep 03, 1997
