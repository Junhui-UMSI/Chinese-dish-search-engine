Combine water and sugar in large bowl.  Sprinkle yeast over mixture and  let stand 10 minutes.      Add powdered milk, sugar, salt, shortening, and 3 cups flour. Beat til  smooth.  Then add enough of the remaining 3 cups flour to make a soft  dough.  Turn out on a floured board and let rest 5 minutes.      Knead until smooth using only enough flour to keep from sticking to  board.  Put into greased bowl, turning once to coat. Place in slightly  warmed oven (turn on for count of 30 to 60, turn off) and let rise til  doubled - about 1 hour.      Turn out onto floured board.  Divide for loaves, roll out into rectangle,  then roll up again, tightly. Place in greased loaf pans, tucking ends  under.  Let rise in warm oven again for 3/4 hour until doubled in size.      Bake at 400F for 40 to 50 minutes til brown, cool on wire rack, enjoy.      (Best reconstruction I can make of a badly faded recipe card. ;-))
