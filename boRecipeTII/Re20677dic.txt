I hope it works for  you.    Mix water and lemon juice: sprinkle over apples.  Place in large, flat  baking dish (the more spread out the apples are, the crispier the  coating--otherwise, the size pan is not terribly important).    Mix the last four ingredients until crumbly.  Spread over apples.  Bake at      350    degrees 35-40 minutes.    Thanks to Nola Hall.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
