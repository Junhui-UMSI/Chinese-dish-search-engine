Apple Compote
Ground cinnamon, Butter, Lemon juice, Sugar, Golden delicious apples, 
from <<Faye Levys International Jewish Cookbook>>    Instead of applesauce with latkes, this can be served as a chunky topping  or pureed into a flavorful fresh applesauce. When the apples are left in  pieces, the compote can be served as a dessert on its own; its especially  good served hot with ice cream, sour cream, or yogurt.    Peel & halve the apples. Core & cut into thin wedges or slices.    Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add apples & saute, turning  pieces over from time to time, for about 2 minutes or until they are coated  with butter. Add lemon juice and cinnamon, cover & cook over low heat for 5  minutes, or until liquid begins to come out of the apples. Uncover &  continue cooking over low heat, gently stirring occasionally, for 15-20  minutes or until apples are tender and begin to fall apart.    Add 2 tbsp sugar & saute over medium-high heat, turning apples over, about  2 minutes or just until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Taste & add more  sugar if necessary; heat, tossing apples gently, until sugar dissolves.  Serve warm or at room temperature to accompany latkes.    Can be kept covered in refrigerator for 2 days.
