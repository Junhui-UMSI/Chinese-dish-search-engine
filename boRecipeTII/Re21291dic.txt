Unadulterated Black Bean Soup
Yellow onion, Red onion, Salt, Ham hocks, Dry sherry, Sour cream, Black Pepper, Chives, Water, Dried black beans, 
This recipe is from Katherine Hall PAges "The Body in the Cast" (St  Martins Press, 1993, $19.95). Its from heroine Faith Fairchilds  cookbook, called "Have Faith in Your Kitchen." Faith notes that the  soup tastes better if made a day ahead.    Pick over beans, cover with cold water and bring to boil for 2  minutes. Remove from heat and let stand at least 1 hour. (Or soak  beans overnight, changing water several times.)    Drain beans and place in a large pot. Rinse the ham hocks. Peel and  quarter the onions. Bury hocks and onions in the beans. Add 7-8 cups  water and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer 1 1/2 to 2  hours. Be sure the beans are soft.    Remove the hocks or bone and strip any meat from them. Add the meat  to the soup and puree in batches in a blender. (Note: A food  processor sometimes leaks with this much liquid.) Put the pureed soup  in a clean pot; warm, adding the seasonings and wine, if using. Serve  with a dollop of sour cream and finely minced chives.
