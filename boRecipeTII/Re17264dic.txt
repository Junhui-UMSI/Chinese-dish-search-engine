Waffles #2
Flour, Baking Powder, Finely chopped pecans, Eggs, Sugar, Salt, Butter, milk, Beer, 
Combine flour, baking powder, salt & sugar. Separate eggs. Beat egg yolks;  add milk & beer. Add chopped pecans & dry ingredients & mix just enough to  blend. Add melted butter. Allow batter to stand overnight to permit  fermentation of beer. Just prior to baking waffles, beat whites of eggs  until stiff & fold into batter. Pour enough batter into waffle iron so that  waffle will rise & contact entire surface, browning evenly. Bake & serve.  Yields about 6-8 waffles.    COL GARY C.
