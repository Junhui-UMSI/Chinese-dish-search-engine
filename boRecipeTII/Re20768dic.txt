Apple Dumplings - Cock N Bull Part 2 of 2 - Dough
Shortening, Ice water, Salt, Dry milk, Flour, 
Sift flour, dry milk and salt into a bowl. Remove 1/2 cup of the flour  mixture and set aside. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut the  shortening into the bowl of flour mixture until particles are the size of  peas. Make a paste of the 1/2 cup flour mixture and ice water. Sprinkle  over the flour-shortening mixture. Using a fork, quickly blend together  until the flour is moistened and can be pressed into a ball. Roll out on a  lightly floured surface to about 1/12" thickness. Cut out 6 - 5" x 5"  squares.
