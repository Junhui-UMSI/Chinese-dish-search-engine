Honey Whole Wheat for the Large Panasonic Model
Salt, Whole wheat flour, Unbleached white flour, Cornmeal (I use masa, Harina), Gluten, Nonfat dry milk, Honey, Water, Yeast, 
This recipe is for bread machines, in particular, the 1.5 lb panasonic  machine.    Place all ingredient except yeast in the pan.  Place yeast in the  dispenser. Program for Whole Wheat (for dark crusty crust) or Basic Bread  (lighter crust) and press start.  Wait 3-4 hours.  This makes a        2 lb loaf.    I find Red Star Active Dry Yeast to be the best.  When I was actively  baking, Id get it in 2lb packs from the wholesale warehouse stores and  keep it in the frige (much cheaper that way).  Adding gluten (vital wheat  gluten or gluten flour, not hi-gluten flour) to whole wheat breads really  helps a lot.  The bran in whole wheat bread inhibits the formation of the  long protein gluten strands that trap gas bubbles and give bread its  spongyness.  Adding more gluten to compensate makes whole wheat breads  lighter.  Try 1-4 T per loaf.
