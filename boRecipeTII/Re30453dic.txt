Banana Loaf (Vegan)
bananas, Ground flax seed, Salt, Flour, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Water, Applesauce, Brown sugar, 
"Cream" applesauce and brown sugar, add flax mixture. Mash bananas and  baking soda together, add to the other mixture. Mix dry ingredients  together. Stir wet and dry to moisten. Use a 9 x 5 inch loaf ban (nonstick  or sprayed with Pam). Cook at 350 (175C) for about an hour until it passes  the toothpick test.    Note: I usually add some vanilla as well. Its supposed to make 16  servings, but they are paper thin slices--so Id guess 8-10 real people  servings. I havent tried freezing it yet.
