Cincinnati (Greek) Vegetarian Chili
Garlic, Water, Tomato paste, Chili powder, Cinnamon, Salt, Paprika, Black pepper, Oregano, Cumin, Allspice, Cloves, Nutmeg, Bay leaf, Bulgar wheat, Onion, Celery, Carrot, 
In a heavy saucepan, saute onion, celery, and carrot (I use bassmatic  vinegar).  Stir in garlic and cook another minute. Add water, tomato paste  and spices. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 min. Add bulgar  wheat and cook another 30 min.  Add more water if necessary. Remove bay  leaf before serving. Serving suggestions: on spaghetti topped with chili  and ff cheddar cheese, onions and/ or pinto beans. You could add other  vegetables such as zucchini, peppers or onions, and top with yogurt.  Purists demand oyster crackers.(not low fat) Mary M Loos <loos@sed.psrw.com  Posted on NVN by RCROCKETT    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Robert Ellis" <rpearson@snowcrest.net> on  Oct 23, 1998
