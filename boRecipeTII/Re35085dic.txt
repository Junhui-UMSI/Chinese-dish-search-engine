Bears Buffaloo Wings
Sticks butter, Texas pete; Crystal, you, Fresh ground pepper, Chicken wings, 
Cut the 40lb of wings up. Drumette, middle section, tip    Ahemm discard tips or make into stock.    Deep fry the wings until the outside is chewy. You can flour the wings if  ya want a lil crust. Wings should be safely edible at this point.    In a pot melt butter add everything but dressing.    Bring up to a good simmer add dressing. Cook until cheese lumps dissolve to  an even texture (you can still have small bb size or bigger lumps) The  addition of more or less dressing will increase or decrease the heat of the  wings to a point. Some should always be used. If ya want it hotter add some  habeneros, its your life.    Sauce the wings (tupperware bowl with lid and shake, individually with  tongs, in a bag, in a garbage can all at once, in a garbage bag all at  once, you get the idea)    Smoker should be going, I also did this for years on the brinkman bullet (  no water pan grill on top charcoal pan at lowest height) put in wings at  200 to 300 degrees and smoke with MESQUITE until sauce it totally adhered  to the wings. You can touch them without getting a totally sauce covered  finger.    Serve with Blue cheese dressing (Maries is the best Ive had) for dipping.  I dont bother cutting up no damn celery. Eat more wings.    I hope whoever tries them enjoys them as much as my people do.    Posted to bbq-digest by Bear <bear@fred.net> on Jan 15, 1997
