Basil Smoked Shrimp and Scallop Kebabs
Peeled and deveined, Sea scallops (about 12), Chopped fresh basil (leaves, Applewood chips, Large shrimp (about 12),, And stems), 
Soak the applewood chips in water for 1 hour.    Soak four 6-inch amboo skewers in water for 15 minutes. Thread the shrimp  and scallops alternately onto each skewer.    Line a wok or a straight0sided fry pan with a double thickness of aluminum  foil.  Drain the applewood chips and combine them with the basil in the  bottom.  Insert a low rack that wil keep the skewers raised, but still  allow a cover to fit.    Place the skewers across the rack and cover the pan. If using a wok, ring 2  wet towels around the cover; for a fry pan, drape a wet towel over the  cover and secure tightly.    Smoke the kebabs for 15 minutes over medium-high heat. Remove the pan from  the heat and set it aside for 5 minutes before uncovering. Serve  immediately.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #208    Date: Thu, 01 Aug 1996 18:46:21 -0800    From: "Jenny S.
