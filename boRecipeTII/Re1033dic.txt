Cocoa Snaps
All-purpose flour, Sugar, Unsweetened cocoa powder, Baking Powder, Salt, Unsalted butter; softened, Egg; beaten lightly, 
In a bowl whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt  and with fingers blend in butter until incorporated. Stir in egg until  mixture is combined well. Cover dough in bowl and chill until firm, about 1  hour.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees and lightly grease a large baking sheet.    Spoon level tablespoons of dough onto a sheet of wax paper and cut each in  half. With floured hands roll each piece of dough into a ball and arrange,  evenly spaced, on baking sheet. Flatten each ball with a floured metal  spatula into a disk about 2 inches in diameter and bake in middle of oven 7  to 8 minutes, or until cookies are set but not hard. Cool cookies on  racks.(Cookies will continue to crisp as they cool.) This recipe yields  about 26 cocoa snaps.
