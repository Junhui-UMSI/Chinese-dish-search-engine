1.  Trim rib of each cabbage leaf very thin.  In 11" by 7" baking dish,  cook cabbage leaves and 2 tablespoons water, covered, on High 8 to 10  minutes until tender; drain. Set aside.    2.  In 2-quart casserole, cook oil and onion, covered, on High 3 minutes.  Add mushrooms; cook, covered, 3 to 4 minutes until tender. Stir in uncooked  rice, cheese, salt, and pepper.    3.  On center of each cabbage leaf, place about 1/3 cup rice mixture. Fold  bottom of leaf over filling; fold sides toward center. Roll tightly,  jelly-roll fashion.    4.  In 11" by 7" baking dish, arrange cabbage rolls seam-side down. Pour  spaghetti sauce over cabbage rolls. Cook, covered, on High 8 to 12 minutes  until tender, rotating dish halfway through cooking. Sprinkle rolls with  mozzarella cheese; let stand, covered, 3 minutes. Makes 8 cabbage rolls.    Each roll: About 225 calories, 9 g fat, 8 mg cholesterol, 495 mg sodium.    Note:  I find that this was relatively bland, so I tend to add lots more  pepper and a bit more parmesan cheese to the mixture.    This recipe was from Good Housekeeping, Jan 1992.
