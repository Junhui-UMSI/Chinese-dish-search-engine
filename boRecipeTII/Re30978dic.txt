Tarragon Beef and Pasta Salad
Salt, Mayonnaise  or salad, Plain yogurt, Celery; sliced 1/4" thick, Fresh parsley, Fresh tarragon; chopped, Medium shell macaroni;, Red onion; sliced 1/4" thick, Cherry tomatoes; halved, Pepper, Roast beef, cooked; sliced, 
Cook macaroni according to package directions.  Rinse with cold water,  drain, and refrigerate.    In a large bowl, stir together beef, celery, tomatoes and red onions  (separated into rings).  Stir into macaroni.  Refrigerate at least one  hour.    In another bowl, stir together yogurt (I use non-fat), mayo or salad  dressing (I use light salad dressing), parsley, chives, tarragon (can  substitute 1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon for fresh), salt and pepper.  Cover  and refrigerate at least 1 hour.    Can be served one of 2 ways:    1.  Place onto plates or into bowls, and pour a spoonful of dressing over  top, without mixing it together.    2.  Pour dressing over the entire salad and serve in a large bowl.    This is even great as a vegetarian dish.
