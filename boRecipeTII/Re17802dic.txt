Almost Dreamland Barbeque Sauce
Lemon juice, Dark corn syrup, Paprika, Ground red pepper, Brown sugar, Black Pepper, Cider vinegar, Dry mustard, Onion powder, Chili powder, Yellow mustard, Sugar, Salt, Water, Garlic powder, tomato puree, 
And without further teasing, here is the "Almost-Dreamland" reacipe which  was concocted by a writer for "Mens Journal" that is declared to be very  close to the real recipe by Ms. Bishop-Hall:    In a large saucepan, whisk together tomato puree and mustard until smooth.  Stir in remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and  simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve warm. Sauce may be  refrigerated for several weeks.    Note: I am not financially attached either to the Birmingham News (I do  have a subscription for which I pay) nor Dreamland Barbeque (though I have  been seen eating at both locations occasionally).
