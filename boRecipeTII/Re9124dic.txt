Generously grease 6 cups of a popover pan.  Put the pan in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees.  Remove the pan from  the oven as soon as it is hot.    Stir together the flour and salt. Whisk in the milk, eggs and melted  margarine until the mixture is smooth. Do not overbeat. Stir in the  prosciutto and orange peel. (The batter can be prepared an hour in  advance.)     Ladle the batter into the hot pan and bake in the preheated oven 15  minutes.  Turn the heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake 15-20 minutes,  until puffed and browned. Never open the oven door during the baking time  as the popovers will deflate.     Remove from the oven and run a knife around each popover. Remove from the  pan and pierce each with a knife.
