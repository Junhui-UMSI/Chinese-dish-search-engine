Pour milk into a heavy saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean; add seeds  and bean to milk. Cook over low heat 20 minutes; discard vanilla bean.    Combine 1/4 cup sugar and cornstarch; add to milk mixture, stirring well.  Gradually stir about one-fourth of hot milk mixture into egg yolk; add to  remaining hot milk mixture, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil over  medium-high heat, stirring constantly.    Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly (mixture will not be thick). Pour into a  bowl; cool slightly, and cover surface with plastic wrap. Chill thoroughly  (mixture will thicken slightly).    Coat a 1-quart metal bowl with cooking spray; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon  sugar. Set aside.    Beat egg whites (at room temperature) at high speed of an electric mixer  until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating  until stiff peaks form. Add vanilla extract, and beat 10 seconds. Spoon  mixture into prepared bowl; gently smooth surface of mixture with a  spatula. Place bowl in an 8-inch square baking pan; add hot water to pan to  a depth of 1 inch. Bake at 325 deg for 20 minutes or until slightly puffed  and set.    Invert island into a shallow dish. Pour sauce around island, and sprinkle  with grated chocolate. Yield: 5 servings (serving size: 1 wedge and 1/2 cup  sauce).
