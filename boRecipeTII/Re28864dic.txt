This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With  this recipe its necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when  buying.    Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch  lengths.    Chill.    Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it  loses its pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt  and pepper to taste.  Cool.    Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp  and chilled noodles; mix well.    Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp  fried shallots.    Serves 4 to 6.    NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.    San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.    As far as the crisp fried shallots go, theyre easy to make.  Just  fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until theyre browned and  crisp.  I wouldnt hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in  the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor  accent. Good stuff!
