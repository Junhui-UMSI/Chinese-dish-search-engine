Brunches, I usually serve a fruit salad, I make a  very exotic salad with three dressings to choose from...If you want the  dressings let me know, a Honey Baked Ham, smoked turkey, condiments, and a  variety of breads and muffins. People can make sandwiches if desired. The  egg recipe is as follows:Melt butter, add flour and milk. Cook until thick,  add 1 cup grated cheese. Add chopped hard boiled egg yolks. Halve eggs,  stuff with mix, top with sauce in pan and bake at 325 for 20 to 30 min. Can  be made ahead and baked later. Any questions please send to my private box.
