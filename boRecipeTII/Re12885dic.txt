In a large enameled cast iron or other flameproof casserole, heat the olive  oil over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, and peppers and cook for 5  minutes, or until softened. Stir in the prosciutto and cook for 3 minutes  more, stirring occasionally. Add the tomatoes and increase the heat to  mediumhigh. Stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from scorching, cook  until the liquid from the tomatoes has evaporated. Stir in the ground  almonds, saffron, thyme, rosemary, salt, black pepper, and red pepper  flakes, and wine. Reduce the mixture until the wine has almost all  evaporated. Add the fish stock and lemon juice, bring the mixture to a boil  and add the clams and mussels. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan and  cook for 10 minutes. Add the shrimp, scallops, and squid and cook for 5  minutes more, by which time all of the shellfish should have opened. Remove  and discard any that have not. Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary,  and serve straight from the casserole into heated soup bowls, garnished  with a wedges of lemon and toasted bread. Yield: 6 servings Note: To grind  almonds, freeze 2 ounces of blanched, slivered almonds and then pulse them  in a food processor only until finely ground. Do not overprocess or they  can become oily.
