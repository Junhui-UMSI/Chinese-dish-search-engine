Hash Browns
Potatoes, boiled and cooled, Onion, Salt, Pepper (or to taste), Butter, Bacon fat Or vegetable oil, 
Shred boiled and then slightly cooled potato.  (should measure about        4    cups)    Combine the potatoes, onion, salt and pepper in a bowl.    Heat butter and oil in a 10 inch skillet.    Transfer potato mixture to the skillet, leaving about a 1/2 inch space  around the edge.  Cook over low heat until bottom crust is brown, 10 ~ 15  minutes.    Cut potato mixture into fourths, flip sections, adding more oil if  necessary. Continue cooking until other side is brown, 12 - 15 minutes.    The potatoes can be kept in one piece if you invert the potatoes onto a  plate and then carefully slide back the potatoes into the skillet.
