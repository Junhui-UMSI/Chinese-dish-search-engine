Ranch Bread (For Bread Machine)
ranch dressing, Bread flour, Yeast, Salt, water, Sugar, 
Place all ingredients, except yeast, into bread basket in the order given.  Place yeast in yeast dispenser. Set for basic bake, sandwich mode. This  will take four hours.    Note: These directions I adapted for my Panasonic with separate yeast  dispenser...you may need to change them for the brand of abm you have.    Another note: When I make the yummy Knorr spinach dip, I will make this on  the dough setting. I then take it out, shape it into a round shape, let it  raise, and bake it. Its perfect to hollow out and fill with dip, and the  cubes are wonderful dipped in the spinach mixture.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H. Frye" <shfrye@PEN.K12.VA.US> on Feb  4, 1998
