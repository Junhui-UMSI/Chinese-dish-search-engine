Serves 1 Starving or 2 Hungry Students    Its that time of the year, again. The pencils, pens, and stacks of  notebooks have already started to crowd the stores as the aisles spill over  with fresh-faced buyers surveying the goods that will get them back in  business. It can only mean that summer vacation is coming to an end and  its about time to head back to school.    If youve got a college-bound student in the family, or just want some  easy-to-use recipes in your collection, The Cook and Kitchen Staff have  some fresh ideas for you as offered from our "Back-to-School" recipe  collection.    Rinse the chicken breasts, remove skin, and de-bone if not already done.    In a small mixing bowl, lightly beat the egg with a fork or whisk. Add  pepper, oregano, and tarragon to the egg, and blend again.    Place bread crumbs in a plastic bag. Dip each chicken breast in the egg  mixture, then place in the bread crumb-filled plastic bag. Shake the bag  until the chicken breasts are covered with the bread crumbs.    Place chicken breasts on a non-stick baking sheet (or spray the baking  sheet), and spray the chick with a non-stick vegetable oil. Bake chicken in  a pre-heated oven set at 350-F degrees for 45 minutes. Serve warm with soup  and/or salad.    Kitchen Staff Tip: What sort of kitchen supplies will your college student  require? As a bare minimum we recommend you stock the kitchen a large  nonstick skillet, two all-purpose saucepans, one baking or cookie sheet,  two spatulas, one each wooden and slotted spoon, a ladle, a can opener, and  one broad, flat cutting knife paired with a small utility or paring knife.  A small variety of plastic containers is always handy for mixing and  storing prepared foods.
