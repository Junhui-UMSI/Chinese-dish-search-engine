Precooked Wheat Berries (Mf)
Wheat berries, Water, 
Set the wheat berries in a sauce pan, cover with the water and soak  overnight. The following day boil the berries in the same water for 20  minutes, if you want them parboiled only (to cook later on in casseroles or  soups) or for 1 hour if you want them fully cooked.    Drain well and cool thoroughly. Transfer the cooked wheat berries to a  glass jar and store them in the refrigerator for 4 days. Store them in the  freezer only if you are going to use them in soups, stews or casseroles.  The freezer softens their texture and makes them less chewy.
