In a medium-large saucepan boil lentils in water for about 30 - 40 minutes  (or until thoroughly cooked). While these are cooking, chop onions and  tomatoes. In a very large skillet or pan, sautee onions until they are just  about cooked (mostly translucent). Add tomatoes and stir occasionally.  Crush the marjoram and savory in your palm and rub together to release the  flavor, and add to the pan. Add the salt. When it seems the tomatoes are  fairly stewy and cooked, add the cooked, well drained lentils (which by  this time should be done). Cook together for a few minutes to get an even  mixture.     To cook quinoa, boil two parts water to one part quinoa. Add grain  (supposedly youre supposed to rinse it, but I dont have a fine enough  colander, so I do without this step). Cover and lower to a simmer. Cook for  15 minutes. Stir and let sit covered off the heat for ten minutes before  serving.     This is a really good dish with steamed cauliflower and for a really neat  touch, try adding some cooked arame seaweed on top. Soak a handful of arame  in cold water (you dont need very much of this - a little goes a LONG way,  and its very very dense in nutrition). In a small pan heat some oil and  add a couple cloves of chopped or pressed garlic, and a very small amount  of diced ginger (optional). Add drained and squeezed arame and sautee for a  few minutes. Add soy sauce to taste. When the arame becomes crispy its  ready to eat. Just sprinkle on top of the stew, or any pasta dish for that  matter.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
