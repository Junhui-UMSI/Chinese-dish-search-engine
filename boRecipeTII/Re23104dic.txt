Juice of 1 large lemon, Orange juice, Heaping cup chopped onion, Pitted prunes, To 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, Sweet potatoes, Carrots, sliced, Matzoh meal, Salt, Tart apple, sliced, 
chop half the sweet potatoes into small chunks. combine with the other  ingredient except matzoh meal in a large casserole. grate other half of  sweet potatoes, combine with matzoh meal, and pat mix into place on top of  stuff in casserole. dot with cold margerine if desired (optional).    bake covered 1 hr. bake uncovered 1 hr. (mollie omits the temperature, but  its not that crucial. 350F is fine.)    cool and keep in fridge (covered) until ready to reheat for seder. add a  little more orange juice if it looks kinda dry. it should not be soupy.    serve with curry of choice and other sweet/spicy food. maybe an arugula  salad would be nice (always is).
