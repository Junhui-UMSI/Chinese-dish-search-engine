Yam Foofoo
Black pepper, Salt, Butter, Yams, 
Note:  Foofoo is a ubiquitous and much-beloved staple through most of West  Africa, whether topped with a fiery Palava sauce (or Shoko) or served as  the bland accompaniment to a main dish.  Foofoo is traditionally made with  cassava (aka yucca and/or manioc), but it can be prepared as well with  everything from rice, yams, and plantains to instant mashed potatoes! It is  also somewhat harder to make than it would seem. Ellen Wilson quotes a  traditional proverb that goes, "If a woman were like foofoo, a man could  get to know her before he married her."  What this has to do with foofoo  (or women) is anyones guess. In any case, this version of yam foofoo --  traditionally made by pounding and beating the yams in a mortar with a  wooden spoon -- has been adapted for a food processor.    1.  Place the yams in cold, unsalted water, bring to a full boil, and cook       25    minutes, or until soft.    2.  Remove the yams, cook, and peel.  Mash with the other ingredients.    3.  Place in a food processor, and run briefly to remove lumps.  DO NOT  PUREE!  (If a processor is not available, go directly to step 4.)    4.  Remove foofoo to a bowl, and beat with a wooden spoon or wire whisk  until smooth.  The foofoo should have a sticky, slightly resilient  consistency.    5.  Shape the foofoo into balls with your hands, and serve warm.    Recipe By     : Totally Hot!
