Pumpkin Pie Biscotti
Flour, Pumpkin pie spice, Eggs, Baking Powder, Macadamia nuts, Salt, Canned pumpkin, Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Butter, 
Combine first 5 ingredients in a large bowl; stir well. Combine pumpkin,  eggs and vanilla; stirring well with a wire whisk. Slowly add pumpkin  mixture to flour mixture, stirring until dry ingredients are moistened.  (Mixture will be very crumbly; it will gradually become moist after  stirring.)    Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add macadamia nuts. Cook,  stirring constantly, until nuts are browned. Remove from heat, and cool  completely. Knead or gently stir cooled nuts into dough.    *NOTE: I never use nuts in my biscotti in order to lower the fat content  and personally dont miss them at all. I will simply omit the nuts, thereby  also leaving out the butter. If you want to use the nuts, cut the amount of  nuts and butter in half.    Place dough on a lightly floured surface, and divide into 4 portions.  Lightly flour hands, and shape each portion into a 1" x 15" slightly  flattened log. Place logs 3" apart on lightly greased large cookie sheets.    Bake at 350=F8 for 23 minutes; cool logs 15 minutes. Reduce oven  temperature to 300=F8.    Cut each log crosswise into 1/2" slices, using a serrated knife. Place  slices on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 300=F8 for 15 minutes. Cool  completely on wire racks.    NOTES : This twice-baked cookie with staying power makes enough extras to  package and send as gifts.  Very good!!
