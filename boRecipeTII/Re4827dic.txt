Pick-A-Fruit Crumble
Margarine or butter,, Margarine or butter, cut up, Sliced, peeled plums,, Brown sugar (25 ml), Water (25 ml), Ground allspice (2 ml), Chopped nuts (25 ml), Honey (25 ml), Quick-cooking rolled oats, 
Many of these are from the Tupperware Tupperwave Stack-Cooked Meals  cookbooks. If you know of a Tupperware dealer, these are terrific cookbooks  ~- especially the basic, original cookbook. Wait to buy the Tupperwave  cookware until youre sure you want to. I use them all the time both  together and individually, but it took awhile. You can make the recipes  individually without them. BTW -- Im not a Tupperware dealer, nor am I  related to or friends with one. Just a satisfied customer. ;)    Arrange fruit in an even layer in a shallow dish. Combine honey and water;  pour over fruit. Dot with 2 tbsp. cut-up margarine. Cook uncovered on 100%  power (high) for 5 to 7 minutes or until fruit is tender.    Stir together oats, brown sugar and allspice; cut in 1 Tbsp. softened  margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in nuts. Sprinkle  topping over fruit before serving.
