Grind up in a food processor or blender.    Mix dried shrimps, bread crumbs and in a blender or processor container.  Process until the shrimps are ground up and well blended with crumbs. Empty  into a bowl, and add eggs, 1 at a time, until you have a batter the  consistency of a cooked oatmeal.    Heat enough oil in a skillet to about a depth of 1/4". Put a tablespoonful  of batter in the oil for each fritter, and fry til golden, turning once.    Serve on top of Nopales Guisados.
