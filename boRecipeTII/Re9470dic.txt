That way  we can enjoy a jack-o-lantern and use the pumpkin for baking. It shouldnt  spoil sitting out for a day.    After all the seeds are out of the pumpkin you can cook it by cutting it in  half and laying it flesh-side down on a baking sheet. Cook in a moderate  oven (about 325 degrees) for at least an hour. Check it frequently. When  the flesh is soft, scoop it away from the rind. Put it in a food processor  and pulse a few times to make it smooth. You can then use it in recipes or  freeze in bags for later use. I usually put about 2 cups in a bag.    When using fresh (or frozen) pumpkin remember that it is watery than canned  pumpkin. So cut down slightly on the liquids in most recipes.    Preheat oven to 350.  Combined flour, soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and  sugar in large mixing bowl. Add eggs, water, oil and pumpkin. Stir until  blended. Add nuts. Mix well. Pour into two loaf pans. Bake 1 hour. Cool  slightly and take out of pans to let cool on a rack. This tastes best if  you can wait a day to eat it. It keeps well in the refrigerator and can be  frozen.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
