Hanukkah Cookies
Shortening; (margarine OK), Sugar, Egg, Orange or pineapple juice, Baking Powder, Flour; plus extra for, 
1. In bowl, add ingreds in order stated, mixing well after each addition  (you can do it in a processor too).    2. Using half of dough at once, roll on floured board.    3. Cut into holiday shapes. [The set I inherited includes lion - of Judah  (Maccabee), dreidel, candel, star of david. Im sure similar cutters are  available in local Judaica or such shops, or by mailorder.]    4. Can decorate (lion eye, dreidel lines, candle tip, etc.) with chocolate  chip, raisin, sprinkles, colored sugar, etc.    5. Bake at 325o for 10 mins or so (I switch pans top-to-bottom and 180o  midway) till lightly browned. Harden a bit more as cool.    Freeze well, but they wont last that long. Makes about 6 doz, depending on  size of cookies.    NOTE: If making different shapes, try and make all of one shape on a tray  so that different sizes dont bake at different rates and then some will  burn and others will be raw.
