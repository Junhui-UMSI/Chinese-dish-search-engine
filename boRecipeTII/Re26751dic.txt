Grease and flour lightly a 9" square pan. Sift together the flour, sugar,  baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the shortening and milk. Beat  1 1/2 minutes with a mixer on low speed or 225 strokes by hand. Add in the  egg and vnailla and beat for another 1 1/2 minutes. Pour into pan and bake  at 350F for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into cake comes  out clean. Cool. Place cake on a cookie sheet and cut strips 2 inches wide  from each side of cake. Put ice cream on top of cake and completely cover  both with meringue. Seal meringue to edges. Bake at 450F for 5 minutes, or  until lightly browned. Serve at once.    MERINGUE TOPPING: Beat the egg whites and salt until they form soft peaks.  Still beating, slowly pour in the sugar and continue to beat for about 5  minutes, until the egg whites are stiff and glossy. Immediately spread over  cake and ice cream.
