Originally it was called zuppa del duca (the dukes soup) and was  created in honor of a visit by Grand Duke Cosimo deMedici III to Siena.  The Grand Duke took the recipe home to Florence, where it became popular in  the English intellectual and artistic colony by the end of the nineteenth  century. They, in turn, took it to England and the dish in now also known  in Italy as zuppa Inglese (English soup). Serves 4.    Put the egg, sugar and vanilla in a bowl and mix gently to a creamy  consistency.  Add the mascarpone and fold in to obtain a cream.  Put the  coffee in a bowl with the coffee liqueur.  Dip the biscuits for a second or  two in the coffee mixture, letting them absorb just enough to keep firm but  not fall apart.  Starting with the biscuits, arrange in four individual  dishes alternating layers of biscuits and mascarpone, ending with  mascarpone. Dust with cocoa powder and put into the fridge to set and  chill.    Enjoy and dont worry about the calories for the flavor is worth it.
