Hi! I hope everyone had a wonderful Pesach! This recipe is another favorite  of family and friends. Many years ago, I ordered a recipe box with cards  and separators and this recipe was in it. It is easy to make (worst part is  trimming the lamb) and makes a lot. The original recipe said it feeds ten  but I think thats overstating -- maybe 6 - 8. I hope you enjoy as much as  we do! Paula    Heat 1 T. oil in large skillet. saute half the lamb over very high heat  just until browned. Remove lamb to large bowl lined with paper towels.  Drain excess fat from pan. Repeat with more oil and rest of lamb. Lower  heat to medium. saute onions with cinnamon and pepper in 1 - 2 T. oil in  same skillet till onion is tender.    Lightly oil a 2 1/2 qt. casserole. Layer rice, raisins, meat, and onions.  Repeat layers. Sprinkle top with salt. Mix together consomm? and water and  pour over top. Cover. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 50 minutes. Remove cover.  Sprinkle with lemon juice and almonds. Bake 10 minutes longer uncovered.  Arrange parsley around outer edge of casserole before serving.    This dish can be prepared ahead up to the point of adding the consomm?.    NOTE: It is usually very difficult for me to find kosher consomm? and when  I do find it, it is chicken based. I use 10 1/2 oz. of water and three  teaspoons of bouillon powder (I use a brown vegetable one but I would think  that any type would be fine) and its delicious.
