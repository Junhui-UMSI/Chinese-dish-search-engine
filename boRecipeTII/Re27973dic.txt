EMERIL LIVE SHOW #EMIB08, DECADENT CHOCOLATE    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large saute pan, melt 4 tablespoons  of butter.    Add the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves and is bubbly. Add  the pecans.    Season the pecans with salt, cayenne, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Continue to  cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar starts to caramelize and coat  the pecans evenly. Cook for about 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat  and spread the pecans over a parchment lined baking sheet. Place the pan in  the oven and roast the pecans for about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the  oven and cool completely. Break the pecans into small pieces. Fill three  small saucepans half way up the pan with water. Place the pans over medium  heat and bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. In three separate  mixing bowls, add each type of chips into the individual bowls. Place the  bowls over the saucepans. After about 2 minutes over the heat the chocolate  will start to melt. Stir each chocolate until totally melted. Remove the  chocolate from heat and stir 1 tablespoon of butter into each bowl of  chocolate. Pour each type of chocolate over the marble or a large parchment  lined baking sheet. Sprinkle the pecans and cherries over the chocolates.  Using a metal spatula, spread the mixture out evenly back and forth to  about 1/4-inch thick. Either place the marble in the refrigerator or allow  to sit out until set, about a couple of hours. Break the bark into medium  pieces and serve. Yield: 4 pounds of bark    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 22, 1998
