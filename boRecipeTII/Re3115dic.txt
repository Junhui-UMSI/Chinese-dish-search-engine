Peanut Shrimp Chili
Cleaned shrimp, Minced cloves of garlic, Clam juice, Dried dill, Chili powder, Peanut butter, Peanut oil, Ground ginger, Dried Oregano, Water, Onion, chopped fine, Ground cumin, Tomato paste, Cooked white kidney beans, 
Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent; add the minced garlic and  cook, stirring all the while, for about a minute. Dont let the garlic  burn. Add cumin, dill, oregano, ginger and chili powder and cook, stirring  all the while, for about 2 minutes more.  Add the shrimp and then quickly  add the clam juice, water and tomato paste (I mix them together as part of  the prep, then add them to the pot). Quickly stir in the beans, season to  taste with salt and pepper (I use no salt and a "pepper melange" of green,  pink, white and black peppercorns). Increase the heat and, as soon as the  mixture starts to boil, remove from heat, whisk in the peanut butter,  adjust seasoning, and serve over rice.
