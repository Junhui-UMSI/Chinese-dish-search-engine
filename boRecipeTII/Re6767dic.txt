Mix together vermouth, cinnamon, honey, lime juice, garlic and salt  to form marinade.  Pour over disjointed chicken, turning pieces so  that they are well coated.  Let stand in the refrigerator for about 5  or 6 hours in the marinade.  Remove and bring to room temperature.  Broil chicken over charcoal basting with the marinade.  Broil about  40 minutes, not too close to the coals.  A little additional vermouth  can be added to marinade if it becomes too thick while cooking.    Serves 2 to 4.
