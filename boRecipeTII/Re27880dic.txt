*Recipe is included in this collection. PREPARATION:       Rinse rice 2 or  3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water chestnuts. Mix with  ground pork, soy      sauce and salt. COOKING: Bring stock and rice to a  boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3 hours or until     the rice breaks  down completely and the soup becomes       thick and creamy. Turn heat up  and add ground pork         mixture, shaping 1 t. at a time into a small  ball and      dropping it into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes or until pork  balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve in           individual soup  bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person to choose his favorite  toppings. Do ahead      notes: Make ahead and reheat slowly. COMMENTS: You  can     also use chicken slices, ground beef, fish filet or        ham  slices. A roast chicken or turkey carcass is excellent for making the  stock. Just cook the carcass, rice and water together. Take out the carcass  when the soup is done. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for  MM by Karen Adler FNGP13B.
