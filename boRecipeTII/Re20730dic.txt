In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in shortening until mixture  resembles coarse crumbs. Combine egg yolk and milk; add to flour mixture.  Stir just until dough clings together. Divide dough in half. On a lightly  floured surface, foll half of dough into a 15" X 10" rectangle; transfer to  a greased 15 X 10" baking pan. Set aside. In another bowl, toss together  the filling ingredients; spoon over pastry in pan. Roll out remaining dough  to another 15" X 10" rectangle. Place over filling. Brush with egg white.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire  rack. Combine the powdered sugar and enough water to achieve a drizzling  consistency. Drizzle over warm pastry. Cut into squares. Serve warm or  cold. Delicious! Serves: 20-26 servings, depending on size of cut squares.    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Geo & Donna <gstratio@computerpro.com> on  Mar 29, 1998
