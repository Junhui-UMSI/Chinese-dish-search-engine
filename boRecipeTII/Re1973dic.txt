Chocolate Pretzels
Butter, Sugar, Egg, Squares unsweetened, Flour, Cinnamon, Vanilla, Nuts; for sprinkling on top, 
source: The Settlement Cookbook    Cream butter and sugar. Add egg, melted chocolate, flour, cinnamon, and  vanilla. Chill. Roll small pieces of dough the thickness of a pencil. Shape  into pretzels. Place on a greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with nuts and bake  at 375 degrees.    Note: The recipe does not say if the nuts are ground or chopped. I would  guess ground, as it is in place of the salt on the pretzel. Also, the  baking time is not listed. I suppose that we get to guess.
