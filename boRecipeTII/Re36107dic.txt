Beef Satay
Soy sauce, Lime juice, Curry powder, Chili powder, Beef Sirloin, Honey, Garlic, Onion, 
Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl or plastic bag. In a  2-cup measure, combine the soy sauce, honey, lime juice, curry and chili  powders, onion and garlic. Blend thoroughly and pour over the meat.  Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature. Thread the meat on bamboo  skewers, soaked in water to prevent charring, or on small metal skewers.  Push the meat close together if some rare portions are wanted or space it  slightly for well done meat.  Grill 2 to 3 inches above hot coals until  done as desired, about 8 minutes total cooking time for medium-rare.
