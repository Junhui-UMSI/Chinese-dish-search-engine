Zucchini-Tomato Pie
Dijon mustard, Mozzarella cheese, Garlic, Salt and pepper, Zucchini, Oregano, pie shell, Fresh basil, Tomato, olive oil, 
The following recipe is from a recipe that I saw in the NY Times Magazine a  number of years ago. Its great for using up the zucchini and tomato crop.    Preheat oven 400F. Spread mustard evenly over bottom of pie shell, then  cover bottom completely with mozzarella.. (The original recipe called for a  full pound of cheese, I find that its too much. Use however much you are in  the mood for). Beginning at the outer edge of the shell, make a layered  overlapping row of the tomato and zucchini slices, alternating for color.  Make a second row, then use enough of the remaining slices to fill the  center. Sprinkle the top evenly with garlic and oregano. Season to taste  with salt and pepper. Drizzle oil over all, and top with chopped basil (I  use more than 2 tbls) Put on a baking sheet (line it with foil for easy  clean up if you use a lot of cheese) and bake about 40 minutes.    Note: serve warm or cold. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #225 by "Judy  Chavel-Hochsztein" <jchavelh@notes.cc.bellcore.com> on Aug 4, 1997
