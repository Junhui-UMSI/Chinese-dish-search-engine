Chop sausage coarsely. In skillet, fry sausage,  stirring until cooked through and starting to brown. Using a slotted spoon,  lift sausage from skillet, leaving drippings. Drain raisins and add to corn  bread mixture, along with sausage, stock to moisten, poultry seasoning and  pepper. Mix well. Spoon into a greased 2 1/2 quart casserole or use to  stuff turkey. If baking separately, bake, uncovered, in 325 degrees oven  for 1 hour. Makes about 2 quarts. Note: Use about 3/4 cup of stuffing per  pound of turkey and stuff turkey just before roasting.
