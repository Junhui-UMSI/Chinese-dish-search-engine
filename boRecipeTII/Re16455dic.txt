(CREMPOG CYMRU (FFROIS CYMRU)) Sift the flour and salt together. Make a  hole in the centre of the flour and add the egg. Add 2 table- spoonsful of  liquid and stir until all the ingredients are mixed well together and there  are no lumps. Add half the remaining liquid and beat until the batter is  smooth. Stir in the rest of the liquid. Heat a little lard in a frying pan  until it begins to haze. Pour just enough batter into the pan to cover  the bottom. Fry, using a moderate heat, shaking the pan gently so that the  pancake does not stick to the pan. Turn and cook the other side. Turn on to  a plate and sprinkle witil sugar. Roll up and place under a low grill to  keep warm.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #263 by "ray.watson"  <ray.watson@ukonline.co.uk> on Wed, 25 Sep 1996.
