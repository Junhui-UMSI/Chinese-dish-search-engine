Heat oil in heavy pan.  Add onions and fry until golden brown. Add garlic,  ginger and all spices except salt. Fry for 5 minutes until fragrant. If  mixture is too dry add a little water.  Stir regularly to prevent burning.  Add lamb and toss through to coat with onion/spices. Fry further 10  minutes, stirring to prevent burning/sticking. Add thawed spinach and mix  thoroughly.  Add coconut cream and salt.  Stir well. Add curry leaves,  bring to a rapid boil.  Reduce heat and allow to simmer for at least 1.5  hours covered. Remove lid and simmer till sauce reduces, usually 15-30  minutes.  This is an exceptionally hot curry, if you prefer a milder curry  reduce by half the following ingredients: chilli powder and hot paprika.    This recipe also lends itself to substituting chicken for the lamb. WALT    Philippa Jane Wightman P.O. Box 270, The Gap Q Australia
