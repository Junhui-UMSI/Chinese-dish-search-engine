Armadillo Eggs
Bisquick mix, pork sausage, Monterey Jack Cheese, Egg, jalapeno peppers, cheddar cheese, 
*Jimmy Dean Sausage brand is best **Use 20-30 peppers-may use fresh, but  success reported when using bottled or canned. Slice peppers in half  lengthwise & scrape out all the seeds (wear gloves). Try to keep both  halves near each other as you have to put them back together later. Mix  bisquick, raw sausage & cheddar cheese. Stuff each pepper with Monterey  Jack cheese & put the halves back together. Grab a handful of bisquick  mixture & mold around pepper in shape of elongated egg. Use enough to cover  pepper wiell. Dip armadillo egg in beaten egg & roll in Shake n Bake. Bake  on broiler pan (can use cookie sheet) at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or  until crisp. ]]]]]    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Gail Beynon <Beynong@AOL.COM> on Aug 30, 1997
