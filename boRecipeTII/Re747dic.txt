Peel and roast the garlic. Cool. Puree the garlic and add to cream. Place  in a sauce pan and reduce to 2/3 volume over low to medium heat. Remove  from heat and allow to cool.    Peel and thin slice the potatoes. Layer the potatoes evenly in a greased  baking pan. Sprinkle salt, pepper and garlic cream between each layer. Wrap  with foil. Bake at 350 for 1.5 hours. About every 15-20 minutes press the  top of the potatoes with a flat spatula. This is done to compact the  potatoes. When the potatoes are done, remove the foil. Continue to bake for  another 15-20 minutes. Remove them from the oven when the top has browned.  Keep in a warm place but allow to slightly cool before cutting.    Service: Re-heat the remaining sauce. Cut the potatoes into 4-6 servings.  Pour 1-2 oz of the sauce over each serving. Garnish with chopped fresh  chives or parsley.    >From the Grouse Mountain Grill    Dining in Vail, Colorado from VailNet the Official Web Site of the Vail  Valley Copyright 1996, InterNetWorks    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 21, 98
