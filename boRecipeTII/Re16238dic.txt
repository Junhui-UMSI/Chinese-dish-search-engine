Watercress Emulsion
Pepper (Freshly Ground); To, Coarse salt, Canola oil, Coarse salt, Watercress, 
Wash watercress and remove the thickest stems. Bring medium pot of water to  a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt. Have a medium bowl of ice water at hand  for refreshing. When water returns to the boil, plunge watercress in and  cook for 30 seconds. Drain watercress and quickly drop in ice water. When  thoroughly chilled, drain watercress again and lightly squeeze out water.  Chop blanched watercress roughly on cutting board. Place in blender and  puree, adding a little water if necessary to get the mixture going. With  blender running, gradually pour in oil until emulsion is formed. Add rest  of salt and pepper, puree again and taste, adjusting seasoning if needed.  Serve over poached salmon. Yield: 4 servings Poaching is a delicious way to  prepare fish without adding fat. Great for dinner parties: because the  cooking is gentle, it allows a wide margin of error, fish wont overcook  too quickly. Properly poached fish has a wonderful silky texture.  Courtbouillon means quickboiling in French; it doesnt need to cook for  long (compared to a stock). Can use this courtbouillon to poach any fish as  well as shrimp, squid, etc. A courtbouillon should be fullflavored and  wellseasoned, with a good dose of acidity to firm up the protein in the  fish. No need to season fish fillets with salt and pepper as seasoning is  already in the liquid. Watercress emulsion can be done with any other herb.  The oil is suspended, or emulsified into the watercress puree to form a  thick creamy sauce. Could strain this to get a watercress oil. Watercress  one of our favorite greens, found everywhere in Mexico. Less expensive than  other bitter greens, widely available most of the year.
