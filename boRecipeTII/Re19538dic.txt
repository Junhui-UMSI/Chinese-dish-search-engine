Anise Cookies " Anesplatzchen"
Anise extract, Plus 2 Tbs. sugar, Baking Powder, Salt, Flour, Eggs, room temperature, 
Beat eggs until fluffy in mixer bowl at medium speed. gradually beat in  sugar. Continue beating 20 minutes more ( a must ). At low speed blend in  flour, baking powder and salt. Add anise extract and beat only to blend.  Drop by teaspoonful on greased and floured baking sheets about 1/2 inch  apart. Swirl each to make a circular form. You can bake these two ways.  Either let stand on baking sheets for 8 hours at room temperature ( to dry  out ) or bake immediately. Either way bake at 325 degrees about 10 minutes  or until firm looking or set. cool on rack and store airtight. If made the  first way to dry out these are a coffee dunker cookie or if baked  immediately they are much softer and delicate.Either way they are  delicious. I bake mine the second way.
