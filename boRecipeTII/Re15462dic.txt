(From "Rosies Bakery All Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar-Packed,  No-Holds-Barred Baking Book" by Judy Rosenberg. Workman. $12.95)    Preheat oven to 325F. Lightly grease an 11x7" baking pan with butter  or vegetable oil.    Melt the butter in the top of a double boiler placed over simmering  water. When the butter has melted, add the chocolate and melt.    Using a mixer on medium-high speed, beat the eggs and salt in a  medium-size mixing bowl until frothy, about 30 seconds. Gradually add  the sugar and continue beating until the eggs are thick and pale,  about 1-1/2 minutes. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula.    Add the chocolate mixture and the vanilla and mix on medium-low speed  until blended, about 5 seconds. Scrape the bowl.    Mix in the flour on low speed until blended, scraping the bowl with  the rubber spatula once during blending. Pour the batter evenly into  the prepared pan.    Bake the brownies on the center oven rack until a tester inserted in  the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Allow the brownies to  cool on a rack for 1 hour before cutting.    Makes 12 brownies.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/tn-94q3.zip
