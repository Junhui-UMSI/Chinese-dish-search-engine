Select cucumbers which are 7 to 8 inches long, but as small around as you  can get. Peel the cucumbers and then slice each across into four equal  pieces. Using a small spoon scoop out the seeds being careful to leave a  "bottom" in each piece. Preparing the meat stuffing: Combine the ground  pork, garlic, ginger, Cilantro, 4 of the green onions, and fish sauce. Make  a small ball of the mixture and microwave for about a minute to cook  thoroughly.  Taste for seasoning, and correct if needed. Using your fingers  stuff the meat mixture into the cucumbers (stick a toothpick through the  side of the cucumber and into the meat to hold it in place while it cooks),  and place in the hot stock. Cook about 15 minutes and add the 4 remaining  green onions cut in 2" lengths, the two carrots cut into matchsticks and  the canned quail eggs.  Cook another 5 minutes and serve immediately. Note:  If you can manage to keep the soup just barely below the boil your finished  soup will be very clear.  If that doesnt work out dont worry.....it will  taste just as good!
