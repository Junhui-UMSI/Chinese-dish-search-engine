The Dolls Baked Potato Soup
Coarsely, Or less, Onion -- chopped fine, Butter or olive oil or comb, Baked potatoes -- chopped, Milk -- any, Chicken Stock, 
Saute onion in butter or olive oil.  Put onion and potatoes in food  processor or blender. Add chicken stock. Pulse on and off. Add milk and  process until desired smoothness. I like it slightly lumpy myself. You  might find it easier to blend ingredients while cool and then reheat.  Suggested garnishes:  chopped green or red onion, bacon bits, grated  cheeses (cheddar, roquefort, or queso anejo), red pepper flakes, tabasco,  sour cream, virtually anything your heart desires.
