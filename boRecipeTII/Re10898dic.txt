Heat the peanut oil in a skillet and dust the rabbit with flour. Brown  the rabbit over high heat quickly then pour off the oil and fats that  accumulate.         Add onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, flour, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and  tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes.         Add the wine and bring the mixture to a boil.         Preheat your oven to 350 F.         Bake the rabbit in your oven for 45 minutes.         Remove the rabbit and thicken the sauce with the beurre manie (you  know that fancy chefs have to have fancy names ... this is a "roux".) For  the beurre manie, simply melt the butter in a saute pan, add the flour and  then cook over medium heat for a minute or two to take the "floury" flavor  out of the mix.         Pour the sauce over the rabbit and serve.
