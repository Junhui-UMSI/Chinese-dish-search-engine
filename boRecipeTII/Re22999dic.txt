Trout Baked in Wine
White wine, Rainbow trout, herbs, 
*Whichever ones you like parsley, thyme, herbes de provence....& Garlic.    Scale and gut the trout if not cleaned already.  You can filet it, or  not: it hardly matters.  Cut the trout in half the long way and lay in a  baking dish.  Barely cover with white wine.  Add herbs, if you like  them, or garlic.  Bake at 350 F for half an hour.
