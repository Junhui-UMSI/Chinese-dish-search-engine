Arook Thayin (Chicken Croquettes Burmese Style)
Fresh green chilies, seeded, Light vegetable oil for, Scallions, very finely, Flour, The Juice of 1-1/2 inch, Chicken-breast fillets, Eggs, Salt, Chopped coriander leaves, 
Chop the scallions, chilies (half a chili is enough for me), and coriander  in the food processor. Then add the chicken, flour, eggs, ginger, and salt,  and process until the chicken is finely chopped and all the ingredients are  well blended. (I have overprocessed the chicken to a paste by mistake, and  the result was also delightful). Chill, covered, for 1-2 hours.    Deep-fry by the heaping tablespoon (dip the spoon in oil so that the  mixture does not stick) in medium-hot oil, turning over once, until browned  all over. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot or cold.    The recipe makes about fourteen 2 1/2-inch (6-cm) fritters and up to  thirty-six tiny ones.    VARIATION:    An Indian Baghdadi arook thayin is made with a pinch of turmeric.    SERGIOS NOTES:    Jews from Calcutta, Cochin, Persia, and Iraq began to settle in Burma, in  Southeast Asia, in the mid-nineteenth century. It was Jews of Baghdadi  origin who organized the congregation, and it is their style of cooking  that influenced the Jewish style that developed locally. During the  Japanese occupation, almost all the community fled, many of them to India.    This recipe was given to someone I know by Mrs. Philomene Jacobs of the  Baghdadi community in India. These delectable fritters - soft and creamy,  gingery and peppery - make splendid finger food. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD  digest V97 #204 by Linda Shapiro <lss@coconet.com> on Jun 28, 1997
