Balsamic Chicken and Penne Pasta
Sugar, Boneless chicken breasts, Penne pasta, cayenne pepper, Balsamic vinegar, Water, Garlic, Grey Poupon mustard, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 
Combine the first seven ingredients to make the marinade (mix them well).  Marinate the chicken breasts for 1 - 2 hours (marinate longer if you want  the chicken to be more flavorful).    Broil chicken breast until cooked through, then shred or cut into  bite-sized pieces. Combine cooked chicken with leftover marinade and cooked  penne. Heat everything through thoroughly (the remaining marinade must be  cooked because there was raw chicken sitting in it). Serve with grated  Parmesan cheese.
