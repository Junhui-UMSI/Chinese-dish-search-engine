Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.    Meanwhile:    Heat large skillet add oil, beef and garlic.  Saute until until no longer  pink and drain fat.    Add remaining ingredients except the grated mozarella or swiss cheese.  Simmer the mixture until the past is cooked just barely tender. Drain the  pasta and mix it with the sauce. Pour all into a 3-quart Anchor Hocking (of  course LOL!) glass rectangular baking dish and top with the remaining  cheese.    Bake uncovered at 350 for 25 minutes or until bubbly and hot.
