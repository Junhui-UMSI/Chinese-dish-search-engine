Feeds 4 starving college students    Saute onions, garlic and peppers until onions are soft. Add potatoes and  spices. Cook covered, stirring frequently (otherwise they stick pretty  bad). When the potatoes are tender, throw on pepper, throw in a bowl and go  to.    I always eat this with Moosewood Cooks at Homes mango salsa. Ive included  the recipe below. This combination is divine!! Spicy and sweet mixed  together. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #047 by Lyonne@aol.com on Apr 5,  1997
