Randy Pollaks Persimmon Pudding
Salt, Raisins, Baking soda, Whipped egg white, Whipped cream, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Butter, Egg yolk, - 2T rum or brandy, Cinnamon, Sugar, Egg, Powdered sugar, Persimmon pulp, Flour, Pecans, milk, SAUCE, 
Mix the persimmon puree and the baking soda together and let it stand.  Cream together the sugar and butter, then add the egg, milk, vanilla,  (rum), and persimmon mixture. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix.    Pour into well-buttered pudding mold or tin can (i.e., a coffee can). Fill  them only 2/3 full. Place the mold on a trivet in a pan over a few inches  of boiling water. (I use one of those folding steamer baskets). Cover the  pan and steam over low heat for 2 hours. You will need to add more boiling  water as it evaporates. When a skewer tests clean, it is done.    Let stand in the mold uncovered for about 15 minutes. Turn onto a plate and  let cool, or serve warm with hard sauce or whipped cream. Beat the egg yolk  with powdered sugar and rum or brandy. Fold in whipped egg white and  whipped cream.
