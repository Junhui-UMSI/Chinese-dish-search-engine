CRUST: If you are prebaking the shell, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Place the crumbs in a mixing bowl and add the butter and sugar blending  well. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and up the sides of an 8-inch  springform pan. Smooth the mixture to form an even layer on the bottom and  sides. Bake the crust in the oven for 10 minutes and let cool to room  temperature before filling.    NOTE: This crust can be chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until it  is set but is not recommended in this recipe.    CHEESECAKE: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, beat  the cream cheese and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, one  at a time, beating well after each. Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon  juice, and vanilla until just mixed. Whip the cream until stiff in a medium  mixing bowl. Set aside. In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until  they form stiff peaks, then fold them into the cheese mixture. Fold in the  reserved whipped cream. Stir in the passion fruit pulp then pour the  mixture into the prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool, in  the oven, to room temperature, then chill.
