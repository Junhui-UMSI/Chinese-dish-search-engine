These came out of the Jan/Feb 96 Chile Pepper Magazine written by Barb &  Ron Kroll. I cant say that Ive tried any of them. Hope they help.    Grind the garlic and the chiles in a mortar or food processor to form a  paste.  Combine the cilantro and tomatoes with the chile paste.  Mix in the  oil, cumin and salt and let sit for an hour to blend the flavors.
