Teff Bread
Bread Flour, Vegetable oil, Dry yeast, Teff grains, Malt, Salt, Water, 
Teff is a very tasty grain used for thousands of years in Ethiopia. It is  easily the tiniest grain I have ever seen and adds a delicious character to  bread.    *NOTE (if both are available, try using some flour and some whole grain.  The total amount should still be 3/4 cup.)    When set on a 13-hour cycle, the center collapses and makes a very dense  loaf.    Variation:      2-1/4    cup flour 1/4 cup poppy seed } excellent loft      1/4    cup bran      1/4    cup millet    From the sheet put out by Narsai David.
