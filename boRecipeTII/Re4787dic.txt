Picadillo Filling for Tacos a la the Border Cookbook
Baking potato, Beef stock, Salt, Corn tortillas, Hot sauce, Vegetable oil, Chuck roast, All-purpose flour, Dried oregano, Onion, Shredded lettuce, Cayenne, Vegetable oil, Garlic, 
In a heavy skillet, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic  and saute for a couple of minutes until softened. Add the meat and fry  until it is gray. Stir in the flour, oregano, and chile. Then add the  potato, stock, and salt and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the mixture for  another 5 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and most of the liquid  has thickened but the picadillo remains moist.    Heat at least 1 inch of oil in another skillet until the oil ripples. With  tongs, dunk a tortilla in the oil long enough for it to go limp, a matter  of seconds. Dont let the tortilla turn crisp. Repeat with the remaining  tortillas and drain them.    Fill a tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of picadillo, fold in half, and  secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and picadillo.    Raise the temperature of the oil to 350 degrees. Fry the taco, in batches,  until lightly browned and crisp. Drain well. Remove the toothpicks and  garnish with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. Serve the tacos immediately  accompanied with hot sauce and sour cream.
