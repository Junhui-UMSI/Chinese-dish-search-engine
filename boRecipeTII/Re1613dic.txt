The Cook & Kitchen Staff are offering you four different Thanksgiving Day  Dinner menus during November, and were now in the middle of our third  recipe collection, featuring our "Metropolitan Thanksgiving Day Dinner"  fare.    Todays recipe makes the most of your oven space because its prepared  entirely on the stove-top.    The Kitchen Staff recommends you use a very tart apple to complement the  natural sweetness of the potatoes. The Granny Smith apple is the perfect  fruit to use in todays recipe as it holds its shape well while cooking.    Peel and slice fresh sweet potatoes. In a large saucepan, cover the  potatoes with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to  medium and simmer, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until potatoes are  almost tender. Drain.    Or forgo the first step and use canned sweet potatoes.    Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine the apple slices, brown sugar, apple  juice, butter, allspice, and nutmeg. Bring the mixture to a boil over a  moderate heat setting. Reduce the heat slightly and cook, uncovered, for 3  to 5 minutes or until apples are almost tender and the juice mixture is  slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Gently stir in the sweet  potatoes.    Cook, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until apples are tender and  sweet potatoes are heated through, spooning the juice mixture over potatoes  occasionally. Remove mixture to a serving dish and present warm.    Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by Recipe-a-Day  <recipe-a-day@bignetwork.com> on Nov 14, 1998, converted by MM_Buster  v2.0l.
