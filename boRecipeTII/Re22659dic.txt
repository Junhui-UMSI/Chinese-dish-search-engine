Use this recipe with peaches, sour cherries or pineapple with equally good  results.    CAKE BATTER: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Butter a 10-inch round, 2-inch deep  cake pan and line the bottom with a disk of parchment or wax paper. In a  large mixer bowl, beat the butter and sugar until soft and light. Add the  egg and continue beating until light. Add the yolks one at a time, beating  well between each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Sift together the flour  and baking powder and stir into the batter. Spread the batter evenly in the  prepared pan. Rinse and halve the apricots. Remove the pits with the bowl  of a small spoon if they resist. Arrange the apricot halves cut-side up on  the batter in concentric rows, overlapping slightly, leaving a margin of  about 1-inch around the edge. Dont be concerned if the apricots mound  slightly in the center of the cake; the top will even out as the cake  bakes.    CRUMB TOPPING: FOR THE CRUMBS, mix the flour, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.  Melt the butter and stir it in evenly. Rub the mixture to coarse crumbs by  hand. Scatter the crumbs over the apricots and the edge of the batter as  evenly as possible. Bake the cake 1 hour until a knife inserted in the  center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for about 15 minutes and  invert a plate on it. Invert onto the plate and lift off the pan. Peel off  the paper and invert a rack on the cake. Invert cake onto the rack, remove  the plate and cool.
