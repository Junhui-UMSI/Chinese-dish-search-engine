The First Wasp Latkes
salt and pepper, olive oil, Russet potatoes, Russet potatoes, Unsalted butter, 
Grate the potatoes onto a large clean kitchen towel that can be stained.  Roll the potatoes up in the towel and wring to remove moisture. (It is best  to do this over the sink, since it will produce a suprising amount of  liquid). Melt the butter with the olive oil on a large griddle. Form the  grated potatoes into 4 pancakes. Cook the pancakes over medium heat for  about 10 minutes, until bottom is golden brown, then flip the pancakes.  Cook on the other side for about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and  serve plain or with sour cream and applesauce.
