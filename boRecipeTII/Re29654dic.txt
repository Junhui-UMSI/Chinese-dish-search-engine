Tastykake Peanut Butter Kandy Kakes
Hershey Milk-chocolate chips, Water, Egg whites, golden pound Cake mix, Peanut butter, Powdered sugar, 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Beat the egg whites until fluffy.  Blend the egg whites with the cake mix and water. Pour  tablespoon-size dollops of batter into each cup of a well-greased  muffin tin. Bake for 10 minutes, or until a toothpick stuck in center  of cake comes out clean. Make five batches.  Clean muffin tin for  later use. Do not grease. Combine the peanut butter and sugar.  While  the pound-cake rounds cool, heat the chocolate chips in a double  boiler over low heat, stirring often. You can also melt them in a  microwave oven set on high for 2 minutes, stirring once halfway  through the heating time. When the chocolate is soft, line the bottom  half of each muffin-tin cup with shortening; then use a spoon to  spread a thin layer of chocolate in each cup. With your fingers,  spread a thin layer of peanut butter over the chocolate. Place a cake  round on the peanut-butter layer. Spread a layer of choloate over the  top of each cake, spreading to the sides to cover the entire surface.  Cool in the refrigerator for 10 minutes and turn out of the tin.
