Place ingrediants in bread pan in the order recommended by the  manufacturer.  Dont use the delayed timer cycle since the cheese may  spoil.  Bake on light crust.    NOTE:  Due the differing moisture content of cheese, you may need to watch  the dough ball to determine if it is too moist or too dry.
