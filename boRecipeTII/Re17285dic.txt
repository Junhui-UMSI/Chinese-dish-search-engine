Wakame Onion Mushroom Soup
See instructions, 
Reggie was asking for recipes for Asian soups. This is from an excellent  cookbook I use when looking for really light recipes based on the Eat More,  Weigh Less(tm) diet. Im not sure how easy it is to find this book, so  heres the ISBN in case youd like to order it: ISBN:0-9636117-1-2.    Source: Eat More, Weigh Less Cookbook by Terry Shintani pg. 179 - 1995  edition    Soak wakame and mushrooms in 1 cup of water until soft and cut into 1"  pieces.    Saute onions in 1/4 cup of water. Add water from the soaked wakame and  mushrooms and the rest of the water. Bring to a boil, add the wakame and  mushrooms and cook over low flame until it is tender.    Add miso to taste by diluting 1 to 2 TB of miso in a ladle full of the soup  water, mashing and smoothing out the miso and adding it back to the pot.  Leftover grain or noodles may be added if desired. Add other vegetables if  desired. Makes 6 portions.    1 portion: Cal 23, Fat .3, Protein 16%, Carbo 73%, Fat 12%.
