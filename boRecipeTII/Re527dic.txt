adapted from "Hollyhocks and Radishes - cookbook from Michigans Upper  Peninsula    Notes: This recipe takes about 15 minutes to start to finish (if  ingredients are on hand). Recipe calls for fresh fruit; I use fresh/frozen  depnding on availability. Original recipe also called for 4 oz cream  cheese, and whipped topping, where I use tofu cream.    1) In sauce pan, toss 2 cups blueberries with sugar/corn starch.    2) Add water; bring to boil and cook slowly till thickened, stirring  constantly (takes about 2 - 5 minutes).    3) Take off heat, stir in lemon juice and set aside to cool.    Meanwhile/Then,    4) line bottom of 9-inch dish with graham crackers,    5) spread with tofu cream (orig cream cheese)    6) stir 1-1/2 cups blueberries into cooked mixture (Note; if using frozen  berries, do this with step 3)    7) pour onto prepared pie crust/on top of graham crackers    8) top with remaining 1/2 cup blueberries and raspberries    9) serve with addl tofu cream (orig. whipped topping).    Chill, and serve to people of all diets - this is guaranteed to be enjoyed  by beef-eaters and others.
