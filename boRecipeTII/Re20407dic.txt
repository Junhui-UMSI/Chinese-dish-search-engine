Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan, bring potato, carrot,  onion, 1 cup water and salt to a boil over medium high heat. Lower heat to  medium, cover and simmer until potato and carrot are tender, about 10  minutes. Meanwhile, thaw frozen broccoli in a colander under hot running  water, then set aside and drain well.    When potato mixture has finished simmering, pour into a blender and add  tofu, yeast, lemon juice and garlic. Blend until very smooth and creamy.  Pour into a shallow, greased 1 1/2- to 2-quart casserole. Add broccoli,  rice, mushrooms and 3/4 cup water. Stir well and smooth top of casserole.  Bake for 40 minutes, until golden and bubbling. Serves 4.    Substitution: Instead of frozen broccoli, you can use 1 pound fresh  broccoli (tops only), chopped and steamed briefly until crisp-tender, then  cooled under cold-running water and drained thoroughly.
