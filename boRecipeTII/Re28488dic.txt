To prepare duck and remove the skin intact, turn the duck with its back up.  Make an incision down the back and gently pull the skin away down to the  breast on each side. Cut the skin off the wing at the first joint and do  the same at the leg. Pull the skin inside out at the leg and wing,  liberating as much as possible with a small sharp knife. When skin is  removed, sprinkle it with a little of the cognac and reserve. Remove all  meat from duck, reserving liver. Grind meat with other meats, seasonings,  egg, and cognac.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rest overnight. Sprinkle  duck liver with cognac and reserve as well. The next day, saute a sample of  the meat and correct seasonings. Line a 1-1/2 quart terrine mold, with  cover, with the duck skin. Place a layer of half the meat in the bottom.  Lay the liver on top.  Fill terrine with remaining meat. Place bay leaves  on top and fold the skin over to cover. Seal with 2 layers of foil. Place  in a bain-marie, filled 2/3 of the way to the top of terrine with boiling  water. Bake in 325 oven for 1-1/2 hours or until a metal skewer inserted in  the center for one minute is burning hot when touched to the skin. Pour off  accumulated fat, weight with a brick, and refrigerate overnight or for  several days. Prepare Marinated Mushrooms. (SEE RECIPE) To unmold, dip the  mold in hot water and invert.  Slice and serve garnished with cornichons,  vegetables, and Marinated Mushrooms.  Serve with a crock of good mustard &  crusty bread. Time includes refrigeration.
