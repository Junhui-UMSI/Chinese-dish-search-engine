Tiropetes - Cheese Puffs
Feta cheese, Chopped parsley, Butter, Eggs, Nutmeg, Grated Romano cheese, Cream cheese, Large curd cottage cheese, Strudel leaves, 
Combine all ingredients except strudel leaves & butter, until thoroughly  mixed. Mixture will be slightly lumpy. Melt butter. Carefully cut leaves  into 3 equal portions lengthwise. Refrigerate 2/3 of the leaves until  needed; cover remaining third with damp towel. Remove one set of leaves &  place on flat surface & butter well. Fold long sides toward middle, making  strip about 2-inches wide. Butter this strip. Place 1 tablespoon of cheese  mixture in bottom right hand corner of strip; fold over into triangle  shape; continue folding, making sure with each fold that bottom edge is  parallel with the alternate edge. Bake in 425 oven until golden brown.  Serve warm. Yield depends on making small triangles; if done correctly,  this should give about 100 pieces.    MRS TERRANCE L.
