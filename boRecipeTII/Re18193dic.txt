Preheat the fryer.    In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the  onions and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the vegetables start to wilt.  Season with salt and cayenne. Stir in the venison, chili powder, cumin,  crushed red pepper, and oregano. Brown the meat for 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in  the garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, and 2 1/2 cups beef stock. Bring the  liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the liquid, uncovered  for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, or until the venison is tender. Skim off  the fat occasionally. Mix the masa and remaining stock together. Slowly  stir in the masa slurry and continue to cook for 30 minutes. Reseason with  salt and cayenne.    Fry the shoestring potatoes in batches until golden-brown, about 3 to 4  minutes. Remove the shoestrings from the oil and drain on a paper-lined  plate. Season the fries with salt and pepper. Cover the bottom of a large,  glass rectangular pan with the shoestrings. Sprinkle 3 cups of the two  cheeses over the fries. Place the fries in the oven and cook for 3 to 4  minutes, just until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the oven and  spoon the chili over the top of the fries. Garnish with the remaining  cheese, sour cream and jalapenos.    This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
