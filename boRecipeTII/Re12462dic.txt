Pour over them three-quarters of  a bottle of white wine and let them cook until they have opened. Drain  them, setting aside the liquid in which they have cooked, and remove the  empty half-shells. -- Chop the white part of a leek with a small onion, add  a clove of garlic, and saute this mixture in a saucepan with good oil, add  the liquid from the clams, and a quart of fish stock; add a peeled and  chopped tomato, a bouquet of marjoram, and a few green leaves of celery.  Let this bubble fast for ten minutes, remove the bouquet and the garlic,  stir the clams into the soup, and pour it into the tureen. Serve separately  small croutons of bread fried in oil."
