1. Break the eggs into a medium bowl and whisk together. Slowly add the  milk and whisk again. Add the chillies, coriander, cheese, salt and pepper.    2. Cut the bread slices in half diagonally, soak them, one at a time, in  the egg mixture.    3. Heat the oil in a medium frying pan (skillet) and fry the bread slices  over a medium heat, turning them once or twice, until they are golden  brown.    4. Drain off any excess oil as you remove the toasts from the pan and serve  immediately.    These crunchy toasts make an ideal snack or part of brunch and go really  well with grilled tomatoes and baken beans.    Compiled by Imran C.  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #183    From: "I.
