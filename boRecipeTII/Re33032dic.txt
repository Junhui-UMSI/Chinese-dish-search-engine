In a 5x9x2-1/2-inch loaf pan, combine all ingredients; mix well.  Seal pan  snuggly with aluminum foil.  Bake at 350F until rice is tender, about 1  hour, 10 minutes.  Serve immediately.  However, you can count on the rice  staying hot for 45 minutes and warm for 2 hours.  To reheat leftover rice,  either use a double boiler or warm the rice in a skillet with unsalted  butter.
