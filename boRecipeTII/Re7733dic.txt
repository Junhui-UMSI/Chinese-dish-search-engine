Port Braised Duck
Steak sauce, Onion, Curry powder, Ribs celery; chopped, Water, Port wine, Ducks, Salt and lemon pepper, 
With the Arkansas duck season scheduled to end tomorrow afternoon at  sunset and in Mississippi and Tennessee at sunset Jan. 18, many gumbooters  probably have a supply of fat mallards in the freezer. Thaw out two large  ducks or four smaller ones and try this recipe.     Cut ducks in half with poultry shears. Oil a large roasting pan and  sprinkle the onion and celery on the bottom. Place the ducks, breast side  down, on the onion and celery mixture. Mix the port wine, water, steak  sauce, curry powder, salt and lemon pepper and pour over the ducks. Cover  and place in a preheated 450-degree oven for 20 minutes. Turn heat down and  cook for another 90 minutes at 350 degrees. Check the water level once or  twice and add more if necessary. Serve the ducks with the pan juices ladled  over a mound of long grain and wild rice mixture. Serves four.
