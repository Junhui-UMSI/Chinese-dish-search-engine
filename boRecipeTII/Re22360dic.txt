Put water and pectin into a very heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Stir in baking  soda.  The soda will cause foaming.  Do not be alarmed.    Put golden syrup and sugar into another pan.  Put both pans on high heat.  Stir alternately 3 to 5 minutes or until foaming has ceased in the pectin  pot and boiling is active in the other. Then, still stirring the syrup  mixture, gradually and steadily pour the pectin mixture into it. Continue  stirring and boiling, and add jelly during the next minute. Remove the  mixture from heat and stir in lemon juice, lemon rind and nuts.    Pour into 8 x 8 inch pan. Let stand at room temp about 3 hours. When  mixture is very firm, sprinkle with confectioners sugar.    Cut into shapes or squares by pressing down with a buttered or sugared  knife. Release the candies onto a sugared tray so all sides become coated.  If you plan packing these candies, let them stand sugared 12 hours or more  on a rack. Redust on all sides and pack, then store tightly covered. Should  you want to dip them in chocolate, remove excess sugar first.
