Powter Chocolate Mousse Bars
Unsweetened cocoa powder, Canola oil, Vanilla extract, Plain Nonfat Yogurt, Unsweetened Baking Chocolate, Unsweetened Applesauce, Sugar, Flour, Egg whites, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Spray 9 x 9" baking pan with oil and wipe off  excess, or use nonstick pan. Sift together flour and cocoa powder. Set  aside. Melt chocolate in double boiler. When melted, turn off heat and add  oil. Mix until combined. Cool slightly.    Beat egg whites on high with sugar until very fluffy. Add applesauce,  yogurt, vanilla extract, melted chocolate, and dry ingredients. Lower speed  and continue beating until well incorporated. Pour mixture into baking pan  and bake for 20-25 minutes. The center of the mixture will feel firm and  not liquidy when touched lightly. A toothpick inserted will come out  covered with batter, not clean. Cool and serve chilled.
