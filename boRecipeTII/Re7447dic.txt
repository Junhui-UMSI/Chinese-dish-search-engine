For the marinade:  In a skillet, combine onion and cider vinegar and simmer  until the onion is soft.  Add rosemary, sage, parsley, balsamic vinegar,  juice of 1/2 lemon, pink peppercorns and extra-virgin olive oil. Stir well,  remove from heat and set aside.    Preheat the oven to 375F.    Pat pork with paper towels and rub it all over with 1 Tbl of olive oil.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.    In a frying pan, heat 1 Tbl olive oil over medium high heat and brown the  meat on all sides.  Transfer the meat to a baking dish and add 1/3 cup dry  white wine to the dish. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until cooked to 155F  to 160F.  Midway through the cooking add another 1/3 cup wine to the pan.    Transfer the meat to a deep non-metal dish just large enough to hold it.  Pour the marinade over the meat, and let it marinate, covered, in the  refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or up to 3 days. Bring the meat, in the  marinade, to room temperature before serving. Cut it in thin slices,  arrange on a serving platter, and spoon some of the marinade over the  slices.    Of course this dish can also be reheated in the marinade and served warm.    Source: CIAO ITALIA by Mary Ann Esposito
