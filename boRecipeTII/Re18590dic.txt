American Farm Sausages - 13
Cold water, Bay leaf; crushed, Black pepper, Cayenne pepper, Pork; grind medium, Ginger, Sage, Salt, 
It had a lot of recipes for country-style sausages. I made a half cup test  batch of 18 different recipes to see which one we liked. Here is the one we  liked the best. I made a 6# batch and formed it into patties and froze  them. I did not add the water. I am going to try smoking some the next time  I fire up the NBBD. I used fresh sage and bay from my herb garden.    Recipe by: Jerry Predika "The Sausage Making Cookbook"    Posted to bbq-digest by wight@odc.net on May 29, 1998
