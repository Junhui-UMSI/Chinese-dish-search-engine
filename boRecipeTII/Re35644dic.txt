Stuffed Angel Food Cake
Dozen red cherries; cut up, Unflavored gelatin, Boiling water, Angel food cake, Dozen whole almond macaroons, Bourbon, Sugar, Dozen marshmallows; cut up, Cold water, Whipped cream, 
Dissolve gelatin in cold water. Add boiling water & cool. Season with  bourbon. Add sugar & set aside. Tear off some of inside of cake & put a  little of it in the bottom of cake. Combine marshmallows, cherries,  macaroons & whipped cream. Add to gelatin mixture & refrigerate until it  begins to thicken. Fill cake with this mixture & refrigerate. Ice with  whipped cream before serving. (This sounds like a lot of trouble, but make  a day ahead. Very good & a pretty dessert to serve from table or buffet  style. An angel food cake mix makes a large & pretty cake. At Christmas  time use red or green cherries.)
