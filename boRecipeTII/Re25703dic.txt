B-B-Q Seitan
(2 to 3 strips,, Raw Seitan, Strips kombu sea vegetable, Oil for frying, B-B-Q sauce of choice, about 12 inches), 
Prep time: 1-1/2 to 2 hours (most of time is in cooking)    Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and fry Seitan pieces for a few minutes  on each side until lightly browned.  Soak kombu until soft, then cut into  sixteen pieces.  Line bottom of 9-inch baking dish with half the kombu.  Place a piece of fried Seitan on each piece of kombu, overlapping if  necessary, to make an even layer.  Place remaining pieces of kombu on top  of each piece of Seitan.  Pour B-B-Q sauce on top, then spread with a  spoon to cover surfaces.  Gently add enough water so that the Seitan  pieces are almost floating.  Cover and bake at 350 F. for one hour.  Add  more water if necessary to keep Seitan very moist.    This recipe has been developed by Bro. Ron Pickarski as part of his work  toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics held in  Frankfurt, Germany.
