The Best Ham Glaze in the World
yellow mustard, Ground cloves, Ground ginger, Brown Sugar, Dark Karo syrup, 
Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 5  minutes, stirring constantly. Let cool.    Brush on ham frequently during the last 30 minutes of baking.    My personal notes say... I copied this recipe from a cookbook borrowed from  Home Ec. department at school, but neglected to write down the name. Shame  on me. Ive used this with pork tenderloin. It makes a lot for a small  buffet ham, but is just right for a larger one. It keeps a long time in the  fridge.    Im using this Christmas for my ham. In addition, were having fried  oysters and baked turkey. With all that, I should not have to cook for at  least a week.....    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H.
