Potato Salad Without Mayonnase
Mayonnase, Potato Salad without, 
Boil as many potatos as you need.  Usually one per person and then a couple  of extras.   Let them cool completely.  Chop into small squares.  Add about  1/2 cup to a cup of olive oil and 2 tbsp vinagar.  Mix well.  Add oregano  and chopped garlic to taste and mix. Serve at room temp. Will keep well in  refrigerator and tastes even better when made a day in advance.    Recipe By     : KMallozzi    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
