Polish Sausage
Mustard seeds, water, Black pepper, Dried basil, Pork butt, Salt, Garlic powder, Sugar, Dried thyme, Dried marjoram, 
Cut pork into 1 1/2 " cubes, trimming all gristle and bone. Pass through a  meat grinder with a coarse blade. Adjust the fat-to-lean ratio to be about  1:3 if you can. Put pork in a large stainless or ceramic crock or bowl. Mix  the dry spices in a small bowl. Using your hands, toss the meat while  adding the spices a small amount at a time. When half the spices are in,  add half the ice water. Mix keeping the meat as loose as possible. Add  remaining spices & water as above. At this point you may fry a small patty  of the meat to test for seasonings. Adjust if necessary. Refrigerate the  sausage mix overnight. You may check for seasonings again the next day (but  be careful! Youll be tempted to fry it all right then and eat it up!)  Stuff the mix into about 5 of rinsed casings, tying off about 8" lengths.  You may grill, steam or fry the sausages as you prefer.
