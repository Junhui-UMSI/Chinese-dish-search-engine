Adding the  seeds of 1 jalapeno chile will not make the jelly hotter since the sugar,  the vinegar, and the cooking process tame (most) all the chiles. The  floatin seeds in the jar add character.    Using the knife blade of a processor, mince the peppers and chiles with  quick on and off pulsations.    In a 5 qt. pot, mix the peppers, chiles, seeds sugar and vinegar. Bring to  a rolling boil and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool for 5  minutes. Add the 6 ozs of pectin (certo) and stir continuously for 2  minutes. Allow the mixture to cool for another 2 minutes and the stir again  for 1 minute. This stirring will distribute the bits of pepper throughout  the jelly. Pour into jelly jars that have been strilized and seal  immediatly with lids that have been sterilized seperatly for 5 minutes.  Test seal, after cooling, with finger. If middle pops up when pressed, jar  is not sealed.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #85    From the MealMaster recipe list.
