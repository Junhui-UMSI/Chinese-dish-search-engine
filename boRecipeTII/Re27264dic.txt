Tiramisu - Olive Garden
Cream Cheese, Superfine sugar, Strong Black Coffee, Prepared Instant Espresso, Sponge Cake, Cocoa Powder, Brandy, 
*  Cream cheese or mascarpone should be at room temperature. Mascarpone is  available at some Italian specialty food stores and some gourmet food  stores. ~------------------------------------------------------  ~----------------- Cut across the middle of the sponge cake to form two  disks, about 1"-1-1/2" thick, each. Blend the coffee or espresso and  liqueur together.   Sprinkle the bottom half of the cake with the coffee liqueur blend, enough  to flavor it strongly, but dont saturate the cake so much that it will  collapse.  Mix the cream cheese or mascarpone with the sugar and beat the  cheese until the sugar is completely dissolved and the cheese is light and  spreadable.  Spread the bottom half off the cake with half of the creamy  cheese, in a fairly thick layer. Set the second half of the cake on the  bottom half and repeat the process - sprinkle the coffee/liqueur blend and  spread with the remaining cream cheese. Put the cocoa powder into a wire  strainer and coat the top layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa.  Refrigerate the cake for at least two hours before cutting and serving.
