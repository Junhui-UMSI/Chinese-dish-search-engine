Place chilis on a cookie sheet under the broiler until blistered, turning  to blister on all sides. Place them in a clean brown paper bag and fold  down the opening until cool. Then remove from bag and strip off the thin  peel. Gently slice off the stem and remove the seeds. You dont have to be  terribly compulsive about this.    Stuff the peppers with the beans and add a matchstick of cheese into each  chili.    Place in an oiled casserole and top with grated cheese. Bake at 350 F for  about 20-30 minutes until hot throughout and cheese is melted.    Serve with corn tortillas, corn chips, and some fresh salsa.
