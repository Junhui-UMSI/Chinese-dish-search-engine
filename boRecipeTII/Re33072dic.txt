1. Mince or grind pork and ginger root.       2. Blend cornstarch and cold water to a paste, then stir in salt and soy  sauce. Add to pork and ginger and mix well. Form into walnut-size balls,  but do not overhandle or pack too tightly. Meanwhile heat oil.       3. Add porkballs one at a time, and deep-fry several at once, turning  frequently for even cooking. When porkballs float, remove from pan and let  cool slightly.       4. Reheat oil. Return porkballs to fry 1 minute more. (Cut one open to  make sure meat is no longer pink.)
