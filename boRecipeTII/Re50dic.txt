Kale might be  nutritious, but often it is tough and chewy. We serve it raw as a  decoration; cooked only when I can use the large bunch.  Heres a recipe  that really works for me. I freeze it into cubes and add it to soups,  stews, and salad dressings!  I added the cilantro and lime options to the  recipe. -Pat Hanneman (kitpath@earthlink.net)    Recipe by: PHYTOPIA COOKBOOK by Gollman and Pierce (1998)    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by Pat Hanneman <kitpath@earthlink.net> on Oct 13,  1998,
