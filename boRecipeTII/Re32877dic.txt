Sweet Potatoes with Bourbon
Dark brown sugar, Fresh Lemon Juice, Medium unpeeled sweet, Finely grated lemon zest, Salt & freshly ground pepper, Good-quality bourbon, 
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Pierce the sweet potatoes a few times  and roast them in a large nonstick roasting pan for about 1 hour, or until  soft and browned on the bottom. (I just put them on foil laid directly on  the rack)  Let cool for 15 minutes.  Remove the skin, leaving as much  caramelized flesh as possible.  Cut the potatoes into large chunks and  transfer to a food processor.  Add the lemon juice and zest, season with  salt and pepper and process until smooth. (I had to do this in 2 batches  for my food processor. 5 lbs turned out to be 4 very large yams)    2.  In a large non-reactive saucepan, combine the bourbon and brown sugar  and bring just to a boil.  Add the sweet potatoes and stir until blended.  (MAKE AHEAD: The puree can be refrigerated for up to 1 day). warm over low  heat, then transfer to a large bowl and serve.
