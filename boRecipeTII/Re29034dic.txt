Butter 9x13" baking dish.  Combine 2 1/4 cups water, broth, shallots and  marjoram in heavy large Dutch oven; bring to boil. Mix 2 1/2 cups cold  water and cornmeal in bowl.

Season with salt and pepper. Immediately spread 2 cups polenta in prepared  dish.  Top with 1 3/4 cups cheese. Drizzle with 1/4 cup cream. Repeat  layering, using 2 cups polenta, 1 3/4 cups cheese, and 1/4 cup cream. Top  with remaining polenta.  Spread remaining cheese over. Cover with foil.  (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.

Uncover; continue baking until polenta  bubbles at edges and top begins to brown, about 10 minutes.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #273 by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Oct  17, 97
