Quick and Creamy Eggless Caesar Dressing
garlic, Salt, anchovy fillets, Dijon mustard, Fresh Lemon Juice, Grated Parmesan, Red wine vinegar, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Worcestershire Sauce, 
In the bowl of a food processor combine the mustard, Worcestershire,  garlic, vinegar, lemon juice and anchovy fillets. Pulse until the garlic  and anchovy fillets are well chopped. Scrap the sides of the bowl  occasionally to ensure even and uniform blending of the ingredients.    While running the processor continuously, pour the olive through the cap  into the processor bowl in a slow and steady stream, and process to a  smooth and creamy texture.    When all of the oil has been incorporated add the Parmesan cheese with one  final spin in the processor. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.    Pour into a clean container and refrigerate until ready to use.    Will keep for 4 to 5 days refrigerated.    >From Michaels Place Show #ML1A28    Recipe by: Michael Lomonaco Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #579 by "Master  Harper Gaellon" <gaellon@inch.com> on Apr 19, 1997
