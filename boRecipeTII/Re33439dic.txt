In a bowl, stir together the basil, butter, thyme, zest and salt and pepper  to taste until combined well. Spoon mixture onto a sheet of plastic wrap  and form into a 3-inch long log. Chill compound butter, wrapped well in  plastic wrap, until firm, at least 30 minutes, and up to 3 days.    Preheat oven to 475 degrees.    Discard gizzards form birds and trim necks flush with bodies if necessary.  Rinse birds inside and out and pat dry. Starting at neck end of each bird,  slide fingers between meat and skin to loosen skin (be careful not to tear  skin). Cut butter into eight 1/4-inch thick slices and gently push 4 slices  under skin of each bird, putting 1 slice over each breast half and thigh.  Tie legs of each bird together with kitchen string and secure wings to  sides with wooden picks or bamboo skewers.    Arrange birds in a flameproof roasting pan large enough to hold them  without crowding. Gently rub birds with lemon halves, squeezing juice over  them, and season with salt and pepper. Roast birds in middle of oven 30  minutes, or until an instant read thermometer inserted in thickest part of  a thigh registers 170 degrees.    Transfer birds to a platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Add  wine and stock to the roasting pan and deglaze over moderate heat, scraping  up brown bits. Transfer jus to a small saucepan. Skim fat from jus and  simmer until reduced to about 1/3 cup.    Garnish birds with herbs and serve with jus.
