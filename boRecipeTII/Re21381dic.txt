From: casey@well.sf.ca.us (Kathleen Creighton)  There have been several requests here lately for a *good* carrot cake  recipe and I havent seen any replies. I got this recipe from  rec.food.cooking in March, tried it out, and its *great*! The original  article was posted by Dorothy Westphal, westphal@iscnvx.lmsc.lockheed.com.    This recipe appeared in the San Jose (California) Mercury food section  about ten or fifteen years ago, and it has been my favorite ever since. The  flavor and texture of both cake and frosting are excellent, and it is EASY!    Mix until blended.  Pour into wax-paper lined pan, 13x9-inch.  Bake at 350  for 50 minutes. Cool. Top.    Cream Cheese Icing: Cream butter and cream cheese.  Beat in other stuff  till fluffy.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
