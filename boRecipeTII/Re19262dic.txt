ROUGHLY CHOP VEGETABLES into 1/4-inch pieces and set aside on a plate. Heat  the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the onion and cook,  stirring, for 5 minutes. Decrease heat to low, add the vegetables and cook  for 10 minutes. Remove vegetables from heat and scrape the mixture into a  food processor. Add the egg whites and bread crumbs and puree until smooth.  Stuff the mixture into sausage casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic  wrap. Poach the sausages in gently simmering water for 7 minutes, drain and  let cool. If you have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove it  when sausages are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To serve, grill  the sausages or place under a preheated broiler. Since the sausages are  already cooked, we want only to reheat them and crisp their skins.
