Sweet and Sour Potatoes
Vinegar, Salt, Bacon, slices, cut up, Pepper, Sugar, New potatoes, boiled in skin, Onion, diced, 
Peel and cube potatoes.  Add diced onion, salt, pepper, and sugar. Reserve  in a covered bowl.  In a small frypan, fry the bacon until crisp. Add the  vinegar to the hot bacon and bring to a boil.  Pour immediately over potato  mixture, mix well.  If too tart, add a little more sugar before serving.  Cut endive or leaf lettuce added to this is very good.
