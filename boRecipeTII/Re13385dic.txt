PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Pat the meat dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper as  desired. Heat the oil in a large covered casserole or Dutch oven over high  heat on top of the stove. Add the meat, without crowding, in batches if  necessary, and brown well on all sides. Remove pieces to a plate as they  are done and reserve. Repeat until all meat is browned. Pour off any  remaining fat, and replace the casserole over medium heat. Add the onion,  half the carrots, celery, garlic and tomato paste. Cook 5 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Use your spoon to loosen and dissolve the brown bits stuck to  the bottom of the casserole. Add flour and cook, stirring, an additional  minute. Add the wine and cook for about a minute to burn off the alcohol.  Replace the meat (and any juices on the plate) in the casserole and add the  stock, peppercorns and thyme. Cover, bring to a boil and place in the oven  for 1 1/4-to-1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender. Meanwhile, combine  potatoes, remaining carrots and butter with 1/2 cup of water in a medium  saucepan over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes. Add the turnips and cook,  stirring occasionally, until all water is evaporated, leaving the  vegetables bathed in butter, about another 5 minutes. Add the peas, remove  from the heat and set aside. Remove the casserole from the oven. Using a  slotted spoon, remove the meat from the sauce and place it in a bowl. Pour  the sauce through a fine strainer into another bowl and discard the  vegetables and spices that remain in the strainer. Replace meat in the pot,  add the cooked vegetables and the sauce. Cover and place over medium heat  for 5 minutes. Serve piping hot.
