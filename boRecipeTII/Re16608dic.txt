The three of us love this pickled beet recipe from Farm House Cookbook.  1. Trim beet stems, leaving 1/2 inch of stem intact. Do not trim roots.    2. Bring water to a boil in the bottom of a vegetable steamer. Add beets,  cover, and steam until nearly tender but still offer resistance when tested  with a sharp knife about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove steamer basket from heat.    3. While beets are steaming, combine vinegar, sugar, spices, and herbs in a  saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Lower heat and keep warm.    4. When beets are cool enough to handle, carefully scrape off the skin,  trim the stem and root ends. Slice the beets into 1/8 inch thick slices and  place in glass bowl. Cover with warm vinegar mix and set aside to cool.  When cool, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before using. They  will keep for about 3 weeks.
