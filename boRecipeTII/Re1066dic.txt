Source: Dawn Shuman Institute cooking class/Chicago    Mix flour, salt and pepper. Coat chicken in this (I used plastic bag) Brown  chicken in oil (you may have to add a bit more oil). take chicken out and  set aside. Add onions and mushrooms. Cook and stir until onions are tender.  If there is any fat left in pan, drain. (I skin the chicken, so I dont  have any fat left over). Stir in the remaining ingredients, add chicken  back to pan, cover and simmer for one hour and 15 minutes or until tender.  Remove bay leaf. Skim off the fat. Suggested to serve in a tureen or  casserole with sauce over chicken. You can, if you want, add small peeled  whole potatoes after 45 minutes of cooking.
