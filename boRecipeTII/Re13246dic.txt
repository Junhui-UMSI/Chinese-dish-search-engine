Roll out dough with a rolling pin or pasta maker until dough  is paper thin. Cut into 6" squares. Place about 3 Tbls. of any  filling in the center of each wrapper.  Fold up bottom corners, then  sides & roll up tightly to make a sealed package.    **Looks like an eggroll. Continue making the rest of the rolls until  dough has been used.  Brush rolls with egg, beaten & deep fry them at  375 for 4 minutes until golden brown.  Drain & serve hot.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
