This is a favorite in my house, from _Fat Free & Delicious_ by Siegel. He  calls it--    Bring stock or water to a boil. Add all ingredients. Boil until all veggies  are soft, approximately 30 minutes. Let cool slightly, place in a blender  or food processor, a batch at a time and blend until smooth. Return to pot,  keep warm on low heat for 15 minutes.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Jan Gordon" <jan@gordon.com> on Sep 29, 1998,
