PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F with rack in center of oven. Generously grease 2  8-inch layer cake pans. Dust with flour, tapping pans over sink to remove  excess flour. FOR CAKE, sift flour, baking powder and salt together onto  waxed paper; set aside. Use mixer to cream shortening and sugar until  fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add  vanilla. Combine well. Add reserved flour mixture alternately with milk,  mixing until smooth. Divide batter between prepared pans. Use back of spoon  to spread batter evenly; this takes a little patience. FOR MERINGUE, beat  egg whites until they are thick and hold their shape but are still soft and  moist. Add sugar by the tablespoon, beating well after each addition.  Divide between pans. Use spatula to spread over batter. Sprinkle with nuts,  dividing evenly. Bake until lightly colored and toothpick inserted into  center comes out clean (its OK if meringue cracks), about 30 minutes. Let  rest 10 minutes in pans on cooling racks. Use flexible knife to release  cake from sides of pan. Gently invert cakes. Set them meringue-side up to  cool completely. Spread one meringue layer with filling. Top with other  layer, meringue-side up. Its best served the day it is made but it can be  made a day ahead and kept cool (but not refrigerated). If made ahead, keep  covered. Yield: 1 8-inch layer cake. VANILLA CUSTARD FILLING: Combine  sugar, cornstarch and salt in heavy 1-quart saucepan. Stir in egg yolk and  milk. Stir over medium heat. Stir until mixture coats spoon, about 4  minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla. Let cool completely. If mixture  becomes lumpy, whisk vigorously, before using.
