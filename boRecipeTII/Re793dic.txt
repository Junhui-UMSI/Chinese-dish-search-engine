Hasty Habanero Jelly
Habanero chilies; About, Rice vinegar, Sugar, Jars apple jelly; (10 oz, 
I ran across the following while reading my newest copy of Sunset (Oct.  98):    Prep & cook time: about 25 minutes    Makes: 4 jars, 10 oz each    Rinse chilies and cut off stem ends. Wearing gloves or holding chilies with  a fork (do not touch with bare hands), cur chilies in half lengthwise.  Slice out and discard veins and seeds. Cut chilies into 1/8- to 1/16-inch  slivers. Put chilies, vinegar, and sugar in a 4- to 5-quart pan. Bring to a  boil over high heat, stirring often, and boil until mixture is reduced to  about 1/3 cup, about 7 minutes.    Scrape jelly from jars into pan. Stirring often, boil until jelly melts.  Ladle hot jelly back into the unwashed jars to within 1/4 inch of rims.  Wipe rims clean and screw lids onto jars. (If there is a little extra  jelly, pour into a small dish and cover when cool.)    After 1-1/2 hours, gently shake jelly in jars to redistribute chili pieces  if they have floated to the top. When jelly is cool, use or store in the  refridgerator up to 3 months.    Notes: Other fresh chilies that work are West Indian (as hot as habaneros);  milder but still hot cayenne, Fresno, jalapeno, Santa Fe grande and  serrano; and milder still hungarian Wax. If desired, double the amount of  the milder ones.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by "Bloechl, Sharen Rund"  <sharen.rund.bloechl@lmco.com> on Sep 18, 1998, converted by MM_Buster  v2.0l.
