Katjang Sauce (Katjang= Peanut)
Peanutbutter., Onion, Water; (the sauce ought to, Red pepper., Soysauce, Lemon juice, A bit salt, Sugar., A bit vinegar, 
chop onions and pepper finely, and mix them with the peanutbutter. While  stirring pour the water, add the vinegar, soysauce,and lemonjuice. Let the  sauce boil for about 5 minutes. Keep stirring, it may burn. Mix the salt  and sugar with it. Instead of pepper you can use a bit salsa sauce. Make it  as hot as you like, or -when you dont like hot at all- use tomatoketchup.  A bit coffeecream is good in it too.    I myself use much more spices and herbs in this. You can eat this with  white rice, as I said, and pieces of chicken or turkey fried with an onion  and a bit soysauce.
