Tony Romas Baby Backs
Garlic powder, Onion powder, Vinegar, Sugar, TABASCO pepper sauce, Dark corn syrup, Ketchup, Salt, 
Combine the above ingredients.    Heat over high heat until boiling.    Reduce heat, simmer 30-40 minutes until thick.    Coat 4 pounds of baby back pork ribs, front and back, with BBQ sauce.    AM Northwest television show -- Channel 2, Portland, Oregon, posted this at  their website. My guess is that someone from T.R. demonstrated the making  of the BBQ sauce. The exact information was not posted at the website.
