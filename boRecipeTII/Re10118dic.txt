Quenelles of Chocolate Mousse
Double cream (heavy cream), Sugar, Butter, soft, Eggs, Chocolate, 
Melt chocolate slowly in a Bain marie then off the heat but in a warm spot  beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Whisk in butter in small amounts until  smooth and glossy. Whisk whites to soft medium peaks and mount with sugar.  Fold into chocolate mix making sure no whites or lumps are visible . Make  sure that the whites dont cool the mix down so fast that the chocolate  goes solid on you. Place in shallow dish cover and cool in the fridge.  Chill the double cream. After one hour in the fridge remove the mousse and  the cream  take a warm silver spoon  and form quenelles of alternate  colours on to the serving plate return to fridge till service. Just prior  to serving lightly dust the mousse with icing sugar and the cream with  cocoa add a strawberry and Bobs your Uncle Beautifull!!!!!!!!!!!!!
