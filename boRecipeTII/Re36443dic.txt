Beer Margarita
Ice cubes, Frozen Concentrated, Tequilla, Beer, 
C STEVEN MCMAHAN <MCMAHS@swt02.swt.usace.army.mil>    Note: After scanning the wonderful recipes that were featured at the SF  get-together, I decided to submit one myself. This, like the ale recipe, is  not chile, but is a good way to wash it down.  Dont laugh but here it  is...    Combine ingredients in blender, add a couple of ice cubes and blend  briefly. Allow to set for a few minutes. Pour contents over ice in salt  rimmed glass.    If youre so inclined I suppose you could add more ice and make a frozen  version.  I "discovered" this recipe during happy hour at a local  establishment.  The bartender told me that it was cheaper to produce than  the traditional method of using triple sec. Another tip is to open the beer  that you plan to use, and let it set for a while prior to mixing. This will  keep the mix from foaming up too badly.
