from Sizzling Southwestern Cookery by Lisa Golden Schroeder    These enchiladas ave very different from most classic renditions - and I  think theyre even better!    1. In small shallow baking dish, mix first seven ingredients. Cover and  refrigerate at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally.    2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high  heat. Saute chicken-marinade mixture until chicken is no longer pink, about        4    minutes.    3. Wrap tortillas in damp dish towel. In bottom of 13x9x2-inch baking dish,  spread 3/4 cup of enchilada sauce.    4. Working with one trotilla at a time (keep others covered), spoon about 2  tablespoons chicken mixture down center or each tortilla and sprinkle with  1 1/2 tablespoons cheese. Roll tortillas up tightly and place seam-side  down in baking dish.    5. Pour remaining sauce over rolled tortillas. Sprinkle with remaining  cheese. Gake uncovered until heated through and bubbly, about 30 minutes.    6. Serve with sour cream, salsa, and beans.    Makes 6 servings.
