Potato Cheese (And Optional Vegetables) Soup
garlic, Skim milk, parsley, fresh, Chicken broth***, Potatoes, Sharp cheddar *, Fresh broccoli**, Carrot, Powdered cayenne, salt and pepper, Butter, Onion, Cream cheese*, Water ***, Dried dill, 
Brendas Notes:    This is a yellow, cheese saucy looking soup base with green broccoli added  at the last. It is yummy just as it is. (The kind you cant have just one  bowl of.) Even with the lower fat ingredients, it tastes fattening!    You could add more last minute veges and meats -- leftovers, perhaps. Could  work as an easy clean-out-the-fridge soup.    IT IS GOOD! Next time I make it, I will also parboil up some celery and  (more) carrot chunks and (more) onions to throw in at the last with the  broccoli.    * I used fat free cream cheese. For the Cheddar Cheese, I used mostly (8  ounces) Bandons reduced fat cheddar cheese (the best tasting lower fat  cheddar found in Oregon) and about 1/2 cup of full fat cheddar.    ** Can use frozen. I used chopped up fresh and let it be a tad crunchy.    *** I used 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth, poured into measuring cup and  then added water to bring measure to 2 cups.    Directions for soup:    In soup pot, saute garlic & onion in butter until lightly browned. Then add  vegetables, chicken broth and water (or veg broth) to pot. Cover & simmer  for 30-40 minutes until veggies are tender. Use emulsiphier to puree. (OR  add the milk and pour mixture into blender & puree.) Return to pot, add  milk and spices, cheese and broccoli (and other vegetables/meats, if any)  and simmer until cheese melts and broccoli softens a little. Serve topped  with chopped chives or parsley (optional).    Notes that came with the original recipe:    This cheese soup is lower in fat than standard versions. If you want to use  low fat cheese to reduce the amount of fat even further, make sure it has a  strong, aged flavor. I recommend using a low fat yellow smoked cheddar.
