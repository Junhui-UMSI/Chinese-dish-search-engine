Veal and Mushroom Ragout
Large whole mushrooms, Dry vermouth, Chopped parsley, Thick sliced bacon, Leeks ( 2 lbs.) cut into 1", Flour, Salt, Veal, in 2" cubes, Pepper, Frozen artichoke hearts;, 
Two hours before serving or if doing in Microwave, 1 hour before serving:  trim leeks and cut into 1/2" rings. Rinse well and drain well. Dice bacon  and cook in 10" skillet until browned and crisp. With slotted spoon remove  bacon to paper towel. Pour off all but 1 T. fat, reserving rest. In  skillet, over Med-High heat, cook leeks until browned. With slotted spoon  remove leeks to 3 qt. casserole or Microwave casserole. In 2 T more bacon  fat or oil, cook mushrooms until browned. Remove with slotted spoon to  casserole. Leave drippings in pan. Coat veal with flour in plastic bag.  Cook in drippings over Med-High heat, 1/3 at a time until well browned.  Remove as browned to casserole. Add vermouth, salt, pepper and water to  skillet. Stir to loosen brown bits. Stir into ingredients in casserole.  Cover and bake at 350 F. for 45 minutes or Microwave on High for 15  minutes. Stir several times if doing in Microwave. Stir in artichokes,  broken. Cover and bake for 15 minutes more or Microwave on Med-High for  about 3 minutes. (I added a little more water at this point to allow a  little juice for serving over rice.) Cook until all ingredients are tender.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley and drained cooked bacon bits.
