Sweet Yeast Crust
Egg; Large, Lightly Beaten, Salt, Unbleached Flour; Sifted, Sugar; Granulated, milk, Water; Warm, 110-115 deg. F., Butter, Active Dry Yeast; 1 Pk., 
Lightly grease the baking pan.  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. In a  large mixing bowl, mix the flour, sugar and salt until well blended. In a  saucepan, heat the milk and butter, then cool to lukewarm. Add the warm  milk and the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients, then add the egg. Blend  well to form a moist soft dough. Knead lightly until the dough is soft and  smooth.  Return the dough to a clean greased bowl and cover with a damp  towel.  Set the dough in a warm place to rise. Let rise for 1 hour or until  doubled in size.  When the dough is ready, punch it down and pat it into a  thin layer.  Place the layer into the bottom of the pan folding the excess  dough up the sides of the pan making it as smooth as possible. Allow the  dough to rise again, in the pan until it is doubled, bout 30 to 45 minutes.  When the dough is double the crust is ready to be filled.
