Almond Butter Cookies
Almond butter, Pure vanilla extract, Whole wheat pastry flour, Salt, Canola oil, Maple syrup, 
Preheat oven to 300F. Lightly grease a baking sheet (or use a nonstick  one). Mix together almond butter and oil; beat until smooth. Mix in maple  syrup and vanilla extract. Stir together flour and salt. Add to almond  butter mixture and mix until just combined. Cover and refrigerate for 10  minutes. Roll dough into 3/4-inch balls. Place on baking sheet and flatten  with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, until bottoms are  lightly browned. Cool a couple of minutes on the baking sheet, then  transfer to a cooling rack. Eat. Variation: try with other nut butters.
