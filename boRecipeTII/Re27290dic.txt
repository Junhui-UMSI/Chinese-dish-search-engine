Prepare a wood or charcoal fire and let it burn down to embers.    Place oysters flat side down on grill. As the oysters start to open remove  them and place in the ice cold vermouth marinade. Allow the oysters to  cool. Remove them from the marinade. Remove the flat part of the shell and  cut the mussel loose on other shell, reserving all liquid. Pour 1 teaspoon  of the juice over the oysters on the half shell. Garnish with fresh dill.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #148 by "Vince & Juley Roberts"  <vince@bellsouth.net> on May 28, 1997
