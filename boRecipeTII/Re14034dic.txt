When the chocolate are melted let it  cool off. Then gently turn the light whipped cream in too the chocolate  mixture and frees it in a metal container till it is half frozen then stir  till it gets soft and put it back in the freezer, until it is served.    If you have the time stir the mixture more often in to the freezer prevent  ice flakes.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
