Taking Liberty Ale
Irish moss 15 minutes, Klages 2-row Malt, Wyeast 1056 American ale, Cascade (5.5%) 30 minutes, 90L Crystal Malt, Cascade (5.5%) dry hopped, Corn sugar to prime, Chinook (12%) 60 minutes, 40L Crystal Malt, 
Mash all grains for 90 minutes at 150 F, adjust PH as needed. Mashed off at  170F, sparged with 170F water. This has a total BU of 43.7. If you dont  reach around 1.060, adjust the dry hopping accordingly. In the 1990 Special  Zymurgy Issue on Hops, Quentin B. Smith  recommends Chinook at 24 BU,  Cascade at 12 BU, Cascade at 9  dry  hopped  (total 45BU). OG=1.062. Later,  he wins first place in the Pale Ale catagory  in the 1991 AHA Nationals  with a recipe that uses 14 pounds Klages,  4  oz 40L crystal, 4 oz 90L  crystal (and of course different hops  :-).  This had a OG=1.062 and  TG=1.010. He mashed all grains for  90  minutes  at 150F. Mashed off at  170F, sparged with 170F water.
