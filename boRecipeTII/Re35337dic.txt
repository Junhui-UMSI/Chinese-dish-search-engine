Beef Brisket with Onion-Lemon Marmalade
Lemons, Brown sugar, Port, Coarsely ground pepper, Garlic, Onions, Mixed herbs, Beef brisket, 
Trim excess fat from brisket. In a roasting pan, place onion slices, lemon  slices and garlic. Lay brisket on top of vegetables.    Mix together port, brown sugar, and herbs; stir until sugar dissolves, then  pour evenly over brisket. Sprinkle brisket with pepper and cover roasting  pan tightly with foil. Bake in a 300 degree F oven until brisket is very  tender when pierced, about four hours. Brisket can be cooled and  refrigerated at this point until one is ready for the finishing.    When brisket is tender, uncover pan and return it to the oven (raise  temperature to 450 degrees F) to brown the meat slightly, about 20 minutes.  Remove brisket from pan.    Skim off fat from pan juices and put in sauce pan. Boil juices and  vegetables, uncovered, stirring often. As mixture thickens, reduce heat to  medium and stir constantly; cook until thick and shiny, and reduced to  about 1-3/4 cups (20-30 minutes). Add salt to taste. To serve, slice across  the grain. Spoon marmalade over brisket. Garnish with lemon "bows" and  chopped parsley if desired.    Yield: 10-12    NOTES : Source:  St Mary Mead Archives  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #329 by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net>  on Dec 19, 1997
