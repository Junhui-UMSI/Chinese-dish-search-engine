Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegetable oil.    Put the chicken in a large bowl with ice water.  Put the yogurt into a  medium bowl. Set both bowls aside.    * The secret to the success of this recipe is to make sure that both the  chicken and the yogurt are very cold (hence, soaking the chicken in the ice  water). The preliminary soaking will help the breading adhere and produce a  crisp coating much like that of fried chicken.    Toss all the breading ingredients into a large, tightly-sealing plastic  bag. Seal and shake well to mix.    Remove 2 pieces of chicken from the ice water.  Roll each piece in the  yogurt.  Put the chicken into the plastic bag, reseal, and shake to coat  thoroughly. Transfer the breaded chicken to the prepared baking sheet.  Repeat the process until all 12 pieces are breaded. Spray the chicken  lightly with the vegetable oil.    Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven and bake for 1 hour,  turning the pieces every 20 minutes to allow even browning.    Serve hot or at room temperature.
