WONTONS:  In small bowl combine pork, scallions, teriyaki sauce, cornstarch  and ginger, mixing well. Spoon an equal amount of pork mixture (about 1/2  teaspoon) onto center of each wonton wrapper; moisten edges of wrappers  with water and fold wrappers in half, triangle-fashion, enclosing filling  and forming 20 wontons. Press edges together to seal; bring base corners of  each triangle together, overlapping corners, and press to seal. Cover and  refrigerate until ready to use.    SOUP:  In 3-quart saucepan bring 2 quarts water to a boil. Add wontons and,  when wontons rise to surface, cook for 1 minute longer. Using slotted  spoon, remove wontons to plate and set aside. Discard cooking liquid.    In 1-quart saucepan bring remaining 3 cups water to a boil; add broth mix  and stir to dissolve.  Add spinach and mushrooms and cook for 1 minute; add  wontons and cook until heated through.    Makes 4 servings; about 3/4 cup soup and 5 wontons each.
