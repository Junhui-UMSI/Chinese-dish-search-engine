Preserved Goose
Ground bay leaves, Salt, Quatre epices OR, Allspice OR, Ground thyme, Chinese 5-spice powder, Large goose, 
Cut the goose into serving pieces, saving the fat. Rub the pieces  with salt and seasonings. Pack them in a big deep dish and cover with  more salt. Leave in a cool place or the fridge for 24 hr.    Render the fat in a big kettle. Escoffier says that if your goose is  a good one, you should expect at least 3 lb 6 oz of fat from it!    Next day, rinse and dry the goose pieces. Melt the rendered fat and  drop the pieces in. They should be completely covered with fat. Cook  over low heat 2 1/2 to 3 hr.    Pack the goose pieces in a sterilized crock and pour the fat over.  The fat should cover the pieces. Let the fat solidify and then pour  over all 2 c of melted lard. When this is set, cover crock with a  piece of butcher paper and tie it down or else put the lid of the  crock on.    This will keep a long time - its best after at least a week. If you  refrigerate it, or if youre using it within a day or two, you dont  have to go through the melted lard and butcher paper routine. BTW,  the lard is discarded, but the goose fat is kept for sauteing and  other uses.
