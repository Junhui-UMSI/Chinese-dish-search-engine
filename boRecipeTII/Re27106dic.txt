Thyme-Marinated Grilled Asparagus
Grainy mustard, Shallots, Orange juice concentrate, Garlic, Red wine vinegar, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Asparagus, Salt and black pepper, fresh thyme, 
Bring 2 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add asparagus  and cook until it is crisp-tender, 3 or 4 minutes, depending on the size.  Drain and shock in cold ice water. Set aside.    In a bowl combine vinegar, shallots, garlic, thyme, orange juice  concentrate, and mustard. Slowly whisk in the oil to blend well. Season  with salt and pepper.    Pour mixture over asparagus. Let marinate while you light the coals or  start the grill.    To make the grilling easier, you can place the asparagus on skewers,  running a skewer through each end of the spear and fitting about 5 spears  on each pair of skewers. Grill the asparagus on each side just to mark it,  1 or 2 minutes per side. Remove from the grill. Serve warm or at room  temperature.
