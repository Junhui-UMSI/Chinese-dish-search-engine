>From _A Taste of Tradition_ by Ruth Sirkis    Peel and grate the potatoes on a coarse grater and drain.  Peel and grate  the onion and the apple.    Beat the eggs lightly in a medium bowl.  Add the grated potatoes, onion and  apple and blend well.  Add salt, flour, and baking powder.  Mix thoroughly.    Pour about 1 inch of oil into a large skillet and heat.  Drop the pancake  mixture by tablespoons into the hot oil.  Fry and brown on both sides.    Note:  You can use an electric blender for grating.  Cut each potato into 8  pieces, put in the blender and cover with water.  Close the lid and blend  at medium speed for 5 seconds.  Drain completely through a mesh sieve. Put  the potatoes into a bowl and proceed immediately.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 13 October 96    Date:    Mon, 14 Oct 1996 13:11:55 +0300    From:    Anat Levi <anat@OPTICS.JCT.AC.IL>
