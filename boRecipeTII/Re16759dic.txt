*    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost  reasons. **   Probably a modern addition, or  replacement for suet. You may change the proportions  of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken,  etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You  can use partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the  meats together long enough to make the bones separate  from the meat by themselves. Reserve the resulting  broth and set meats aside.  In a large bowl place the thinly sliced bread and add  the reserved broth. Cover with a towel and, as soon as  the bread is soft enough, mash it with an wooden  spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri,  paprika and a little salt. Add the meats cut in very  little pieces. Mix thoroughly. When everything is  completely mixed add the olive oil and the pork  drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable  funnel. Tie each alheira so that its about 8" long,  with the filling concentrated in the middle section,  leaving the ends almost empty. Smoke for 2 or 3 hours  a day, for a week. Tie both ends together before  selling or using - the alheira should be U shaped.  A typical way of serving alheiras is frying them in  hot oil, and presenting them with fried eggs and  potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side dish.
