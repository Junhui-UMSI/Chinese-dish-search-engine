Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza
Cheddar cheese, Prepared mustard, Dill pickle chunks, Onion, Bacon, Ground beef, 
Fry bacon until almost done (it will cook a bit more in the oven). Drain on  paper towel. Cook the ground beef until it is no longer pink - drain.  Saute the onion in a small amount of oil until it is soft.    Bake your favorite pizza crust at 425 degrees for 5 - 10 minutes just until  it begins to brown. Remove from oven and spread with mustard. Top with  ground beef and onion and return to oven for another 5 - 10 minutes until  crust edges are lightly browned. Add the bacon, pickles and cheese and  return to the oven until the cheese has melted. Remove from the oven and  enjoy.    Note: If you dont like warm pickles, you can add them just before servng.
