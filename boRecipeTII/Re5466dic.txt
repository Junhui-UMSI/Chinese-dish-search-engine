Notes: I have been in this mail group for about a month and seen alot of  discussions about the hottest sauce and have not heard anyone mention any  of the sauces in the book "Hot Licks" by Jennifer Trainer Thompson.    Either it is an unfound gem or an old pase book.  Either way it has a good  compendium of commercially available sauces as well as recipes for sauces  divided into "Piques & Sherries", "Louisina-Style Sauces", "Carribean-Style  Sauces", "Sauce Of The Border" and "Specialty Sauces and World Heat".  They  have great names like "F-16 Afterburner", and "Death Wish".    I have not been too fond of the Raw Habenero flavor but I really enjoy the  fire they empail you with.  However, I found a habanero based sauce in the  book that does appeal to me and is to die for.  I cant wait until fresh  habaneros are available and Im gonna make a vat of this stuff:    Place chiles, onion, pineapple juice, and spices in blender and puree until  smooth.  In a saucepan over low heat, dissolve cornstarch in the vinegar,  add the puree and honey, and simmer slowly for ten minutes. Mix with lime  juice and pour over fresh-cut tropical fruit.
