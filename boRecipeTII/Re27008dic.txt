Thinly slice the squash and potatoes. Starting with the potatoes,  alternately layer potatoes and squash in the baking dish. Sprinkle with  salt, pepper, sage and small dabs of goat cheese every couple of layers.  When the baking dish is full, carefully pour over the cream, allowing it to  soak between the layers. Stop when the cream is just below the top layer.  Sprinkle the top with Heluva Good shredded Italian cheese. Cover with foil  and bake until a knife slips easily into the middle of the gratin. Remove  the foil and allow to set for 20 minutes before serving.    Recipe by: Rox Run Vineyards    Posted to recipelu-digest by Nesb2@aol.com on Feb 26, 1998
