This three-loaf recipe takes advantage of fresh sweet potatoes -- or you  can use canned.    Cook sweet potatoes in boiling water to cover 20 to 30 minutes or until  tender; drain, reserving 2/3 cup liquid. Mash potatoes; set potatoes and  liquid aside. Combine flour and next 5 ingredients in a large bowl; make a  well in center of mixture. Combine sweet potatoes, reserved liquid, eggs,  oil, and sugar, stirring well; add to flour mixture, stirring just until  moistened. Stir in pecans and raisins. Pour batter evenly into 3 greased  and floured 8- x 4-inch loafpans.    Bake at 350? for 1 hour or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes  out clean, covering with aluminum foil after 50 minutes to prevent  excessive browning.    Cool in pans on a wire rack 10 minutes; remove from pans, and cool on wire  racks. Store in airtight containers overnight.    Yield: 3 loaves.    * 1 (14 1/2 -ounce) can cooked mashed sweet potatoes may be substituted.  Substitute 1 (6-ounce) can pineapple juice for 2/3 cup potato liquid.
