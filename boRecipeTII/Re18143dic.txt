Using a sharp knife, slice the kernels of fresh corn from their cobs into a  bowl, being careful not to cut too deeply into the cob. Put in a food  processor and grind fine. Place the chicken stock in a saucepan and bring  to a boil. Add the corn, salt, white pepper, and fresh ginger, stirring  constantly. Bring to a boil again. Turn to a low heat and cook for 5  minutes. Pour in the cornstarch mixture. Stir constantly until the soup has  thickened and become clear. Immediately pour in the egg whites, still  stirring. Add crabmeat. Turn off the heat and quickly pour the hot soup  into a tureen and sprinkle with chopped scallions.
