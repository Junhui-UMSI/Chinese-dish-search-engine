From: A4422DAD@helios.edvz.univie.ac.at (Gabriele DANNINGER)    Date: Fri, 04 Feb 94 16:30:37 MEZ  Beat egg whites at high speed. When it is stiff, add sugar, almonds,  vanilla and lemon peel. Roast carefully on low heat (20-30 min.). Spread  pignoli, roll on it small pieces of the almond paste and form "Kipferl"  (rolls?, moonshaped). Put on wax paper or on greased cookie sheets and bake  (its more drying than baking) at very low heat (about 50 celsius) 10-15  minutes.    Delicious!!!!
