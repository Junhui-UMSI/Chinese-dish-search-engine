Baba Ghannouj
Salt, GARNISH, Crushed red pepper, Parsley, Olive oil (this one is, Clove garlic (or more), Use any or all or improvise, Pomegranate seeds, Eggplant, Tahini (sesame seed paste), Lemon juice (2 lemons), Green Pepper, 
Cut a slit in the eggplant and roast it in a 400 degree oven for about 30  minutes or until soft. (If camping you can grill it) Run under cold water  and peel off skin.    Mash up the eggplant and add tahini, garlic, lemon juice and salt.    Spread on a plate or a shallow dish, sprinkle with red pepper and whatever  other garnish you like. Pour 2 -3 Tbsp of olive oil on top to cover thinly.    Serve cold or at room temp (best) with triangles of pita bread or cubes of  frensh sourdough for dipping.    NOTE: You can bake and add an onion for variation and/or add a peeled,  finely chopped tomato. I have also used yoghurt mixed in instead of olive  oil on top (althouhg this sort of makes the stuff look like someone ate it  already - but it tastes good!)    This is simple enought to prepare while camping or for an outdoor buffet  where refrigeration may be a problem. It is best eaten immediately after  being prepared.
