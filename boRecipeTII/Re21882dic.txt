Apple-Stuffed Pork Chops
Onion, Seedless raisins, Cinnamon, Pepper, Nutmeg, Salt, Water, Dry bread crumbs, Green apple, pork rib, Butter, 
Split the chops through the middle from the outer edge toward the bone,  leaving meat attached to the bone. Open like a book and pound both sides  thin with a mallet. Season the chops with 1/2 of the salt and the pepper.  Saute the onion and bread crumbs in butter in a heavy skillet. Add the  apple slices, raisins, remaining salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and water. Mix  together well and spread the dressing in even portions on the chops. Fold  over and fasten with toothpicks. Heat oven to 350 degrees and bake for 1  1/2 hours or until tender. Turn once during baking time and drain off  excess fat. Serves 6.
