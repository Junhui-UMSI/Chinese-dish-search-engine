Yet Another Barbecue Sauce
Pork Drippings (bacon), Sugar, Bottle Heinz 57 Sauce, Cayenne pepper, Chili powder, Black pepper, Vinegar, Garlic salt, Worcestershire Sauce, Ketchup, 
Combine all the ingredients and simmer until thick. When you use this  remember it is really a glaze, not a sauce. You can thin it with Canadian  beer before use. This is not as hot as it sounds but it is spicy.    Typed for you by Peggy and Bruce Travers,Cyberealm BBS Watertown NY  315-786-1120
