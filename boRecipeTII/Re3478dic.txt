Pecan Log
Box crushed vanilla wafers, Pecans, Sweetened condensed milk, 
(from Taste of Home)    Mix together the vanilla wafers and pecans. Then add 1 can sweetened  condensed milk (I use the fat free). Divide into 2 parts (since starting to  use this recipe, I have started dividing into 4 parts). Put the mixture on  waxed paper and roll into logs using the waxed paper. Place rolls in  aluminum foil and refrigerate before slicing.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Waanda B. Lee" <wlee@RA.MSSTATE.EDU> on Feb 2,  1998
