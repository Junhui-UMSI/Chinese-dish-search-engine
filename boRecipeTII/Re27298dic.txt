It all depends on what kind and how much chile  pepper you add, so you can make any recipe as hot as you like.     Cook ground beef, onions, green pepper, celery, and garlic in large pan  till meat is browned.  Do not drain.  Stir in undrained tomatoes, and  remaining ingredients except kidney beans. Simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 hrs.,  stirring occasionally.  Stir in beans and cook another 30 minutes.     "T.nt (sdm-marked) Chili was judged extra hot by our panel of hot-food enthusiasts.  One  of the tasters began to sweat after a few bites.  All of the panelists  agreed that each bite was noticeably hotter, but enjoyed the chili down to  the last spoonful."
