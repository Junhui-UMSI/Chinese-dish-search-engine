To Make Tomato Sauce: Saute onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat  for about 10 minutes, or until translucent but not browned. Add thyme and  carrot, cook 5 minutes over medium heat and add tomatoes. Bring to boil,  lower heat to just bubbling and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Season with salt to taste and set aside.    To Make Stuffed Zucchini: Preheat oven to 450 degrees.    Trim zucchini and cut in half lengthwise. Using a spoon or a melon baller,  remove a canal down center of each zucchini half, leaving a 1/4-inch all  around and the ends closed. Roughly chop the excess zucchini flesh and set  aside.    In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat olive oil until just smoking. Add onion  and garlic and cook over medium high heat until softened, about 6 to 7  minutes. Add zucchini pieces and crumbled lamb and cook until lamb is  cooked through, about 10 minutes. Drain fat from lamb mixture and place in  a large mixing bowl. Add eggs, half of the mint leaves and tomato sauce and  mix well. Season both the mixture and the zucchini boats with salt and  pepper. Stuff the lamb mixture into zucchini boats and pile high. Place in  an oven-proof baking dish just large enough to hold the 8 pieces and  sprinkle with bread crumbs. bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crisp on top  and remove. Serve warm or at room temperature with a chicory salad and  sprinkle with remaining mint leaves.
