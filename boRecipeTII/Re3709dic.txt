Penne Artichoke Pasta
Bell pepper (or mixed, Stalk celery, chopped, Diced tomatoes (fresh works, Penne pasta (I prefer La, Cloves garlic, minced or, Artichoke hearts, diced, Onion, 
Saute celery, onion, garlic, and peppers in water or some of the artichoke  liquid. (I use a little olive oil for flavor, a drizzle to 1 tsp). Cook  until soft. Drain artichokes and braise for 1-2 minutes, add tomatoes, with  liquid. If you prefer a more sauce-like mixture, save the liquid from the  artichokes. Toss with pasta. Can be served warm off the stove, or is even  better and more flavorful when chilled. Can also be tossed with FF Parmesan  cheese, (or fresh grated, if you can stand the fat.)
