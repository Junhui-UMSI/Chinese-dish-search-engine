Put washed tomatillas on a pan and cook for 15 min. Cool, then  throw all in the blender and blend until smooth.    While cooking tomatillas saute all the other stuff in the oil and water.  Pour the blended tomatillas into the pot with the vegys and simmer about  30min. The sauce can be left as is or put in the blended to make a smooth  sauce.
