(Cooking Light)    1. Combine the first 3 ingredients in a bowl, and set aside. Beat margarine  at medium speed of a mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually add sugar,  beating at medium speed of a mixer until well-blended. Add vanilla and egg  white, and beat well. Add flour mixture, and stir until well-blended. Turn  dough out onto wax paper, and shape into a 6-inch log. Wrap log in wax  paper, and freeze for 3 hours or until very firm.    2. Preheat oven to 350?.    3. Cut log into 24 (1/4-inch) slices, and place slices 1 inch apart on a  baking sheet coated with cooking spray. (For slicing, they recmmend either  using dental floss, or a sharp knife). Bake at 350? for 8 to 10 minutes.  Remove from pan, and cool on wire racks. Yield: 2 dozen (serving size: 1  cookie).    Variations: CHOCOLATE ICEBOX COOKIES: Reduce flour to 3/4 cup and add 1/4  cup unsweetened cocoa powder with the dry ingredients.    PEANUT BUTTER ICEBOX COOKIES: Reduce margarine to 3 Tablespoons, add 2TB  peanut butter, and change the 2/3 cup sugar to 1/2 cup brown sugar +      1/4    cup granulated sugar.    BROWN SUGAR ICEBOX COOKIES: Instead of the granulated sugar, use 2/3 cup  brown sugar.    LEMON-CORNMEAL ICEBOX COOKIES: Reduce flour to 3/4 cup and add 1/4 cup  yellow cornmeal with the dry ingredients. Also, increase the 2/3 cup  granulated sugar to 3/4 cup, and add 2 tsp grated lemon rind with the wet  ingredients.    There are even additional variations listed in the magazine under each of  the above categories which I wont include - but they all sound yummy! I  highly recommend this double issue - thumb through it at the store. I am  not affiliated with Cooking Light, Im just a happy subscriber.
