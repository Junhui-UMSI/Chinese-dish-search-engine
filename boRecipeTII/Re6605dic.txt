Pocket Soup - Goldbeck
Nutritional yeast, Salt, ;(soup greens), Dehydrated vegetable flakes, Split peas, dried, Cracked wheat, Sunflower seeds, Sesame seeds, 
Grind split peas, cracked wheat, vegetable flakes and seeds in blender  until they are a fine powder. Combine ground mixture with yeast and salt.  Store in a covered container at room temperature. To use, add 1 heaping  teaspoon soup mix to 6 ounces of boiling water, or 2 level teaspoons to 1  cup boiling water. Stir, let sit a few minutes, and serve. Makes 3/4 Cup  dried soup mix - enough for 18 cups of soup. Note: this is one of those  times when a blender seems to do a much more efficient job than the food  processor. Note 2: Those who enjoy an instant cup of broth but are dismayed  by the use of flavor enhancers and the abundance of salt in commercial  brands may welcome the chance to make their own soup mix.
