Process on "dough" cycle. The filling would be 1/2 cup  melted margarine or butter (I use 1/4 cup) topped with  1 cup brown sugar mixed with 3 TBS cinnamon. (I add  raisins and nuts.) The topping is 4 oz. cream cheese,  1/4 cup butter or margarine (I skip this) 1/2 tsp.  vanilla, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar and a teaspoon or  two of milk. Ive done these both "full fat" and  "reduced fat." Its hard to tell the difference, so we  go "reduced," including using light (Neufchatel) cream  cheese. Ive tried ALL the fat free cream cheeses and  NONE of them work. JUDITH PENZINER (GGMB18A)JUDITH  PENZINER (GGMB18A) Happy baking!                       Judy
