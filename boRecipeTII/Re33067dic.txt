Basic Deep-Fried Bean Curd
Cakes bean curd, Salt, Oil for deep-frying, 
1. Cut bean curd cakes in 1-inch cubes. Blot gently with paper toweling to  remove as much moisture as possible.    2. Heat oil and deep-fry bean curd cubes, several at a time, until puffed  up and golden. Drain on paper toweling. Sprinkle with salt and serve hot.    NOTE: Deep-fried bean curd cubes can be added to any stir-fried dish. They  should be added at the very end, only to heat through (so as not to lose  their interesting texture and crispness). Speared on toothpicks, these are  also excellent as an hors doeuvre to serve with cocktails. VARIATION: At  the end of step 2, also sprinkle lightly with hot sauce.
