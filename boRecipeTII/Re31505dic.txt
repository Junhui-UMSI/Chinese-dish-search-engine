Sweet-And-Sour Red Peppers
basil leaves, Fruity olive oil, Balsamic vinegar, Tomato paste, Red bell peppers, Salt, Garlic, 
SLICE THE PEPPER INTO STRIPS 2- to 3-inches long and about 1/4-inch  wide--or whatever width appeals to you. They can be very skinny, or nice  and wide, too. Heat oil in a large skillet with the garlic. When its hot,  add the peppers, sprinkled with salt, and stir so that all are coated with  the oil. Cook over a brisk heat, shaking the pan occasionally until the  peppers are hot and beginning to cook, about 5 minutes, then stir in the  tomato paste. When it is well incorporated, add the vinegar and stir.  Continue to saute until the vinegar is reduced and the peppers are as done  as you like. Theyre good when still somewhat firm--perfect for a little  salad--but they can also cook until they are very soft throughout-- good  with pasta or heaped on garlic- rubbed grilled bread. Toss in the basil,  season with pepper, and heap onto a serving plate.
