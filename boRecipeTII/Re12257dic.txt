Score the  flesh in 1 in. squares, cutting halfway through to the outer skin. Rub with  2 tbs. olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Set aside.    2.  To make the filling, heat 2 tbs. olive oil in a wide skillet.  Add the  onion and cook until soft, stirring.  Add the meat, breaking it apart with  a spoon, and cook over high heat until browned. Add the tomato sauce,  thyme, and salt and simmer 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from  heat and set aside. 3. Preheat oven to 325 F.    4.  Cover the bread with water; drain.  Using your hands, squeeze out as  much water as possible. Set aside.    5. Combine the meat sauce, bread, chard, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, eggs and  parsley.  Beat to blend. Mound the mixture into the zucchini half, patting  firmly in place.    6. Place the zucchini in a baking pan & add 1/2 in. water.  Bake uncovered    1-1/4    hour in preheated oven.    7. Transfer the zucchini to a cutting board.  Cut crosswise into serving  portions.  Serve with extra Parmesan cheese as topping. NOTE:  The zucchini  can be made ahead, covered and reheated in a 325 F oven 15 to 20 mins.
