Almond Toffee
toasted almonds, butter, Baking soda, Vanilla extract, chocolate, Brown sugar, Water, 
Lightly grease a 10 x 15-inch baking sheet. Set aside.    In a large heavy saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter, and water and  bring slowly to the boil, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Insert  a candy thermometer and cook until the mixture reaches 285 degrees F.~  (soft-crack stage). Remove from the heat and quickly stir in the vanilla  and baking soda. Immediately pour onto the greased baking sheet. Sprinkle  the chocolate chips over the hot toffee. Let sit for 5 minutes, then spread  evenly over the surface of the toffee with a spatula. Sprinkle the nuts  evenly over the top. Cool completely. Break the hardened toffee into pieces  and store in an airtight container.
