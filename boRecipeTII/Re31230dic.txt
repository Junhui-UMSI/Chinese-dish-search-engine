From: Sandal@aol.com    Date: Tue, 19 Sep 1995 20:41:56 -0400  I just made this and its quite good. Its inspired by Ben & Jerrys Chunky  Monkey, one of my favorite flavors, but the recipe is my own adaptation  after looking at banana ice cream recipes in several cookbooks. Let me know  what you think, sp that I can possibly refine it further.    Peel the bananas and cut into chunks. Puree in blender with the lemon  juice. Add vanilla and sugar and blend until smooth. Add milk and blend  again, briefly. Add cream, blend thoroughly.    Churn in ice-cream machine according to manufacturers instructions. A few  minutes before finished, add nuts and chocolate chips; continue churning.  Makes 1 generous quart.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
