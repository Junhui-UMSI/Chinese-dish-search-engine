Beef Tongue
Bay leaf, Raisins, Salt, Beef tongue, Vinegar, Sugar, Cornstarch, Pepper, 
Put the tongue into a pot with the bay leaf and cover with water. Bring to  a low boil and simmer for about 3 hours, skimming off any scum that may  rise to the top. Remove the tongue and skin it. Keep the tongue warm while  making the sauce.    Boil the water that the tongue was cooked in, reducing it to about 1 cup.  Add the vinegar and the sugar, and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add  the raisins, and taste the sauce, adjusting the sugar and vinegar. Dissolve  the cornstarch (or flour) in some water, bring the sauce to the boil, and  add the thickener.    Slice the tongue fairly thinly, and spoon some sauce over it to serve.    John Hobson Formatted by Elaine Radis; P* ID BGMB90B; Internet ID:  Auntie_E@Prodigy.com.
