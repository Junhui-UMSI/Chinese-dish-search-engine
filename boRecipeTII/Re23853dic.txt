In a medium-sized bowl, mix all the marinade ingredients  together and spread this evenly over each side of the steaks. Allow to sit  and marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Approximately 40  minutes before you are ready to cook, make a charcoal fire and, when the  coals are ash white, grill the steaks on each side for about 5-to-10  minutes, depending on their thickness and your taste.
