Heres tasty casserole recipe that I found in _Southern Living 1995 Annual  Recipes_. I tried this last night and it tasted fabulous!:) Plus its easy  to make and is composed mostly of common ingredients.    Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper; place in a 13x9x2 inch basking dish.  Bake at 325F for 20 minutes or until done; cool. Coarsely chop chicken, and  set aside.    Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped pepper and  onion, and cook, stirring mixture constantly, until vegetables are  crisp-tender. Remove from heat, and stir in chicken, tomatoes with green  chiles, and soups.    Place one-third of tortilla quarters in bottom of a lightly greased 13x9x2  inch baking dish;; top with one-third chicken mixture, and sprinkle evenly  with 2/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Repeat layers twice, reserving  remaining 2/3 cup cheese.    Bake at 325F for 35 minutes; sprinkle with reserved cheese, and bake 5  additional minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.    Yield: 6 to 8 servings.    Posted to Recipe Archive - 22 Sep 96    submitted by: bohemia@felix.TECLink.Net    Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 21:04:28 -0500 (CDT)
