Form into small balls about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size.  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Butter the bottom of a small glass and  dip into white sugar, then pound the cookies flat. Bake at 350 degrees for  about 10 to 12 minutes. This is a good recipe to use when you need to get  rid of some agressions because the dough is too heavy for most mixers. So  you have to use your hands and beat it!! You can also use peanut butter or  butterscotch chips or a mixture of them.
