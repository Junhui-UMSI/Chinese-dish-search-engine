Butter or margarine, mushrooms, Salt, Whipping cream, parsley, fresh, Lemon juice, All-purpose flour, dressed trout, 
In a wide frying pan, melt butter over medium-high heat; add  mushrooms and saute, stirring frequently, until golden and brown (about  5 minutes). Stir in parsley, then remove pan from heat and lift  mushrooms from pan with slotted spoon.  Arrange evenly to cover bottom  of a large warm serving platter; keep warm.  Set pan aside.    Wipe fish with damp cloth, inside cavities and outside.  Coat fish  with flour; shake off excess.  Arrange in single layer on wax paper  within reaching distance of range.  Return pan to medium heat; add salt  to remaining butter.    Place in pan as many fish as will fit without crowding.  Cook,  turning once, until fish is lightly browned and flakes readily when  prodded with a fork.  For a 1-inch fish allow 10 minutes total - 5  minutes on each side.    When fish is done, remove from pan and arrange on top of mushrooms;  keep warm. Repeat process with remaining fish.    After removing last fish, add lemon juice and cream to pan; bring to  a boil, stirring and scraping to blend with pan drippings.  Spoon  immediately over fish and mushrooms and serve.
