Avocados with Honey
Honey to taste, Avocados, 
Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pit. Scoop the flesh  from the avocado, leaving the shell intact. Place the avocado meat in a  bowl and sweeten it with honey to taste. Replace the sweetened avocado in  the shells, cover them with plastic wrap and chill them. Serve them cold on  a bed of lettuce or on a bed of avocado leaves, if you can find them.
