Tarragon Chicken and Potatoes
Onion (large), Dried tarragon leaves, Chicken (no. 2, cut or, Water, Turmeric, Clear chicken instant soup, Potatoes (according to, 
slice onion into strips and line the bottom of a pot. add taragon leaves  and soup mix (powder). Add 1 cup water and start to boil. Add chicken and  sliced potatoes to pot, sprinkle turmeric on top (about 2 tsp.). Add 2-3  cups of water and bring to boil. cover pot and reduce heat. Cook until done  approx. 45 min.    note: The amount of chicken/potatoes differs according to the family  appetite. My rule of thumb is 1.5 med. potatoes per person and 2 for  "hungry member" of the family.    ps. if you added a lot of water, the stock can be used as a base for a  soup.
