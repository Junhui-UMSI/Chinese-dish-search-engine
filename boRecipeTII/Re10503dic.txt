GARLIC-ONION SOUP:  Peel and mince the garlic.  Peel and thinly slice the  onions (food processor preferred). Heat the butter in a large, deep  skillet. Add garlic and onions; cover and cook over medium heat, stirring  occasionally, until onions soften, about 8 minutes. Uncover and saute until  golden, about 5 minutes longer. Add thyme, salt, pepper, and chicken stock.  Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer to blend flavors, about 5  minutes.    RED-WINE CROUTONS:  Cut the bread on the diagonal into four 1-inch thick  slices.  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet. Add the bread  and saute on both sides until light brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle the  wine and remaining oil over the croutons and top them with the cheese  slices.  Cover and cook over medium heat until the cheese melts, 2 to 3  minutes.    SERVING:  Ladle soup into warm soup bowls and top with the croutons. Pass  the Parmesan cheese separately.                                  [Cooks magazine; April 1989]                                Posted by Fred Peters 				Fidonet COOKING  echo
