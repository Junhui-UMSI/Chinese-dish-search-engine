Brought this to our Havurah group and it was really good. Enjoy!1. Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir in  the rice and bring back to a boil. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer 18 minutes.  Set aside.2. Saute the onion, jalapenos, and peppers in olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until just soft. Sprinkle with sugar and stir in well. Set  aside.3. Stir together the cooked barley, raisins, rice and onion-pepper mixture in a large mixing bowl. Drain the artichokes and save the liquid. Stir the drained artichokes into the mixture. In a small mixing bowl, stir together  the artichoke liquid, mayonnaise , curry powder, chili oil, and ginger.  Stir the mayonnaise mixture into rice-barley mixture and refrigerate for several hours or overnight for flavors to meld. Serve cold. Spoon onto a  large serving platter. Sprinkle with coconut, peanuts and scallions and  serve.    Variation: Cooked boneless chicken can be added.    I used Chicken Flavored Broth Mix (containing no meat), brown Basmati rice,  salted, roasted Cashew nuts, and about 2 T. curry powder and some salt.
