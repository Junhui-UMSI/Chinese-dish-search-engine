Other possible additions (not combined, of course):  : a tablespoon of tomato paste  : 1/2 cup of leftover beans or grains  : a few dried mushrooms or dried tomatoes  : a few tablespoons of sauerkraut  : a tablespoon of capers or chopped pickle added before serving  : a tablespoon of yogurt swirled in right before serving (pretty!)  : toasted pumpkin/squash seeds or wheat germ sprinkled on top  Recipe by: Net    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #041 by Annice Grinberg  <VSANNICE@WEIZMANN.WEIZMANN.AC.IL> on Feb 06, 97.
