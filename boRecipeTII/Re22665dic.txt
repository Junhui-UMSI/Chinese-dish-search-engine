Dont be fooled by the simplicity of this recipe!    Mix together (with bare hands is fun).  If its too runny add some crushed  biscuits.  Roll into a snake and dust lightly in either castor sugar or  more coconut. Chop into 1cm thick pieces. Eat the rest of the condensed  milk (straight out of the tin) while the apricot delight is chilled in the  fridge.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
