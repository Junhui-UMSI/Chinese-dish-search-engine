Warm Lemon Pudding Cakes with Marbled Raspberry Cream
Eggs, Lemon peel, Unsalted butter, Milk, Sugar, Whipping cream, Sugar, Frozen raspberries in syrup, Fresh Lemon Juice, All purpose flour, Powdered sugar, MARBLED RASPBERRY CREAM, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Butter six 3/4-cup souffle dishes or custard cups.  Place dishes in large roasting pan. Using electric mixer, beat 3/4 cup plus  2 tablespoons sugar, 6 tablespoons butter and lemon peel in medium bowl  until well blended. Add egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each  addition. Beat in flour, then lemon juice. Gradually mix in milk (mixture  will be thin and may look curdled).    Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in large bowl until soft peaks  form. Add remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry.  Fold whites into yolk mixture in 3 additions (mixture will be runny).    Divide pudding-cake mixture among prepared souffle dishes. Pour enough hot  water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of dishes.    Bake pudding cakes until puffed and firm to touch, about 25 minutes.  Transfer dishes to plates. (Can be prepared 8 hours ahead. Let stand at  room temperature.) Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Top with dollop of Marbled  Raspberry Cream.    Marbled Raspberry Cream: Puree raspberries in syrup in processor. Stain  puree; discard seeds. Beat whipping cream and sugar in medium bowl until  stiff peaks form. Drizzle raspberry puree over cream. Using knife, swirl  raspberry puree into cream just until marbled in appearance. (Can be  prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.)    Chefs Note: These elegant cakes have a soft pudding-like center and  refreshing lemon flavor. Although best served warm, they can be made ahead  and served at room temperature.    Tarla Fallgatter has been teaching cooking classes for more than 15 years.
