Lightly sprinkle into each tomato a little sugar, salt, pepper and  oregano; place four cubes of mozzarella in each tomato.    Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the onion in it until soft; stir in  the orzo, stirring well so each grain of pasta is coated. pour in 2 cups of  the stock, stir well, and simmer until it is absorbed, adding more stock  gradually until the orzo is about three quarters cooked; firmer than al  dente. Bled in the Parmesan, stirring it in well.    Spoon the orzo mixture into the hollowed tomatoes, filling them. Place the  filled tomatoes in a casserole or baking dish with 1/2 cup of hot stock in  the bottom of the dish.
