Alfred Portales Jumbo Asparagus Salad with Prosciuttode Parma, Parmesan,  and Lemon Vinaigrette    1. For the vinaigrette, mix lemon juice, zest, vinegar, and salt and pepper  to taste in a medium bowl. Whisk in olive oil and set aside.    2. Bring 1 inch water to boil in a soup kettle. Put asparagus in steamer  basket then carefully place steamer basket in kettle and cover and steam  over medium-high heat until asparagus spears bend slightly when picked up  and flesh at cut end yields when squeezed, 4 to 5 minutes for asparagus  under 1/2 inch in diameter, 5 to 6 minutes for the jumbo size. Drain and  plunge spears immediately into ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain  again, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, as long as overnight.    3. In a medium bowl, combine the shallots, thyme, asparagus, sliced  potatoes, and 1 tablespoon chives. Add 1/4 cup vinaigrette toss to coat.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.    4. Arrange asparagus-potato mixture with the prosciutto alongside it on 4  large serving plates. Dress lettuces with another 1/4 cup vinaigrette, and  arrange a portion on each plate. Use a vegetable peeler to shave Parmesan  curls over each salad. Press eggs through a fine sieve. Sprinkle each salad  with sieved egg and remaining chives-, serve immediately with remaining  dressing passed separately.    Cooks Illustrated, May/June 1993, Page 7. Credit: Stephanie Lyness.
