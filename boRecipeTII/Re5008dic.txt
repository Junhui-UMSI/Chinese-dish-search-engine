SERVES 12 AS AN APPETIZER      This dish is a regular and beloved treat in the Northwest. The background  of the recipe is more Scandinavian or Jewish than it is Northwest Indian.  The Indians would often dry or smoke salmon, but this method of  preservation is popular throughout the area.      One thing to remember: Solly, my friend at the Pure Food Fish Company in  the Pike Place Farmers Market in Seattle, has taught me an interesting  fact about salmon. The fat is found in the skin and next to the bones.  Since it is fat that gives a rancid flavor to the fish, you must be careful  to remove both the fat and the bones if you are to have a truly  sweet-tasting pickled salmon.      Sprinkle the salmon on both sides with the salt. Rub it in a bit. Cover  and refrigerate overnight.      Wash the salt from the salmon and place in a solution of vinegar and  brown sugar. Cover and refrigerate for 3 days. Then, add the remaining  ingredients, cover, and return to the refrigerator for an additional 3  days.      Slice salmon thin, across the grain, before serving.      This is great as a first course or appetizer served on thin-sliced dark  bread or on rye crackers.    REQUIRES 6 DAYS TO MARINATE    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
