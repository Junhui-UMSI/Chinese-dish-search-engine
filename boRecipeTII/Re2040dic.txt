Marinade: The night before you plan on slow cooking your dinner, mix  together the marinade ingredients in a container large enough to also hold  the chicken pieces. When marinade is thoroughly mixed, add the chicken,  close container and refrigerate until morning.    In the morning place the chicken in the slow cooker and add marinade not  fill above an inch from the top of the container.    Set the cooker on low and cover. Then, 6 to 8 hours later, turn the cooker  to high for 45 to 60 minutes. Add the mushrooms, fresh herb, a few  grindings of salt and pepper, mandarin sections with juice (not syrup), if  desired, green pepper strips and ginger stir thoroughly and cook for about  5 to 10 minutes. Add the dissolved cornstarch and stir; re-cover, ajar, and  simmer for 15 to 30 minutes while preparing the side dishes. Remove from  heat and add yogurt to cream the sauce, optional. Serve with vegetable  medley and small new potatoes or steamed jasmine rice. Serves 6: 380 cals,        7 g  fat (17% cff).    *INFO* recipe from All About Food by Ruth Burkhardt  http://www.enter.net/~rburk/ Revised by Pat Hanneman. Skin removed from  chicken and replaced with butter buds or olive oil for flavor. Fresh ginger  replaces ground. Mushroom slices added directly rather than sauted. Add  fresh herb to boost flavor: thyme, marjoram, cilantro, parsley, oregano,  tarragon, or chives. Yogurt replaces milk as creamer. TIP: To get a thicker  sauce, remove chicken to a serving bowl tranfer liquids to a saucepan and  thicken on the stove top with more dissolved cornstarch.
