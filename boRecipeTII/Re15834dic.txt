Academy Dark Truffles
Softened unsweetened butter, Cocoa powder, Orange liqueur, Bittersweet chocolate, Heavy cream, Melted white chocolate; optional, Vanilla extract, Parchment paper, Almond liqueur, 
Shave chocolate into tiny pieces; set aside. In a large saucepan,  blend together cream, liqueurs and vanilla and heat until the cream  begins to scald; remove from heat. Add the chocolate pieces and whisk  for 2 to 3 minutes or until the ganache is satiny and smooth, with no  lumps of cream or chocolate. Transfer ganache to a bowl and allow to  cool (at room temperature) below 90 degrees. Cut butter into small  pieces and add, piece by piece, to the ganache, stirring well. Allow  ganache to cool and become somewhat firm. Line a baking pan with  parchment paper. Using a SMALL ice cream scoop, shape ganache into  mounds and place them on the parchment. Refrigerate until set. Dust  hands with cocoa powder; shape each mound into uniformly-shaped balls  and refrigerate.    Melt chocolate in a double boiler. Arrange two sheets of parchment  paper on work surface. Drop a truffle into melted chocolate, retrieve  with fork and tap the truffle 4 or 5 times against the surface of the  chocolate to get rid of the excess. Then scrape the sides of the pan  with the fork and drag the fork (with the truffle on it) across one  sheet of parchment paper to remove more chocolate. Place the finished  truffle on the clean parchment; repeat with remaining truffles. If  desired, use melted white chocolate to pipe designs onto tops of  truffles.
