Libby Goldstein <libby@igc.apc.org>    Chill a large metal mixing bowl in the freezer or fridge.    Seed the chile and crush it in a mortar and pestle or puree it in a food  processor.    In a 2-quart heavy sauce pan over very low heat melt the chocolate with the  coffee, rum, crushed chile and butter stirring from time to time. When the  chocolate and butter are melted and the mixture is shiny and smooth remove  from heat and whisk in the cream. Stir til smooth and set aside.    In the chilled bowl, beat the eggs with an electric beater set on highest  speed until they are pale and creamy colored; add the sugar a little at a  time beating all the while. When all the sugar is beaten in, beat the  mixture until it is very thick and creamy -- 2-3 min. Beat in the 1 1/2  cups cream, and continue beating until well combined. (You can do all this  with a whisk, but a hand held electric mixer is faster and easier.) Beat in  the chocolate mixture, stopping once in a while to scrape down the sides of  the bowl, until the mixture is completely combined.    Chill the mixture for at least 1/2 hour. Freeze according to your ice cream  freezers directions .    For a totally different "hot" chocolate flavor, omit the chile and add 1/4  to 1/2 cup crystalized ginger cut into 1/4" hunks to the mixture before  chilling.
