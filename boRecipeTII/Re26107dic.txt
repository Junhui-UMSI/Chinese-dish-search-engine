Black sesame seeds, TOPPING, Garlic, Soy sauce, Vegetable oil, Tofu blocks, zha-cai, 
By: Junko Lampert, The Tofu Cookbook (Japan)    Method: Wrap each piece of tofu in a dry cloth, drain for 4-5 hours on a  slanted cutting board. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan; then mince. Mix  the garlic and soy sauce. Heat the oil. Slip in the tofu and cook over high  heat for several minutes; then reduce the heat. With chopsticks, stab many  holes in the cakes of tofu, slowly pour 2/3 of the garlic-soy sauce mixture  over tofu, letting it sink into the holes. When the bottom of the tofu is  nicely brown, turn, pour on the remainder of the garlic-soy sauce, and cook  for a few more minutes. Place on a plate with the side that was browned  first (darkest) on top. Spread the topping over the tofu cakes; centered.  Arrange plate. Serve with watercress, steamed carrot slices (blossom-cut)  and about 8 to 10 pea pods, also steamed, and arranged in fan, or stacked  in two fans. CooksPantry ... Zha-Cai is a pickled Chinese vegetable  resembling kohlrabi. You may also find it spelled "cha Tsoi" or "Choan  choy." It is variously translatted into English as pickled or preserved  cabbage, mustard greens, kohlrabi, or winter vetetable. Refrigerate what  you dont use in the recipe in this book; it will stay fresh for a long  time. You can use it to add interesting flavor to western soups and stews.  It is coarsely chopped.    You might substitute chopped shiitake (mushrooms) and nappa cabbage in a  ginger-pepper vinaigrette. Junko Lampert, The Tofu Cookbook: Recipes for  Traditional and Modern Cooking.
