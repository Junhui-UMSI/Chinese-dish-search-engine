Hi, all. Im catching up on back digests and saw a recent interest in  rutabagas. I found a great recipe in the January/97 issue of Vegetarian  Times (page 49).    Note: Roots get sweeter when theyre cooked slowly.    Preheat oven to 350. PAM a 2 qt. casserole dish (if necessary). Arrange  veggies in dish. In small bowl combine sherry or broth, apple juice  concentrate, honey or brown sugar, and lemon rind. Drizzle over root  veggies. Cover with aluminum foil and bake till tender, about 40-50  minutes. Makes 4 servings (80 cal. each).    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #299 by "Neil C. Andrews, MD"  <ncandrews@ucdavis.edu> on Dec 18, 1997
