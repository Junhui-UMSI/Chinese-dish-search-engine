In a food processor, puree the pecans until smooth. Add enough flour to  bind the pecans and form a crust, about 1/2 cup. Season the crust with  Essence. Season the remaining flour with Essence. Season both sides of  Mozzarella cheese with salt and pepper. Dredge each slice of cheese in the  flour. Dip each slice in the egg wash, removing any excess. Dredge the  slices in the pecan crust, covering the entire slice completely.    Set the cheese aside. In a sauce pan, heat a tablespoon of the olive oil.  When the oil is hot, saut_ the onions until they caramelize, about 8  minutes. Add the shallots and garlic. Whisk in the olive oil and vinegar.  Stir in the honey to taste. Bring the dressing up to a simmer. Season with  salt and black pepper. In a saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil. When  the oil is hot, pan-fry the cheese for 1-2 minutes on each side or until  the crust is golden.    Remove from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with Essence.  Toss the spinach with the dressing and mound in the center of the plate.  Arrange the cheese around the greens. Garnish with black pepper around the  rim.
