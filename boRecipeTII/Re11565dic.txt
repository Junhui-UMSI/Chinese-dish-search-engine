Raspberry Jam
Raspberries, Fresh Lemon Juice, Sugar, Homemade pectin, 
Pick over the raspberries for any leaves or unusable fruit. There should be  3 packed quarts.  Combine with the sugar in a large bowl and let stand at  room temperature for 6 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Stir  occasionally. Stir together the raspberry mixture, pectin, and lemon juice  in a large shallow nonreactive preserving pan and place over high heat.  Bring to a full boil, skimm off foam, then lower heat to medium. Stir often  so the bottom does not burn. When the jam is sufficiently thickened, the  bubbles on top will become smaller and the jam will look like bubbling tar.  This takes approximately 20 minutes, depending on the size of the pan. If  the jam is still too liquid, continue cooking for 5 minutes more and test  again. Turn off the heat and remove a tablespoon of jam to a small plate to  test.   Chill in the freezer for 5 minutes.  If the jam is the consistency  desired, turn the heat to low while ladling the jam into hot sterilized  jars.  Wipe rims clean with a damp towel. Seal with new lids and metal  rings.  Process in a hot-water bath for 5 minutes. Remove, cool, check  seals, label, and store.
