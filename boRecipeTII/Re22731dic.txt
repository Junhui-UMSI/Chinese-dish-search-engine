Soak the apricots in the apple juice for 10 minutes.  Combine the  flour, baking powder, baking soda, spice and walnuts in a bowl.  Beat  together the oil, sugar, and egg.  Add the apricots, with the juice  and egg mixture to the flour.    Mix just until all the ingredients are blended.  Spoon into oiled  muffin tins or (my choice) paper muffin cups (sprayed with non-stick  spray). Fill cups 3/4 full.  Bake in 350 F oven for 10 to 15 minutes,  or until golden brown.    1 muffin - 182 calories, 1 bread exchange, 1/2 fruit, 2 fat 22 grams  carbohydrate, 4 grams protein, 10 grams fat 97 mg sodium, 166 mg  potassium, 34 mg cholesterol    Source:  Am.

Leave out walnuts to reduce the fat and use 2 egg whites  instead of the whole egg to reduce cholesterol if desired.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/diabetic.zip
