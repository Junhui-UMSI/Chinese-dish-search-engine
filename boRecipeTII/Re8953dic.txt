Pressure Cooked Pinto Beans
Water, Pinto beans, Vegetable oil, 
Pick over beans, rinse and drain. Be sure to not fill the pressure cooker  above the halfway mark. Combine ingredients in the cooker and cook for 22  to 25 minutes. For firm cooked beans, check for doneness after minimum time  indicated. For soft cooked beans, add 2 extra minutes under high pressure.  When cooking time is up, quick release pressure by placing cooker under  cold running water. Drain immediately. Always clean the lid and vent  thoroughly after cooking beans.    Optional presoak: Cook the beans under high pressure for 1 minute, using 4  cups of water per cup of dried beans. Quick release the pressure under cold  running water, drain and rinse the beans. Always discard any loose or free  floating bean skins before further cooking. Follow cooking instructions  above but adjust cooking time to 7 to 10 minutes.    Note: Add 3 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of oil for each additional cup  of beans.    Yield: 2 cups cooked beans    Notes: Recipe courtesy of Lorna Sass, author of Cooking Under Pressure    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9071    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Apr 4, 1998
