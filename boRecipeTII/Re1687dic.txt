Cauliflower Soup
Water, Cauliflower; chopped, Sliced carrots, Onions, Chopped parsley, Chicken bouillon cube, Salt, White pepper; to taste, 
1. In a 5-quart (or 5-L) saucepan, add all ingredients except salt and  white pepper. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender (about 20  minutes).    2. Strain off and reserve most of the liquid. Place vegetables in a food  processor and puree.    3. Add pureed vegetables and reserved liquid back into the pot, add salt  and white pepper, and reheat.    NOTES : The recipe on Recipes Archive 14 used half the ingredients and made  about 1 quart (Litre). The soup was fairly thin. I may try increasing the  vegetable content and decreasing the water volume slightly. The carrots  make the soup look orange, unlike the usual near-white of typical  cauliflower soups.
