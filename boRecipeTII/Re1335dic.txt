Dutch Split Pea Soup (Snert)
Split peas, Stock cubes, Chicken breasts, Meatloaf, Vegatables for soup, Some pepper, If you like it an onion, 
Put the peas in a pan, pour water on it and let it rest over night. the  peas will be swollen the next morning. Use the water in the pan and add  some more. You can use a big pan and fill it for 3/4 with (cold) water. Put  the pan on the stove, and let it heat up slowly on a low fire. Add the  chicken breast, which are chopped. I dont know how many stock cubes have  to be used, that depends how much salt you like in soup. make little balls  of the meatloaf and add that too. (we here in Holland have minced beef).  Let the soup boil for one hour on a low fire. Stir now and then. When the  soup looks like a green smoothly porridge, add the vegatables and let it  boil another 10 min. Dont forget to stir. It esasy burns on the bottom.  You can add a chopped onion too, and if you like it some pepper.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Coby Andel en Han Mauwer"  <hanmauwer@wxs.nl> on Oct 16, 1998,
