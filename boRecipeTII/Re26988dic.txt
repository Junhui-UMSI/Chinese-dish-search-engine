Three Grain Pancakes
milk, Eggs, Butter, Baking soda, Sugar, Baking Powder, All purpose flour, Whole wheat flour, Salt, Maple Syrup; Warmed, Stone Ground Cornmeal, Rye flour, 
Melt the butter in a (1 Qt) saucepan. Set aside to cool. Combine the milk  and eggs in a small bowl. Mix the flours with the cornmeal, sugar, baking  powder, salt and baking soda in a medium size bowl. Stir the milk mixture  into the flour mixture just until they are well mixed. Stir in the melted  butter. The batter should be slightly lumpy. Let the batter rest for 30  minutes. Lightly oil the griddle or large skillet. Heat over medium high  heat until a drop of water dances across the surface. Stir the batter. Drop  a test cake ( 1/4 cup of batter). Cook until bubbles begin to burst on the  top surface and the bottom is light brown. Turn and cook the other side  until it is browned (1-2 minutes). Add more milk to the batter if the first  cake does not spread well. Serve the pancakes with warm syrup.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Joel Ehrlich <Joel.Ehrlich@SALATA.COM> on Dec  29, 1997
