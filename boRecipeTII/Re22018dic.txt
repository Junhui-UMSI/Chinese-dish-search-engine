Turkey Cotolette Alla Romagnola
Fresh bread crumbs, Turkey cutlets;1/2" thick,, Eggs, Basic tomato sauce, Prosciutto di Parma; paper, Virgin olive oil, Unsalted butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano; shaved, Chicken Stock, 
Season turkey pieces with salt and pepper and place in egg mixture. Drain  to remove excess and dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to coat each one  evenly. Lay on plate and refrigerate 1 hour.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.    In a 14 to 16inch saute pan (large enough to hold all 4 turkey pieces at  the same time) over medium heat, heat oil and butter until foam from butter  dissipates. Place turkey pieces in pan and cook slowly until golden brown  on one side, about 6 to 7 minutes. DO NOT RUSH THIS STEP OR THEY WILL BURN.  Turn and cook the other side. When both sides are golden brown, pour tomato  sauce and chicken stock around meat and bring to a boil. Place 1 slice  Prosciutto over each piece and sprinkle with shaved Parmesan and place  uncovered in oven for 10 minutes. Remove and place in warmed serving  platter. Drizzle with spoonfuls of sauce and serve.    Yield: 4 servings    Recipe by: MOLTO MARIO #MB5728 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #743 by Sue  <suechef@sover.net> on Aug 14, 1997
