Mash  grains  in 1-2 gallons of water. Sparge with enough water  to  end  with  2-3  gallons in pot. Bring to boil. Stir in extract and  bring  to  boil. Add boiling hops. Boil 40 minutes. Add Irish moss in last 15  min-  utes.  At  end of boil, add aromatic hops and steep 15  minutes.  Sparge  into primary with enough water to make 6 gallons. Cool and pitch  yeast.  Rack to secondary when initial blow off subsides. Prime and bottle about a  month later. This brew is so dark I think the Irish moss may be  superfluous. This was the most active brew Ive had in a while. Expect to  use some  sort  of blow off method for primary and then rack to secondary  with an airlock. Very black! Thick, but not as much as Guinness. Well  rounded flavor  and smooth with almost no bite. Very dark head. Maybe using  less roast  bar- ley and a bit more black patent would lighten the head and  keep the body from suffering. Everybody who tasted it really like it. I do  believe Ive found my house stout.
