~ from Betty Crocker International Cookbook    Pre-heat oven to 425 F.  Spray or lightly grease a 9" X 12" (or whatever)  pan.  Brown beef and drain, add sour cream, green peppers, chili powder,  cumin, 1 cup cheese and onions.  Cook so all combines and cheese melts.  Heat enchiladas ( I open bag and nuke for 30 seconds and flip package over  and nuke for another 20 sec. )  Place 1-2 T of mixture on enchilada and  roll-up.  Place side by side in pan, cover with sauce and remaining cheese.  Cook for 30 minutes or till bubbly.
