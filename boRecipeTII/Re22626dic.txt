Preparation:  1- Mix Preserves, Dressing, and Onion mix 2- Arrange chicken in a baking  dish; pour mix over chicken; 3- Marinade 3+ hours, refrigerated. 4- Bake at  325F-350F 45 min to 1 hour, until juices clear. 5- To crisp chicken, cook  the last 15 min under the broiler. 6- Prepare rice with parsley; serve  chicken over rice. 7- My preference is to bake chicken about 30 min and  finish over a med-high grill, basting with some of the sauce and saving  some to pour over chicken and rice at serving.
