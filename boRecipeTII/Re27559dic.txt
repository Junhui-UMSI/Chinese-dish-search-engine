Believe it or not, this pizza is ready in half an hour. PREHEAT OVEN TO  500F.    (MIXING AND KNEADING: 1 1/2 MINUTES.) Place the yeast and 1 cup of the  flour in the bowl of a food processor and pulse once using the metal knife  or the plastic dough blade. With the machine running, pour in the hot water  (make certain its hot when you use it). As soon as its in, turn the  machine off; add the salt and remaining 2 cups of flour. Next, pulse until  the dough begins to hold together; then let the machine run continously  until a ball of dough forms.    (ASSEMBLY: 5 MINUTES.) Lightly oil the pan with vegetable oil and dust with  coarsely ground yellow cornmeal. Press the dough out into an 8-inch circle  with your fingertips and then roll or stretch it out into a 15-or-18-inch  pizza shell. Fit the shell onto prepared pan. Sprinkle desired toppings  over dough, and finish with a drizzling of olive oil. Bake 15 minutes or  until the crust is golden and the topping is bubbly. For a well-done crust  bake 5 minutes longer.
