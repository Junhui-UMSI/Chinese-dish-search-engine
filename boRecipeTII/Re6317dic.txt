Microwave chicken breasts in covered Corning Ware dish until done, about 17  minutes, turning dish once during cooking. Cool in cold water. Remove skin  and bones. Chop chicken. Saute chicken, garlic, onion and red bell pepper  in 2 tablespoons Caesar salad dressing until vegies are tender. Spray pizza  stone with non-stick cooking spray. Roll (I use my hands) out pizza dough  to cover stone and create ridge around the edge. Brush pizza dough lightly  with salad dressing. Spread chicken and vegies on dough. Top with  mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Bake at 350 ? for 20 - 25 minutes until  cheese is bubbly and crust is golden. While pizza is baking, chop lettuce  and tomato and toss with salad dressing to taste. When pizza comes out of  oven, place salad on top of pizza and garnish with coutons. Cut with pizza  cutter and serve!    Recipe by: Planet Hollywood Posted to EAT-L Digest 17 Mar 97 by Mac  <w.ma.chandler@WORLDNET.ATT.NET> on Mar 18, 1997
