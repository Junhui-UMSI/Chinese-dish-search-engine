Aussie Shrimp on the Barbie with Orange Ginger Sauce
Orange juice, Butter, Ginger root, Orange Zest, Prawns, Sherry, Green onions, 
Soak a dozen long wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes. Then push skewers  through prawns, lengthwise, from head to tail with only 1 to a skewer.    Combine all ingredients in saucepan and cook over medium to low heat,  stirring, until butter is completely melted.    Dip skewered prawns in the orange sauce and position on oiled grill rack  about 4 inches above the coals. Baste liberally with sauce and grill for 2  minutes. Turn the prawn over and baste again, cooking for another 2  minutes. Smaller prawn will be done at this point, but continue basting and  turning larger prawn until they are pink and cooked through. Remove from  heat immediately when done, as they will get tough of overcooked. Use any  remaining sauce for a dip for the prawns.
