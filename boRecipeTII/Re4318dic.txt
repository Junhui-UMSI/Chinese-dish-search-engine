Persimmon Brandy Conserve
Brandy, persimmons, Orange juice, Sugar, 
Fill a steamer or large pot with ripe persimmons & heat very gently or  steam for 1/2 hour until fruit is pulpy. Press the pulp through a  strainer & measure the volume. For every 2 quarts of persimmon pulp  add 1/2 pint orange juice & 1 1/2 quarts sugar. Pour the mixture into  a heavy pan or jelly pan & simmer uncovered for 1/2 hour, stirring  every 10 minutes. When the mixture begins to thicken remove from the  heat. Stir in 1/4 cup brandy for each quart of marmalade. Pour into  sterile jars & seal. Cool before storing.
