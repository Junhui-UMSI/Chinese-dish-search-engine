from the Union Square Cafe Cookbook, HarperCollins, 1994    These nuts won The New York Press award for "best bar nuts in New York."  Every afternoon at about 4:45, a piping hot batch emerges from our ovens  and is sent out to the bar, where the sweet rosemary fragrance wafts  throughout the restaurant. Though we dont have a television set at our  bar, these nuts would probably be a hit in your living room accompanied by  a football game and some ice-cold beer.    Yields 5 cups    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.    2. Toss the nuts in a large bowl to combine and spread them out on a cookie  sheet. Toast in the oven until they become light golden brown, about 10  minutes.    3. In the large bowl, combine the rosemary, cayenne, brown sugar, salt, and  melted butter.    4. Thoroughly toss the warm toasted nuts with the spiced butter and serve  warm.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 660 by Kelly Burleson  <kelly@hci.net> on Jan 31, 1998
