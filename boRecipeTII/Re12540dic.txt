The secret to Yerushalmi kugel is both the caramelized brown sugar and a  peppery taste. Heres my recipe (very easy), just watch the brown sugar  carefully, as it can burn really quickly.    Source: Aunt Baila    Preheat oven to 425* Boil 4 1/2 cups water, throw in 16 ounces thin noddles  (do not drain!) Add margarine, salt, sugar and pepper.    In a seperate pot, Caramelize oil & brown sugar. To caramelize: mix  ingredients together, place over a low flame. Watch constantly and stir  occasionally. When mixture bubbles and foams its ready(usually about 15  minutes or so).    Beat 2 eggs and add to noodle mixture. Then add caramerlized sugar. Place  in a greased bunt pan and bake for 50 -60 minutes.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Aliza Blizinsky" <alizab@hotmail.com> on  May 05, 1998
