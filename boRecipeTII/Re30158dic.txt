Peel the bananas and  slice them on the diagonal into 1/4 inch rounds. Arrange them in a circle  around the pomegranate cells.  Sprinkle with the lime or lemon juice,  sweetener and salt, and serve immediately.    >From The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking by Yamuna Devi  Posted to Recipe Archive - 24 November 96    Date: Sun, 24 Nov 96 7:21:04 EST    submitted by: eep@tampa.mindspring.com
