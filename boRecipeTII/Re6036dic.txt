Put in a preheated oven and cook  for half the time it takes to be ready.  Take the pan out and spread  ricotta and pepper. Finish cooking. If you have a special pizza oven you  can spread all the ingredients before cooking, as it takes much less time  to cook the pizza and the cheese doesnt get "burned".
