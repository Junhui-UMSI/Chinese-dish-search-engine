submitted by: edmon@cc.xu.edu.ph  I was requested to submit this recipe here. This is a very common Filipino  dish and very practical for tropical countries because of the lack of  electricity and appliances in villages and it can keep for days without  refrigeration. This dish however has become one of the Philippine favorites  even in cities and towns.    Combine all ingredients in a caserole and bring to a boil. Bring heat to  medium and simmer until meat is very tender. Some would transfer the dish  to a wok and fry the dish in its own oil until the pork and chicken are  shredded. Serve with rice. Most families do this purely with pork. For  variation it is also good to include chicken slices. This they call  Chicken-Pork Adobo.    ED MONTALVAN, P.O.
