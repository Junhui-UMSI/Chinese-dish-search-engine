Stuffed Eggplant Dinner
Parsley, Onion; diced, Tomato; cut in wedges, Bread, Oregano, Parmesan cheese, Garlic powder, Egg, Green olives; optional, Hamburger, salt and pepper, Eggplant, 
Cut eggplant in half lengthwise, hollow out meat. Dice eggplant but leave  shells intact. Fry onion & hamburger until light brown; add eggplant &  tomato & cook until soft but not mushy. Crumble bread into bowl & season  with spices to taste as well as the cheese. Combine dry ingredients & add 1  egg & some water if too dry. Combine all with hamburger mixture, add green  olives if desired. Place mixture into eggplant shells; top with additional  Parmesan cheese; bake at 350 for 40 minutes. Serves 2 as main dish; omit  hamburger for use as side dish. Shell will soften quicker if baked covered.  Remove cover before end of cooking so top will be crispy.    CPT R. W.
