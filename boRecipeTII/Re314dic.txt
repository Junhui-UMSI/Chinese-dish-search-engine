Leeky Crockpot
Medium red or white potatos, Cream of mushroom soup, Water, Chopped mushrooms, Blue lake green beans, whole, Tabasco sauce or other hot, White pepper (black ok), Leek bunches, washed and cut, 
Chop all veggies roughly and add to crockpot.  Now add all the cans, using  the liquid from the green beans for the can of water and adding more to  make a full can.  (May use fresh green beans and its better that way). Add  the mushrooms (consider using shiitake or morels if feeling fancy but plain  will do).  Add the rest and mix, then set on low for 6 hours.  Its ready  but will keep on low for another 12 hours cooking time easily. Refridgerate  liner at night.  Freezes pretty well in a sealed container.    From:  xxcarol    Optional low-fat version, change soup to low-fat chicken broth and add a  fistful of dry large lima beans (otherwise known as butter beans).
