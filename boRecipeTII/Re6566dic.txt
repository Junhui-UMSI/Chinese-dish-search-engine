Put salmon in baking dish, thick  sides to edge.  Cover tightly and microwave at high 2 min. Turn baking dish  1/2 turn and microwave 2-3 min more until small ends of steaks flake  easily.  Let stand covered 3 min, then serve with sauce.    Source:  Margo Olivers Cookbook for Seniors, Nutritious recipes for 1-2-or  more.  Shared & tested (stove top) by Elizabeth Rodier July 1993.
