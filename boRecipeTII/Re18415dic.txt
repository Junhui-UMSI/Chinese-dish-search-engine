Vichyssoise #2
Salt to taste, White pepper to taste, Onion; finely sliced, Cream, Chives, milk, Unsalted butter, Leeks; finely chopped, Chicken Stock, Potatoes; peeled and sliced, 
Saute leeks and onions in butter until soft and slightly colored. Add  potatoes and stock and simmer for 45 minutes, or until potatoes are soft.  Cool slightly, then process in a blender or food processor until pureed.  Add milk and season. Cool and refrigerate, overnight if possible. When  ready to serve, stir in cream and sprinkle with chives.    Notes: When using leeks it is extremely important to rinse them very very  well. They are full of sand ! In this particular recipe make sure to use  only the white part of the leeks. The soup is pure white when youre done.
