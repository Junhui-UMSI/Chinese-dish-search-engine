I made these for the first time today and I thought that they were really  good. The original recipe said that each muffin had 173 calories and 3  grams of fat. I calculated the calories at about 150 and the fat grams for  the entire recipe at about 22 (I only calculated for the oil, light butter,  and buttermilk powder). If you like light cake-like muffins, these arent  for you (but you might want to check "true confessions".    True Confessions: The original recipe called for 2 1/3 cups of buttermilk  and in my haste to convert to the buttermilk powder and water I forgot a  cup of water (I thought the batter seemed awfully stiff!). Actually, I  really like them this way but if you want lighter muffins, I suggest adding  a cup of water.    Stir together the dry ingredients for topping and cut in butter. Set aside.    Combine the flours, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, lemon  zest, and buttermilk powder in large bowl. Make a well in the center. Whisk  together the water, vanilla, and vegetable oil and pour the mixture into  the well. Stir just until blended. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into  18 paper-lined muffin tins. Sprinkle with topping mix.    Bake at 400 degrees until golden brown and wooden pick inserted in centers  comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on wire rack.    Each muffin has 150 calories.    Note:Next time I would add a little more salt (and maybe another cup of  water just to see...) I think that this would be good with other fruits  also, and maybe some nuts if you can spare the fat grams.    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by Mary <billy@napanet.net> on Oct 01, 1998,
