Almost Fat-Free Chocolate Pudding (Chandra)
Unsweetened cocoa, Cornstarch, Maraschino cherries;, Skim milk, Nonfat dry milk powder, Pure vanilla extract, Sugar, Skim milk, 
Combine the skim milk, milk powder, cocoa, and sugar in a 3-quart stainless  steel saucepan. Bring to a boil on high heat, stirring constantly. Lower  heat to prevent the mixture from boiling over. Add the cornstarch mixture  gradually while stirring at the same time. When the milk thickens to the  consistency of cake batter, which happens almost immediately, remove and  set aside. (If the milk does not thicken easily, add 1 Tbl. cornstarch  mixed with 2 Tbl. cold milk.) Stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the mixture  into a fancy serving dish and allow to cool. Refrigerate for at least 3  hours to enable the pudding to set. When the pudding feels firm (test by  tipping the bowl gently), garnish with cherries or your favorite fat-free  topping. Serve. Each serving provides: Calories 114, Protein 6.4g,  Carbohydrate 21.4g, Fat 0.6g, Sodium 91mg, Cholesterol 3mg.
