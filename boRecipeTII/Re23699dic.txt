Artichoke Pilaf
Garlic, Canned (not marinated), Water., Basmati rice, 
Rinse rice several times, until rinse water runs clear. Saute garlic and  herbs in olive oil until fragrant, about two minutes, being ultra careful  not to scorch the garlic. Add rice and saute an other two or three minutes.  Add artichoke hearts and saute another minute. Add water and bring to a  boil. Cover, reduce heat and cook about fifteen minutes. Turn off burner  and let sit five more minutes. Fluff with forks.    Note:    I got the idea for this while flipping through a book called _Trucs_of_  the_Trade_ @a bookstore one day.  I dont remember what all the guy called  for, but this seemed like the logical accopaniment to the above. Shared by  Bill Maddex
