Yesterday evening, with a friend coming over for dinner, I broke out Madhur  Jaffreys "Indian Cooking" and whipped up a dinnerful of subcontinental  dishes, which I thought Id share with the list. All three recipes derive  from that one book, which I cant recommend highly enough as a good  overview of all the various aspects of Indian food. None of these dishes  are outrageously (even notably) hot, but could be jacked up however you  like. Anyway, heres what we had last night:    Prep time: about 10 minutes    Cooking time: 1.5 hours    Place lentils and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Cover, reduce heat to low and allow to simmer 1 hour. About 45 minutes into  this, heat vegetable oil in a skillet large enough to hold all the  ingredients, over medium-high heat. When hot, add the ginger and chiles and  saute 10 seconds. Add spinach and coriander and cook, about 10 minutes or  spinach is wilted. Add the lentils, lemon juice and salt and mix well;  bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook another 25 minutes.  Test and adjust seasonings before serving.
