Serve buttered egg noodles and broccoli spears with this streamlined  classic, and a purchased apple tart afterward.    Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium heat until crisp and brown.  Transfer bacon to paper towel and drain. Crumble bacon.    Season chicken with salt and pepper.  Coat with flour; shake off excess.  Add chicken to same skillet and saute over medium heat until chicken is  brown and just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Using tongs,  transfer chicken to plate.    Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add onions, wine, broth and  thyme to skillet.  Bring to boil, scraping up browned bits. Reduce heat to  medium-low and simmer until onions are tender and sauce thickens slightly,  about 12 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Return chicken and any  accumulated juices to skillet. Simmer chicken until just heated through,  about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to plates. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with  bacon.
