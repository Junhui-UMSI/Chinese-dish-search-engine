I made half of this recipe, cubed  the potatoes instead of slicing them. Had leftover smoked sausage, sliced  and added that toward the end.    Whole process took less than 20 minutes to prepare.  Added 1/2 cup of milk  to the soup to thin it down some. Excellent    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 26, 98
