I just KNEW that I had a wasabi-chile recipe somewhere.  This is from a  restuarant in Sante Fe called Santacafe (recipe from "Santa Fe Recipe", a  cookbook with recipes from local Santa Fe restaurants)    In a medium bowl, finely grate the out grren rind of the lime.  Do not  grate the white pith. Finely chop the chiles (Adding the seeds, as always,  is up to you). Add everything to a big bowl and mix well. This is served in  the cookbook as a condiment with roasted Japanese eggplant.    John <Jaeger@msrc.sunysb.edu>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
