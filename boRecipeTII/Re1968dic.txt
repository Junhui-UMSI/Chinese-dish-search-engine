Chocolate Muffins
Cocoa; Dutch-process, Flour, Light brown sugar, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Salt, Chocolate chips, Eggs, milk, Vanilla, Vinegar, Butter or Margarine, 
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cocoa, flour, sugar, baking  powder, baking soda, salt and chocolate chips. Set aside.    In a large measuring cup or medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the  eggs, milk, vanilla and vinegar. Add the wet ingredients, along with the  melted butter or margarine, to the dry ingredients, stirring to blend.    Scoop the batter into 12 lightly greased muffin cups. Bake the muffins in a  preheated 425F oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted  in the center of a muffin comes out clean (watch them closely, as theyll  burn around the edges if they bake too long). Remove the muffins from the  oven, and after 5 minutes remove them from the pan, allowing them to cool  slightly on a wire rack before serving. Yield: 12 muffins.
