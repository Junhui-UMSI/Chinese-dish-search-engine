Texas Beef Barbeque
Bone stock, Salt and pepper, Beef brisket, Bay Leaves, 
Put the bay leaves in a about a cup of water and bring to a boil. Let it  simmer 10 minutes or so, then remove the leaves and add the bay tea to the  bone stock, along with the salt and pepper. Put the brisket in your Dutch  Oven and add the stock mixture to cover it about a quarter of the way.  Cover and cook over the fire, turning the brisket about every half hour  until its nearly done. This can be determined by forking. Mop it and lay  it on the grill to finish cooking, being sure to turn it and mop it every  20 minutes or so. To make a good natural gravy, add a little Worcestershire  Sauce and maybe a dash of chili powder to the liquid you cooked the brisket  in. You can also serve this with barbecue sauce.    NOTES : This is made out of beef brisket, which is one of the tastiest cuts  but the least thought of by the average housewife, unless she sometimes  buys it as corned beef.  It starts out pretty tough, but if you nurse it  right, its delicious.  Recipe by: Ya Got It From Lisa Lepsy    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by LizaCooks <LizaCooks@aol.com> on May 5, 1998
