Note: look for canned chipotle chilies and oyster  sauce in the ethnic section of your supermarket.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut stems off  portobellos and use for another purpose, such as  duxelles.  Clean caps with a wet cloth.  Bake  mushrooms about 3 minutes - longer if you are going to  eat them with a fork.  Meanwhile puree chipotles and  oyster sauce in a blender until smooth; add a little  water if necessary.  Set aside. Heat oil over medium  heat in a large saute pan.  Saute onions and poblanos  until mixture begins to wilt, then add salt to taste.  Mixture should be somewhat moist rather than dry  because onion and chilies can dry out in oven.  Continue to saute 3 minutes, then remove from heat and  cool. Place portobellos with gill side up in front of  you.  Brush top with chipotle-oyster sauce mixture.  Top with onion mixture.  Place mushrooms on baking  sheet and bake 5 minutes.  Remove and spread cheese  over tops. Return mushrooms to oven and bake another  minute or until all cheese is melted.  Serve  immediately.
