Presto Pots De Creme
14 oz. can, Sweetened condensed milk, Whipping cream -- whipped, Unsweetened Chocolate, Orange liqueur, 
1. Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Heat chocolate and sweetened  condensed milk in double boiler or a bowl set over a pan of hot water. Stir  until chocolate melts and mixture is blended.    2. Stir in liqueur, adjusting to taste, and let mixture cool to lukewarm.  Stir about a fourth of whipped cream into chocolate to lighten mixture.  Then fold in all but one large spoonful of remaining whipped cream.  Refrigerate remaining cream to decorate tops.    3. Spoon mixture into pots-de-creme pots, individual souffle cups, or small  dessert dishes. Chill in freezer about 30 minutes, or in refrigerator if  serving time is more than 30 minutes away. Decorate each dessert with a  dollop of reserved whipped cream.    Makes 8 servings, 1/2 cup each.    * Timesaver Tip: Recipe can be prepared up to a day ahead and stored,  covered, in refrigerator.    Microwave Version    Chocolate may be melted in the microwave oven. Place chocolate in a small  glass bowl. Microwave on 50% power until softened (2 to 2-1/2 minutes).  Stir until smooth. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch around edges  and wont blend smoothly. Add sweetened condensed milk, stir to blend, and  continue with step 2. Preparation time and timesaver tip same as above.
