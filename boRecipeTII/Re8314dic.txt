Toast pine nuts in 350 Foven, 8-10 mins or until golden brown. Watch them  carefully as they burn easily. Set aside. Cut a thin slice from the top of  each potato. Remove pulp, being careful not to tear the shells. Keep shells  warm. Crumble potato pulp. Add white sauce, salt, and Parmesan; mix  thoroughly. Add all other vegs except tomatoes; mix well. Add pine nuts;  mix thoroughly. Heap into shells. Garnish with diced toamto.    Note: You may vary the vegs according to what you have on hand. It is best  to have a colorful combo, all cooked just crisp-tender. You may either heat  the white sauce and vegs before adding to crumbled potato pulp, or add them  cold and put the stuffed potato in a 350 F oven, 10-15 mins before  garnishing with tomato.
