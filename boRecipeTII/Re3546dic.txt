Pecan Refrigerator Cookies
Baking Powder, Vanilla, Pecans, Light brown sugar, Flour, Salt, Butter, Eggs, 
Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat until  light again. Sift flour with baking powder and salt and work thoroughly  into creamed mixture. Stir in nuts and vanilla. Shape into long 1-1/4-inch  rolls. Wrap in waxed paper, and chill at least overnight. The longer you  chill, the better the cookies. Slice the dough as thin as possible and  place on greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 for about 8 minutes. Makes 8-10  dozen.
