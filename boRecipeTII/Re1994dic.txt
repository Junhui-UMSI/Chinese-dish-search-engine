Chorizo Stuffed Red Peppers
Orzo pasta, Olive oil, onion, Chorizo sausage, frozen peas, taco sauce, Red bell peppers, 
Cook the pasta al dente: drain and set aside. Heat oil in a pan and lightly  brown and crumble the chorizo with the diced onion. In a large bowl combine  the orzo, chorizo, peas, and 1/2 cup of the taco sauce. Mix well. Slice the  tops off the red peppers, removing inner ribs and seeds. Fill them with the  mixture, and spread a dollop of taco sauce across the tops. Bake covered in  a 350 F oven for 30 minutes or until soft.    >From Michael Kankiewicz, Business and Government Documents, Lockwood  Memorial Library, SUNY at Buffalo. In "Reporter", 12/11/97.
