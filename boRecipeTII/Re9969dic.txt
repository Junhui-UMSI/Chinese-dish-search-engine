Puri (Deep Fried Brown Bread)
Wholewheat flour, Salt, Oil for deep frying, Hot water, Vegetable oil, 
1. Sieve together with flour and salt. Rub in the oil. Add enough water to  make a stiff dough.    2. Put the dough on a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes till  soft and smooth.    3. Divide the mixture into 20 balls.    4. Take one ball at a time, flatten it on a slightly oiled surface and roll  into rounds of 10cm/4 inch across. (Do not stack the rolled puris on one  another as they might stick together.)    5. Heat the oil in a wok until very hot and add a poori, pressing the  middle with a slotted spoon so that it puffs up. Quickly turn and cook the  other side for a few seconds. Drain and serve hot.
