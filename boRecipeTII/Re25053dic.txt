This tastes sort of ginger-bready. You cant tell theres a drop of tomato  soup in it.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cream butter, sugar and egg. Sift together dry  ingredients and add to creamed mixture. Stir in raisins, (nuts), and tomato  soup. Mix until well blended. Pour into greased 8 1/2x4 1/2" loaf pan. Bake  one hour or until done.
