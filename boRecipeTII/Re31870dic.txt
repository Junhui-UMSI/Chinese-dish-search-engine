T-Man Special
Serving spoon pinto beans, Heaping serving spoon sliced, Jalepeno pepper slices (up, (individual size) frito corn, Pieces sliced smoked sausage, Diced onion, (heaping) grated cheese, 
Pour fritos in large bowl. Add sausge and brisket. Pour pintos and extra  sauce on top. Top with onions and jalepenos.    Heres a recipe to use if your lucky enough to have some trimmings or end  pieces of several kinds of bbq meat left over. Its good enough to use first  run stuff if you dont have leftovers, IMHO. Thought it might go ok for a  super bowl party.    This is for one serving. You can make as many as you have meat for and  need.    This recipe comes from observation and many trials of a menu item from a  small, shopping center bbq joint located near Texas Instruments in Austin,  Tx. The owner of the joint called it T-man because the first ones he made  were for his regulars, just to clean up the bits and pieces leftover from  a frantic lunch crowd. The T was for trash-man. Word of mouth about how  good the concoction was caused him to make it a full fledged menu item.  Hope yall like it as much as I do.
