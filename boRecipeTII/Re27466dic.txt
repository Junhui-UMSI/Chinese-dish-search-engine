From: Hannah.Wolfish@ssa.gov    Date: Mon, 12 Aug 96 13:10:37 EST  Last year, my then 5th grader was doing a report on the state of North  Dakota.  He sent a couple of letters to Gov. Ed Schafer who was kind enough  to reply. My son asked for a kosher recipe from "Gov. Ed" and he sent back  this recipe which was simple enough for my son to make. He made several  batches for my older sons bar mitzvah kiddush and they were gobbled up. In  gratitude for the recipe, my son sent a recipe for Cholent to the governor  since barley is a major crop in ND. Anyway, this is a really delicious bar  cookie.    Cream Shortening and sugar , add flour.  Press in 13x9 greased pan, bake at      350    for 10 minutes.    Mix next 3 ingredients and add the rest  and mix.  Spread over baked  cookie-like mixture then bake at 300 for an additional 25 minutes.  Cut  into bars and sprinkle with conf. sugar.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 314    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
