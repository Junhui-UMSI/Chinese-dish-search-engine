From: JVANDERF@tmu1.mcrest.edu    Date: 10 Dec 93 10:00:11 CST  Mix well the first three ingredients in a large glass bowl. Microwave for 4  minutes on high**.  Stir well.  Microwave for another 4 minutes on high**.    To the above mixture, add the butter, vanilla extract, and salt.  Microwave  two more minutes.    Add the baking soda and stir rapidly.  Pour quickly into a 9" x 13"  buttered pan. When cool, remove and break into pieces. Note: the  temperature at which to set your microwave varies according to its maximum  power.  If your microwave is 700 watts, as mine is, I suggest that you use  a slightly lower setting, such as medium high, or you may have trouble with  the mixture burning.
