After Midnight
Brown rum (optional), Fresh cold milk, Spoons instant coffee, Spoons instant cocoa, 
Put 2 spoonfull of instant coffee and 2 spoonfull of instant cacoa in a  glass with fresh cold milk. Add some cream.  It also tastes fine with a  spot of brown rum (sp?) (I prefer jamaican!) This really pushs you up.    Date: Tue, 25 Jun 1996 20:14:51 0000    From: Allison Greene <argreene@nando.net>    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #129    From the MasterCook recipe list.
