Recipe by: hunt@austin.metrowerks.com (Eric Hunt) Marinate chicken breast  in your favorite Italian-style dressing for several hours. Grill outside  until 3/4 done or bake in a 350deg oven for 15 minutes.    Make sure 1/2 c sundried tomatoes are in a 1-c container. Fill container to  top with boiling water, set aside for 10-15 minutes.    Chop chicken into bite-sized pieces. Cover and set aside.    When sundrieds have reconstituted, chop coarsely (at least chop each tomato  in half, depending on how much tomato you can handle in one bite)    Prepare pizza dough. Spread with a decent amount (not light, not heavy) of  pesto to 1/3 inch from edge of crust. You may want to initially brush entir  surface of dough liberally with olive oil, depending on your taste.    Strategically place chopped chicken and sundried tomatoes over surface of  pesto. Sprinkle half of the mushrooms on top of all this.    Cover with cheese.    Sprinkle remaining mushrooms on surface of cheese.    Bake at 375 until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and hinting at  turning golden.    source unknown
