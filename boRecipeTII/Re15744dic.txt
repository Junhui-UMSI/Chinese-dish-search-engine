Abalone Saute
Butter, Abalone Slices, Egg, Cream, Fine cracker crumbs, 
1 pound Abalone serves 2-3. Pound slices of Abalone very, very thin. Mix  egg and cream. Dip slices of Abalone in egg mixture, dredge in crumbs.  Saute in bubbling hot butter about 1 minute per side. Longer cooking  toughens Abalone. Serve with cottage fired potatoes.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by ehgf@primenet.com (Ellen) on Jan 4, 1998
