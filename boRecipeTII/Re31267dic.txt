Make pancakes with lager, flour and egg, and cook in the normal way (I used  a cooking spray to grease a non-stick frying pan). Fold each pancake in  half, and then in half again, so it forms a quarter-circle (if youre as  bad at cooking pancakes as I am, theyll come out in bits anyway - if so,  pretend it didnt happen!), and place them in a large flan dish.    Peel bananas, cut in half long-ways and in half again cross-ways, and place  face-down on top of the pancakes. Put the remaining ingredients into a  frying pan or small saucepan, and boil for 3-4 minutes, until just  beginning to be syrupy.  Pour over bananas and pancakes, and bake in a  moderate oven (Mark 4 - 350 F) for 20-30 minutes.    I served this with fromage frais (cream substitute) and a chocolate sauce,  for which the recipe follows:    Recipe by: Annabel Smith Converted to MM by Donna Webster  donna@webster.demon.co.uk
