BARTHS IN THE FRENCH WEST INDIES. ** This is  a most appealing, upbeat meal. And although I like these dishes served hot,  they are also good served at room temperature or chilled in hot weather.  Snow peas make an excellent addition to the plate. ** A warm orange cake  served with warm orange syrup from Mayas, a restaurant perched right on  the waters edge, is a delicious finish for the meal. For a more festive  appearance, serve sliced, sugared strawberries or raspberries on the side.  ** Mandel is a cookbook author.
