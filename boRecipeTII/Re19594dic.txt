Melt bacon fat and butter in heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Add  onions and saute until clear, add celery and cook gently for about 5 mins.  Add seafood products and saute in saucepan at medium high heat to coat,  flavor and brown slightly.    Add flour, and milk, stirring well to avoid lumps.    Add remaining ingredients, except peas, in order of required cooking time  (ie potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes, peppers, etc). Add wine and season to  taste. Heat until heated through, but do not boil. Add peas about 20 min  before serving. Use milk to thin as necessary.    Sealegs are imitation crab meat, usually pollock with crab flavouring.    If chowder is to be frozen prior to serving, do not add the milk until  reheating.
