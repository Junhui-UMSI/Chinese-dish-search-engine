Heres a recipe for the dreaded haggis.  The book notes that, in  addition to the other naughty bits, the lungs are traditionally  included in Scotland, but are omitted here as its illegal to sell  lungs in the U.S. (Any clues as to why, anybody?).  Some folks also  think that liver shouldnt be used...    Wash stomach well, rub with salt and rinse.  Remove membranes and  excess fat.  Soak in cold salted water for several hours.  Turn  stomach inside out for stuffing.    Cover heart and liver with cold water, Bring to a boil, reduce heat,  cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Chop heart and coarsely grate liver.    Toast oatmeal in a skillet on top of the stove, stirring frequently,  until golden.  Combine all ingredients and mix well.  Loosely pack  mixture into stomach, about two-thirds full.  Remember, oatmeal  expands in cooking.    Press any air out of stomach and truss securely.  Put into boiling  water to cover.  Simmer for 3 hours, uncovered, adding more water as  needed to maintain water level.  Prick stomach several times with a  sharp needle when it begins to swell; this keeps the bag from  bursting.  Place on a hot platter, removing trussing strings.  Serve  with a spoon.    Ceremoniously served with "neeps and nips"++mashed turnips, nips of  whiskey and mashed potatoes.
