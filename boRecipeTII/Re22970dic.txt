This recipe was given to me by a chef from the Culinary Institute of  America (CIA).  It may seem strange, but try it--its one of the most  delightful items in my collection!     Saute onion, carrots, celery, eggplant, green pepper and garlic in oil  until lightly browned. Add remaining ingredients except parsley and mint  and simmer until lentils are tender. Add parsley and mint. Adjust  seasonings to your taste. Bon Appetit!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
