Vernons Jerk Style Jamaican Chicken
Fresh ginger, White wine vinegar, Dark soy sauce, Fresh Jamaican chiles, white onions, Ground allspice, Chicken, Fresh thyme leaves, Black Pepper, 
This pungent Jamaican sauce can be used to marinate pork butts (makes em  run faster), beef round roasts, porgies, red snapper, as well as chicken.  Says Vernon, "You can even use my sauce like ketchup. One guy pours it on  his scrambled eggs." The sauce keeps well in the refrigerator tightly  covered.    JERK SAUCE    * Pulverize the onions, chiles, and ginger in a blender or food processor.  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the allspice, thyme, black  pepper, vinegar, and soy sauce.    * Coat the chicken with the sauce.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator  for 24 hours, turning once.    * Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place a meat thermometer in one of the  thigh pieces.  Place a shallow pan of boiling water on the oven floor. Put  the chicken on a rack and place in a roasting pan. Roast, basting  frequently with the sauce, until three-quarters cooked (120 degrees on the  meat thermometer), 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven.  Remove the meat thermometer    * Preheat a broiler or grill    * Baste the chicken with more jerk sauce.  Sear the chicken for 5 minutes  under a preheated broiler or over a very hot charcoal fire. Remove from the  heat and let sit for 15 minutes before eating    * Serves 6    NOTE: Be sure to wear rubber gloves when handling these very hot peppers.  If you dont you could irritate and burn your skin. Keep your gloves away  from your face and eyes.
