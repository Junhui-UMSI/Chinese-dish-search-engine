In large bowl combine  flour, sugar, cornstarch, baking powder and salt. In medium bowl, using  fork or wire whisk, mix egg whites, milk, corn syrup and vanilla. Add to  flour mixture, stir until smooth, but as little as possible. Pour into  prepared pan. Bake in 350 F oven 20-25 minutes or until toothpick inserted  in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on wire rack.

Not nearly as good a texture as the chocolate cake .    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
