So, here goes something my  mom used to make..    Albondigas: Soak bread in water, squeeze it dry, and mix with meat, egg,  and seasonings. Shape meat into walnut-sized balls. Brown onion in 2T fat.  Remove onion and reserve.  Brown meatballs.    After meat has browned, add reserved onion, tomato, more spices as above  and cilantro to taste, and 4-6C boiling water. Simmer slowly for 1 1/2  hours.    For Soup: Mash tomato through a sieve or in a blender.  Bring to a boil in  a large pan, adding enough water to make 2 quarts of liquid.    Add chile pulp, salt and oregano. Boil down to about 3 pints liquid.  Add  albondigas, and simmer for about 1 hour.    NOTE: we like anchos for this, but pasilla or other dried pepper soaked in  hot (not boiling) water for about 30 minutes would work well.  Discard  water, and process till you get a nice paste. Any leftover can be frozen  for later use.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #243    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
