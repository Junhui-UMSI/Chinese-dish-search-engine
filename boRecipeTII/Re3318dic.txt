Drain the pears thoroughly on paper toweling. Combine the cocoa and sugar  in a mixer bowl, then blend into the cream. Add the salt, vanilla and mint  extracts. Soften the gelatin in 1 tablespoon of cold water, then dissolve  over hot water. Add the gelatin to the cream mixture and stir until smooth.  Chill until of spreading consistency. Fill the cavities of the pears and  spread the cut sides with the chocolate mixture. Place 2 pear halves  together to form whole pears, then place in a shallow dish, chill for at  least 1 hour. Arrange each pear in a stemmed compote and spoon the Creme de  Cacao over the pears. Garnish with Chocolate Leaves and chill until ready  to serve. Note: These are great for a quick last minute dessert, and if you  have a bit more time, try using fresh pears which have been peeled and  poached until tender. For a special treat, inject the pears with some of  the Creme de Cacao, or Creme de Menthe.
