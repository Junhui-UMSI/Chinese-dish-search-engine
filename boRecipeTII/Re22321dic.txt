There he dishes out servings of soup for $6 and up at the  International Soup Kitchen, on West 55th Street. Yeganeh once shared his  recipe for turkey chili on David Lettermans show. This is a written  version, as tweaked and tested by Food Editor Gillian Duffy of New York  Magazine. If desired substitute two whole chickens for the turkey.
