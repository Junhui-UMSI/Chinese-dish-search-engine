Corn flour; or stone ground, Vanilla extract, Vegetable oil; or melted, Baking Powder, Salt, Eggs, Butter; for the pan OR spray, Unbleached flour;, Uncooked millet, Sugar, Baking soda, Buttermilk, 
MAKES 12 3-inch pancakes or 6 waffles.    Cover the millet the millet with hot water and set it aside while you  assemble the rest of the ingredients.    Put the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix them together. Beat the egg in  another bowl and stir in the buttermilk, vanilla, and oil. Pour the liquids  into the dry ingredients and gently whisk them together until well  combined.    Strain the millet and put it in a wide skillet over medium heat. The water  will steam, softening the grains: then the millet will dry and begin to  toast. Gently shake the pan back and forth, as if youre making popcorn.  When it begins to pop and smell toasty, stir it into the batter.    Melt a small piece of butter in a nonstick skillet. When the pan is hot,  add about 1/4 cup of batter, cook over medium heat until holes begin to  appear on the surface, then gently turn the pancake over and cook on the  other side. For lighter cakes, resist any temptation to pat them down with  a spatula or turn them more than once.    To make waffles, separate the eggs and beat the whites until they form soft  but firm peaks. Stir a third of them into the batter to lighten it, then  fold in the rest.
