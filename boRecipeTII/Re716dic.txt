Cut the bread into 1 inch slices and then into 1 inch squares.  Toast in a  400  oven until nice and golden brown.    Grease the bottom of a casserole (just a little smaller than 9 X 13) and  place the toasted bread equally spread in the casserole.  Drizzle the  butter over the top of the bread squares.    Combine the rest of the pudding ingredients and pour over the bread.    Bake at 350  until the custard is firm.  This will take approximately 45  minutes.    To make a peach bread pudding, place sliced peaches on top before baking.    Vanilla Sauce    Combine the cream and sugar in a pan.  Bring to a boil.  Remove from the  heat.  Beat the yolks, flour, vanilla, and salt.  Stir in a little of the  hot cream to temper.  Add this mixture to the rest of the hot mixture.  Cook, stirring continually (dont overcook) until just thickened.  Remove  and add the ice cream.  Stir until the ice cream is melted.  Strain through  a fine sieve or cheesecloth.    If you like the flavor of brandy or Grand Marnier, add to the custard (to  taste) after it is done.    I like the sauce to be warm when I serve it.    Taken from an episode of Chef du Jour/FTVN.  The chef was from the  Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Marie Bordewisch <msleukie@mindspring.com>  on Nov 07, 1998
