re: tuna ... I found this on the Starchef.com site. sounded good. anybody  got quail eggs?    All ingredients are to be divided by four for preparation of each  individual serving plate. Mince tuna and put into a 2 inch ring mold. Place  on 10 inch dinner plate and remove mold. Separate yolk from white of quail  egg and place yolk on top of tuna. Discard white. Place 1/2T diced pears  above the tuna at "12 oclock" and proceed around plate with 1/4T minced  Jalapeno at "10", 1/2t garlic at "8", and 1T toasted pine nuts at "6".    Sprinkle plate with 1/4t chili powder, 1/4t salt, 1/4t white pepper, 1T  mint.    Drizzle pine nuts with 1T sesame oil.    Toast 2 slices of bread for each plate. remove crust. Slice diagonally to  form triangles and place at right side plate. After presentation of plate  to diner, all ingredients should be mixed to create the tartare.
