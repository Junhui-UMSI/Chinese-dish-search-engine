Banana Butter
Finely chopped red, Sugar, Ripe bananas, Butter or margarine, Lemon juice, 
I love this Banana Butter much more than the Apple Butter.    Thoroughly mash bananas; measure 4 cups into 4 to 6 quart kettle or Dutch  oven. Add sugar, lemon juice, cherries, and butter; mix well. Bring to hard  rolling boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat; simmer gently, uncovered,  20 minutes, stirring often. Pour into hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace.  Adjust lids. Process in boiling water bath (half-pints)       10    minutes. Makes 6 half-pints.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 188 by "Bonnie"  <solomon1@kcsnet.com> on Nov 1, 1997
