Worlds Best Brownies
Unsweetened Chocolate, Butter, Eggs (yes, 4), Flour, Sugar, Salt, Walnuts, Vanilla, 
Grease a 9"x13" pan. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Melt chocolate and  butter in a double boiler, or gently(!) in a small saucepan [or a  microwave, but not together, butter melts much faster than chocolate,  Tovah]. Let it cool a bit. Stir in sugar and salt. Add eggs ONE AT A  TIME, stirring between each one. Add the flour and mix. DO NOT  OVERMIX, it will make the brownies tough. Add the vanilla and nuts,  and bake for ONLY 20 to 25 minutes. DO NOT OVERCOOK, it will make the  brownies dry and caky.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
