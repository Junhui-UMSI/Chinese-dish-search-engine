Chicken breast, Flour, Salt, Black Pepper, Paprika, Butter, olive oil, Dry sherry, Fresh Lemon Juice, Lemon, Capers, Fresh parsley, 
Flatten chicken breasts until about 1/4 inch thick.   Combine flour, salt,  pepper and paprika in a bag. Add breasts and shake well.   Heat butter and  olive oil in skillet until bubbly. Saute chicken breasts a few at a time  for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Drain and keep warm.   Drain off all but 2  Tablespoons oil. Stir in sherry or wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet  to loosen any browned bits. Add lemon juice and slices and heat. Add capers and sprinkle with parsley.   To serve, pour the sauce over the chicken breasts.    MRS. ROBERT M. EUBANKS, JR.    From ~~ltTraditions: A Taste of the Good Life>, by the Little Rock (AR) Junior  League.
