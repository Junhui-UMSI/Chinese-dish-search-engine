Basic Cholent
Cold water, Beef marrow, barley, Stew meat, Onion, Vegetable oil, Black pepper, Red potatoes, white beans, Salt, Red kidney beans, garlic, 
Brown meat and onions in oil in saucepan, or place meat and onions beneath  oven broiler for a few minutes.    Rinse barley in a sieve under cold running water. Pick over beans and rinse  thoroughly. Peel potatoes (I dont) and cut into rounds. Add barley, beans,  potatoes, bones and garlic to meat and onions in the saucepan.    Add 6-7 cups of cold water, or enough to cover, and bring to a boil over  high heat. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for one hour. Skim froth  as it rises to the surface.    Place the cholent in a preheated low oven (200-250 degrees F) and let it  heat until the following day. A few hours before lunch check the cholent.  If it is too moist, uncover it and leave it in the oven to dry.    This also works great with a clay pot, or in a slow cooker.
