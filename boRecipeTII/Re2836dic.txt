1.  Preheat oven to 425F. In a food processor, grind cookies into  fine crumbs. Add melted butter and process until well mixed. Press  crumb mixture into bottom and two thirds up the sides of a 9" spring-  form pan. Set aside.    2.  In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar with an  electric mixer on medium speed until light, fluffy and smooth 2-3 min.  Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat  in flour, milk and vanilla. Beat until well blended and smooth, about        4    minutes.    3.  Sprinkle 4 packages of chopped peanut butter cups evenly on bottom  of chocolate crust. Carefully pour cheesecake mixture over all; spread  evenly.    4.  Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 250 F and bake 40-50  minutes longer, or until edges are set and cake jiggles only slightly  in center.    5.  Let cheesecake cool at room temperature, then refrigerate until  well chilled, about 6 hours or overnight. Run a knife around the pan  edge to loosen cake, and remove. Shortly before serving garnish with  whipped cream and sprinkle two remaining packages chopped peanut  butter cups on top.
