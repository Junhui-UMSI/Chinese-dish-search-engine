Place mushrooms hole side up on a baking sheet  and broil in oven for 6-8 minutes. Turn mushrooms over (insides will be  full of liquid) and broil another 5 minutes. Meanwhile, saute eggplant,  onion, garlic and italian seasoning in a non-stick pan on medium heat until  eggplant is very soft -- about 12-15 minutes. Remove from heat and mix with  breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. Stuff mushroom caps and bake at 375 for  18-20 minutes, or until stuffing looks browned. Enjoy! I made these on  Christmas Eve and got rave reviews!! S.M. Brooks    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #138    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
