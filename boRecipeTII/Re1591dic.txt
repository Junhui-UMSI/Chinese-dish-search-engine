Source: My vegetarian friend, Esther    Heat oil/leeks and onion-saute untilsoft. (5 or 6 medium regular onions can  be substituted for the leeks&onions-according to taste). Add carrots and  cabbage-simmer until wilted. Add thyme. Add water & broth powder, stir  well, cover boil-simmer at medium heat for 10 minutes. Add miso, lemon  juice, honey. Simmer 3-4 minutes. Add tomato & pepper. Simmer to your  hearts content.    A couple of notes: my husband hates leeks so i substitute. This is the  original recipe. I usually keep overripe tomatoes in the freezer  specifically for this soup. First I cover the wilted cabbage and carrots  with boiling water.Then I add a big can of tomato paste instead of tomato  sauce. Then I throw in the frozen tomatoes and keep simmering. Of course,  if you use it for pesach, the miso does not go in.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Charles Rosenstein <cr18@gezernet.co.il> on  Oct 27, 1998,
