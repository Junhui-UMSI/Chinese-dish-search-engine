This thick and sturdy herbed omelet lets the full flavor of fresh  artichokes shine through.    Prepare artichokes (see recipe for Young Artichokes and Fava Beans  Stewed in Olive Oil) and cut them into 1/2-inch cubes.    Heat the olive oil in a medium-sized, heavy-bottomed skillet over  medium heat.  Add the garlic and saute until translucent, 2 to 3  minutes. Reduce heat slightly and add the artichoke cubes; saute  until tender, about 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add the grated  potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add the eggs, salt, pepper  and herbs.    To set the eggs, let them cook for 2 or 3 minutes, without stirring,  then lift the set edges and tilt the skillet slightly to let the  uncooked egg run underneath.  Repeat until the egg is set.    Serve hot or cold, cut into wedges.    Serves 4.    PER SERVING:  335 calories, 18 g protein, 31 g carbohydrate, 18 g fat  (4 g saturated), 422 mg cholesterol, 524 mg sodium, 10 g fiber.
