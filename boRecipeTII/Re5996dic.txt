Pita Bread Technique
Yeast, Flour, Water, 
For pita bread just use any ordinary flour, water, yeast, salt bread recipe  of your choice.  There is no magic recipe.  Do the dough in the usual way,  let it rise once.  Punch it down and do a superficial kneading.  Then  divide the dough into lumps - the size depends on what size pita you want.  A spherical blob that is about 1.5-2.0" in diameter will satisfy most  needs.  Knead each blob by holding it in one hand and kneading it with the  thumb of the opposite hand, always kneading into the middle of the blob  until it is silky and smooth.  Place kneaded blob on a lightly floured  surface and roll to a 6-7 inch pancake shape.  Place on lightly floured  board or cookie sheet, allowing space for a bit of expansion. Cover  potential pitas with a towel, then some plastic film, and let rise until a  bit puffy.  Gently move puffy pitas to a lightly greased cookie sheet and  put cookie sheet with pitas into a hot oven (400-450 F).  Watch carefully.  They should puff after a short wait.  Bake until just browning - you dont  want a brittle crust.    It is very easy after you try it once, and the failures are wonderful bread  in any case - puffed or not.    ~->(Ron Parker) rbparker@prtel.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
