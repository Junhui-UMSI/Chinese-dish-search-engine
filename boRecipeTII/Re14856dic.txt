Winner Jean McGree of Flossmoor "bores everyone," she says, with this  family tale of Christmas praline cookies: "Since the time Mom had been a  little girl, each November Grandma would surround her back yard pecan tree  with sheets to catch the falling nuts. But most of the nuts had to be  knocked from the branches with her long-handled broom. Then she would spend  hours stooped over those sheets, picking up the pecans and sorting the good  ones from the black and hollow shells.      "When her daughter married and moved away, the nuts were carefully picked  over, packaged and shipped up North. Free time in the first week of  December was always marked for shelling the pecans. Sore hands and stiff  backs were repaid with secret nibbling and promises of praline cookies for  Christmas.      "Soon, Ill start looking for a package from Great-Grandma in South  Carolina. Then, as we crack the pecans, I can retell the pecan story to  Michael and Ann, who know that Santa always looks for pralines on Christmas  Eve." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest  December 4, 1986  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000
