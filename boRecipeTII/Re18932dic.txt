Cut up the lobster and remove the shells.  Combine  the olive oil, wine, saffron and garlic. Marinate the seafood in the olive  oil mixture until needed. To prepare, pour the fumet over the fish and  marinade mixture. Cook the angel hair pasta in salted boiling water until  al dente. Simmer until the shells (on clams, oysters, scallops or mussels)  open. Place the angel hair in the bottom of a soup bowl. Pour the broth and  seafood over it. Garnish with the blanched julienned vegetables. Serve with  small rounds of toast coated with Sauce Rouille.    EAT-L Digest 12 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
