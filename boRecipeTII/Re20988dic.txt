Apple Pie
2 tsp lemon juice, Nutmet, Each brown and white sugar, Margarine, Pie crusts, Cinnamon, Sliced apples (up to 7), Lemon peel, 
Mix lemon peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and sugars. Put 1/2 of apples in bottom  of crust. Sprinkle 1/2 of the sugar mixture. Add rest of apples. Put rest  of sugar mix on top. Sprinkle lemon juice over apples. Dot with 3 tbsps  margarine. Add top pie crust (slice it to release steam).
