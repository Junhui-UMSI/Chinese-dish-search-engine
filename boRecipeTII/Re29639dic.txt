Scrub potatoes and eggs with brush to clean. Place unpeeled potatoes and  eggs into cold water deep enough to cover potatoes and eggs. Bring to boil.  Take out eggs when they are done (after boiling about 15 minutes). Run the  eggs under cold water and peel shell off - cool. While potatoes are boiling  chop up celery, onion, dill pickles and eggs.    When potatoes are fork tender, remove from boiling water, slip off the  skins, break up into a bowl and cool.    Toss together the crumbled potatoes and chopped ingredients. Add the celery  seed, worcestershire, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Texas Pete Honey Mustard  sauce, salt and pepper.    Mix mayonnaise and mustard in equal proportions (whatever you think you  need for the amount of potato mixture). You may want more mayonnaise than  mustard. Mix gradually into the potato mixture until it is the desired  consistency. Taste as you are mixing. Add salt and pepper. Sprinkle with  paprika. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
