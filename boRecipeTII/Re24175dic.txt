Stir water into Master Mix, adding a little at a time to allow the  dehydrated ingredients to absorb enough water to rehydrate. 3. When batter  is well blended, spread it in a greased baking pan and sprinkle the  Breakfast Gorp over the top. Drizzle the last of the melted margarine over  the Gorp and bake, about 30 minutes.
