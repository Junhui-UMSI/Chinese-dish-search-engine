Baked Custard
Eggs, Sugar, milk, Nutmeg (optional), Vanilla, 
In a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs. Stir in milk, sugar, vanilla, and  salt. Place a 1-quart casserole or six 6-ounce custard cups in a 13x9x2  baking pan on oven rack. Pour custard mixture into casserole or cups.  Sprinkle with nutmeg, if desired. Pour boiling water into the pan around  casserole or custard cups to a depth of 1 inch. Bake at 325 for 50 to 60  minutes for the 1-quart casserole, 30 to 40 minutes for the custard cups,  or until a knife inserted near center comes out clean. Serve warm or  chilled. To unmold chilled individual custards, first loosen edges with a  spatula or knife, then invert onto serving plate.    Variation: Baked Coffee Custard. Prepare as above, adding 4 tsp instant  (decaf) coffee crystals dissolved in 1 Tbsp hot water to eggs along with  milk, sugar, etc. Omit nutmeg. Serve topped with whipped cream, sprinkled  with toasted almonds.
