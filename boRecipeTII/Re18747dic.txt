Blackened garlic, lentils, and pasta was one of Bob Calderones favorite  combinations when he was a boy. Calderone, chef-owner of Anago in the Lenox  Hotel, now turns the combination into a bisque. Here is an adaptation of  his recipe.    Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Add the  garlic and cook, turning often, until charred, about 5 minutes. Put in the  onion and cook for an additional 4 minutes or until lightly browned. Add  the tomatoe paste and wine, and cook while stirring until the tomato paste  dissolves and the wine bubbles. Add the lentils and chicken stock, and  bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 45 minutes or  until the lentils are tender. Add more stock or water to keep the lentils  covered. Remove from the heat and, when cool enough to handle, puree in  batches in a processor. Refrigerate overnight.    The next day, bring the soup to a gentle simmer. Stir in the cream and more  stock or water if it is too thick and heat thoroughly. Season with salt and  pepper, and garnish with chopped tomatoes and Italian parsley, if desired.
