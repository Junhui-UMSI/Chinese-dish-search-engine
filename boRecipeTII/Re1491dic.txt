beans, dried, Water, Ham, Celery, Onion, Carrots, Beef soup base, Chicken soup base, Red pepper flakes, Dill weed, Caraway seeds, Garlic, 
If using beans other than Limas. To make sure the beans are tender at the  end of the cooking time, soak beans overnight, or boil on stovetop for 10  minutes prior to adding them to the crockpot. (I normally use home-grown  horticultural beans which are close to pinto beans)    Combine all ingredients in crockpot.  Cook on low 8 hours or until beans  are tender.    Note: Use 4 cups water for Baby Lima beans.        Use 2 T dried vegetables in place of 1 c fresh.        I use 1 T dried carrot tops in place of sliced fresh carrots.
