Abm Wheatlet and Corn Flour Bread
Cream of wheat cereal, Salt, Wheat germ, Oat bran, Corn Flour, Veg oil, Sugar, Yeast, All purpose flour, Water, 
Add the liquid and solid ingredients and the yeast in order according to  the manufacturers instructions. Run on regular/basic and medium crust.    The cream of wheat is not as gritty as cornmeal and yet the corn flour  provides the corn taste.    I made my first loaf with parsley but as for any cornmeal bread or muffin,  the addition of garlic, chiles, bacon bits and/or cheese should work.    An original recipe by Jim Weller.
