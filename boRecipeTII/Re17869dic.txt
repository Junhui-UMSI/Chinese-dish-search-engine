(If you  dont use ginger, just mince the garlic.) In a large saucepan, heat 1/2 cup  of water over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook for 10 minutes, or  until golden brown, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and add  garlic mixture and the chili. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add  the potatoes and cook 5 minutes. (You may have to add a little water to  prevent sticking.) Reduce heat to medium low and add the tomatoes and  spices. Cook, covered, 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Add more  water if you like it to have a little more sauce. Sprinkle with garnish.  Serves 4.
