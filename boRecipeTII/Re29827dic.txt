Tender Beef Brisket with Onions
Water, Garlic, Salt, Onions, Potato starch, Paprika, Pepper, Brisket point roast, 
In large roasting pan, place brisket, fat side up. Season with garlic,  salt, pepper and paprika. Top with onions; pour in water around meat. Bring  to boil, uncovered, on stove top. Roast, uncovered, in 325 F oven for 3  hours, turning roast over occasionally, each time spooning onions back onto  meat. Roast, covered, for 4 to 4-1/2 hours longer or until very tender. Let  cool; cover and refrigerate overnight. Skim off fat. Trim fat from meat;  slice thinly. Set aside. In bowl, blend potato starch with 1 cup of the  cold pan juices. In roasting pan, bring remaining cooking liquid to boil  over medium-high heat. Gradually stir in potato starch mixture, cooking  until sauce has thickened smoothly. Return meat to pan, reduce heat to  medium-low and heat until steaming hot. To serve, arrange meat on platter,  mounding onions over top. Makes about 16 servings.
