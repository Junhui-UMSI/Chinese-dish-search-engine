Garlic Flavored Oil-Cold Infusion Method
Distilled white vinegar, olive oil, garlic, 
Choose unblemished garlic without cracks or soft spots. Soak cloves in  vinegar for 15 minutes, drain, and rinse under cold, running water. Drain,  dry well, then out in blender with oil and pulse until chopped. Do not  blend to a pure or the oil and garlic will be too difficult to separate.    Strain pure immediately through a fine-mesh strainer such as a china cap.  Strain again through 4 layers of cheesecloth and put in a sterilized glass  bottle. Cover tightly and refrigerate. Use within 1 week for optimum  flavor.    Flavored Oils by Michael Chiarello ISBN 0-8118-0898-X pg 21    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Oct 26, 98
