Crust;  Put pecans in swall bowl with butter and MW on high for 1 1/2  minutes. Stir dry ingredients together in 10-inch springform pan. Add  butter and nuts and mix well. Pat onto bottom and sides.   Filling: Beat cream cheese until light. Add sugar and beat until light and  fluffy. Add eggs one at a time; beating after each one. Add remaining  ingredients except berries and mix well. Pour into pan. Drop berries on top  and push down with fork so that batter covers them. Bake at 350 for 1 1/2  hours in which a pan of water has been placed on the bottom rack. Remove  from oven and run   knife around the edge to loosen from pan and prevent a  cracked cake when cooling. Topping: Stir sugar and cornstarch well in  saucepan. Add berries and   water and cook over medium heat until thick and  bubbly. Stir in   rum. Pour over cooled cake. (I refrigerate the cake for a  day first, then put topping on just before serving).    Ann Raisler posted this originally. Then formatted by Rita Taule.
