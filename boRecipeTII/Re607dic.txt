Strain vinegar mixture through a cheesecloth-lined sieve into a glass  measure or medium bowl, and discard shallots and crushed garlic cloves.  Pour into a decorative bottle. Thread peeled garlic cloves onto a bamboo  skewer; place in bottle. Seal with a cork or other airtight lid; store in a  cool, dark place.

It also gives a subtle hint of garlic to sweet and  sour cabbage.
