Place a slice of  apple on each triangle and roll it up to encase the apple.  Place all the  little bundles into a dish, touching each other slightly.    Mix the cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkle over the top of all the  bundles.  Sprinkle orange zest over them also.  Drizzle the orange juice  between the bundles, not over them.    Bake at the temperature given on the crescent roll dough directions until  browned.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
