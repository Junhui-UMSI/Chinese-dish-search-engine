Baked Scrambled Egg Casserole
Margarine or butter, Green onions; sliced, Cream of mushroom soup, Cheddar cheese; shredded, Half & Half or cream, Cooked ham; chopped, Eggs, 
These recipes come from Culinary Cyber Sleuth. The first one has no chiles  but think they would make a wonderful addition and it sounds great for a  special holiday occasion, as does the 2nd one.    Heat oven to 250 degrees. Grease a 2-quart casserole. In large skillet,  melt margarine. Saute onions until crisp tender. In large bowl, beat eggs;  stir in half & half and ham. Pour egg mixture into skillet with onions; mix  well. Cook over medium heat. As mixture begins to set, gently lift cooked  portions with spatula so that thin uncooked portions can flow to bottom.  Avoid constant stirring. Cook until eggs thickened throughout; spoon into  prepared casserole dish. Pour soup evenly over top. Bake at 250 degrees for  30 minutes; sprinkle with cheddar cheese and bake 10-15 minutes longer.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #202 by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on  Nov 16, 1997
