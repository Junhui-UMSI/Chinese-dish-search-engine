Cover  with salt solution:  1/2 cup plain salt to 1/2 gal. water.    Let sit for 4-5 days.  Be sure peppers stay submerged at all times.  Take  peppers out and rinse.  Pack in sterilized jar(s).    Bring to a boil: white vinegar, water, garlic, and salt.  Pour boiling  solution over peppers. Place one clove of garlic in each jar.  Add 1 tsp.  olive oil to each qt.   If you use pint jars, add 1/2 tsp.    She does not mention processing the peppers and the salt and vinegar would  probably preserve them, but to be safe, I would process them for 15 minutes  in a boiling water bath. If processed for 15 min. jars do not have to be  sterilized first.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #051    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
