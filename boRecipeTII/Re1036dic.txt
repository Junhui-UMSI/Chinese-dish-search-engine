Coconut-Rum Sauce
Coconut cream, milk, Egg yolks, White rum, Vanilla extract, 
In a medium saucepan, bring coconut cream and milk to a boil. In a bowl,  lightly beat the egg yolks. Gradually whisk the hot milk mixture into the  yolks. Return mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring  constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3  minutes. Strain into a bowl and cool. Stir in rum and vanilla.    Sauce can be prepared 2 days ahead and stored, covered, in the  refrigerator.    Recipe by Mangia!
