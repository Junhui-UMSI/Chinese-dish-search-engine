Pepper Sauce
See instructions, 
In a blender or food processor, process a bunch of fresh red chiles and a  few tomatillos. Fill a 1/2 gallon jug with the pulp. Make a mixture of 1  part cheap dry sherry and 1 part cider vinegar. Pour over pulp. Add a  little salt, and let mixture age for one year. Drain and strain the juice  and throw the pulp away. Use on greens, fish, beans, etc.    Judy Howle    Flavors of the South Recipes for "heat lovers" http://www.ebicom.net/~howle  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #336 by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on  May 26, 1997
