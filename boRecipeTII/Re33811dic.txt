Sweet and Sour Peppers with Almonds (Mandorlata Di Peperon
(about 3/4 lb.), Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Sugar, Salt, Quartered and deribbed, (1-1/2 oz.), Dark raisins (2 oz.), Red bell peppers, Quartered and deribbed, (about 1-1/4 lbs.), Green bell peppers, Slivered almonds, Red wine vinegar, 
1.  In a small bowl, soak the raisins in warm water for 20 minutes; drain  and set aside. 2. If you want to peel the peppers, cut the quartered  peppers in half lengthwise and flatten slightly. Peel the pieces with a  swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, then cut them lengthwise into 1/2-inch  strips. Alternatively, slice unpeeled peppers into 1/4-inch strips. 3. In a  large saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat.  Add the almonds and cook,  stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.  Add the raisins and cook for 1  minute, then stir in the peppers, sugar, vinegar and salt. Cover and cook  for 20 minutes.  Uncover and continue to cook until the peppers are very  tender and slightly glazed, 10 to 15 minutes longer. If the peppers begin  to stick to the pan, add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of warm water. Serve at room  temperature.  (This dish can also be made several hours ahead and reheated  just before serving.) This delicious and unusual pepper dish is from  Basilicata in the instep of the Italian boot. It is wonderful with grilled  meat, especially Italian sausages. Peeling the peppers without roasting  them first makes them particularly succulent, but peeling isnt mandatory.  The dish is delicious either way.
