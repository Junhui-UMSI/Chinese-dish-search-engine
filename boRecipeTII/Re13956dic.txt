1. Take your Chinese cleaver and chop through bone of chicken to form  chunks of chicken, about 2x2". Marinate all chicken chunks in wine,  soya sauce, salt for at least 20 minutes. In the meantime, slice all  the other ingredients and have ready for cooking.    2. If your wok is small, you will have to divide your chicken into 2  batches and cook each batch seperately. If your wok is large enough to  hold all the chicken, then place 4 tablespoons oil in it, heat to  smoking point, add all of the chicken and onions to it, stir fry and  brown chicken on all sides with wok uncovered. This will take about  10 minutes. At the end of this period, cover wok and cook chicken a  further 10 minutes.    3. Uncover wok, add clery, mushrooms, water chestnuts, stir everything  well. Cover wok and cook ingredients 3 minutes, uncovering wok, once  to give things a stir. Mix starch solution up well, add to wok, stir  everything up thoroughly.    NOTE: If your wok is small, cook the chicken in two batches. Remove  both batches of chicken to a serving platter. Leave chicken juices in  wok. Cook vegetables and make gravy in it. When vegetables and gravy  are cooked, pour over chicken. This dish can be used as a main dish  in Canadian cuisine, by not cutting up the chicken so fine.
