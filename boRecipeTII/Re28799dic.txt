Thai Chicken Coconut Soup
-TO, Chopped scallions, Cilantro (pref. fresh) *, Juice from (8?) limes, (the unsweetened kind), Coconut milk, Lemon grass, Serrano chillies, -TO, Tofu, Carrot; grated, Chicken, Mushrooms, Galanga powder, 
* (I sometimes leave this out.  Niels says thats defeating the whole  point, but I think it still comes out great)    Instructions: ============= Heat the coconut milk in a pot. Add everything  else.  As the lemon grass is inedible, put it in a tea ball and immerse the  ball in the soup so you can retrieve it later. Cook until the chicken is  done and the soup is hot (30 minutes?). Taste to see if it needs more limes  (it always does) or more hot peppers (its better to start mild and build  up to the desired level of spicyness).
