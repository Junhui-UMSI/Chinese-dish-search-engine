From J.R. Brimmer III    saute onions in olive oil. Add rice & brown lightly. Cook rice according to  directions with half the lemon juice. Add dill, mint, parsley, & pine nuts.  Rinse grape leaves in cold water.  Remove stems and place 1 tablespoon of  rice mixture on dull side folding in sides & rolling up leaves. Put in  10x13 pan, open end down.  Cover with remaining oil, lemon juice and enough  water to cover at least 1/2 the dolmathes. Cover with aluminum foil & place  in a 375F oven for 45 minutes. When cool stack on a plate, cover with  plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 day. Serve with lemon wedges.    Comment from JRB:  This recipe is similar to the cold Dolmathes   served at  the Parthenon Restaurant in Chicago.  There are 2  varieties, hot and cold.  I prefer the cold version.
