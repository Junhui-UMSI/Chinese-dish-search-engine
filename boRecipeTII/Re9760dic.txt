Pumpkin Seed Chicken Mole
Skinless, boneless chicken, Onion, Dried Mexican oregano, Radish tops, Salt, olive oil, Tomatillos, Chicken Stock, pumpkin seeds, Cumin seeds, Radishes, Romaine lettuce, Cilantro, Cracked black pepper, Ground cinnamon, Garlic, Serrano chile, 
In a dry cast-iron skillet toast pumpkin seeds, cumin seeds, pepper and  oregano over a low heat, shaking the pan occasionally. Heat until aromas  are released, about 5 minutes. Remove before seeds begin to brown and set  aside to cool. In a blender grind mixture until a powder forms. In blender  or food processor puree tomatillos, serrano chile, garlic, lettuce,  cinnamon, cilantro, radish tops, onion and salt until smooth. Preheat oven  to 350 degrees. In a large saucepan heat olive oil over a high heat.  Carefully, pour in pureed tomatillo mixture, and let sizzle for 30 seconds.  Stir in stock. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn up the heat to  high and bring to a boil. Stir in ground nut mixture and remove from the  heat. Puree in a food processor or blender, in batches, if necessary. Pass  through a fine strainer, pressing with the back of a ladle to extract all  the juices, into a 13 x 10-inch flameproof baking dish. Place the chicken  breasts in the sauce and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Cover with  foil and bake for 20 minutes. Serve the chicken and sauce over a bed of  white rice. Sprinkle radish slices over the top.
