Beat eggs, sugar, and vanilla together on 2nd speed with paddle attachment  for 10 minutes. Cut up butter into a small pot and melt over medium heat.  Add cocoa and stir well. Add cocoa mixture to eggs and sugar. Mix on 1st  speed for 30 seconds. Add flour to cocoa, egg and sugar mixture. Mix on 1st  speed for 30 seconds. Mixture will be thick. DO NOT OVERMIX! Preheat  convection oven to 350F. Pour mixture into a a greased 18 X 13 X 1 half  sheet pan for 48 servings. Carefully spread mixture with a rubber spatula  until batter is even in the pan. Place in the middle of the oven and bake  for 12 minutes. Take out of the oven and immediately let the sheet pan DROP  on a solid work table. This will ensure you of having a fudge type brownie.  Let Cool. Cut into 6 X 8 inch squares. Dust with confectioners sugar.    Notes: Everybody hates school cafeteria food, at least thats what we  say....at least the students do. Always complaining, watch them fight and  stuff their mouths with these tempting morsels. Im not even a brownie  lover, but these are something else. Truman makes them very thin, I dont  know whether this has something to do with texture and flavor or to make  them go farther, but these brownies turn out so moist and fudgy..almost  like candy.
