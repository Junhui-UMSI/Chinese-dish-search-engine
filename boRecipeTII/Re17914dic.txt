In large skillet or electric frying pan, heat oil and saute onions and  garlic until onions are golden. Add potatoes, eggplant, and mushrooms and  cook over medium-high heat ten minutes. Add tomatoes and all spices to  mixture along with 1 C. water. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally,  until veggies are cooked, about 30 to 40 minutes. You may need to add more  water or oil as it evaporates. Serve with warmed whole wheat tortillas. We  like to serve burrito style after spreading the tortilla with butter.
