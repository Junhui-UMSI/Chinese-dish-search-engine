Popover Shells
Butter or Margarine, Salt, All-purpose flour, Eggs, Sugar (optional), milk, 
This is a recipe that is from a Sunset cookbook It says "These fragile  shells are nothing but crisp golden crusts and tasty air. The egg batter  puffs as it bakes, forming hollow that you can fill with butter or  preserves, or something creamy and savory. For all their smashing good  looks, popovers are easy to make. Measure the few ingredients accurately  and avoid overbeating the batter, or the popovers wont rise as high. Once  theyre in the oven, resist the temptation to peek. Popovers will collapse  if a draft of air reaches them just as theyre swelling above the cup. You  can bake popovers in your choice of containers: lightweight metal muffin  pans; dark, heavy cast-iron popover pans; or ovenproof glass custard cups".    Preheat oven (see temperature below). Grease containers. In a bowl, stir  together flour, salt, and sugar (if used) until thoroughly blended. Add  butter, milk, and eggs. With an electric mixer, beat until very smooth  (about 2-1/2 minutes), scraping bowl frequently with a rubber spatula. Pour  into greased containers, filling each about half full. In ovenproof cups of  1/3 cup size, batter will yield 12 popovers; 1/2 cup size, 10 popovers; 6  oz. size, 6 or 7 popovers.    For a richly browned shell with fairly moist interior, bake on center rack  in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes or until well browned  and firm to touch. For a lighter colored popover, drier inside, bake in a  preheated 375 degree oven for 50 to 55 minutes. Remove from pans and serve  hot.
