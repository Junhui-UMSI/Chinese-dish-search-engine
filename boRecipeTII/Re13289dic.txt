Wyoming Whopper Cookies
Granulated sugar, Quick cooking**, (12 oz) chocolate chips, Baking soda, Beaten eggs, Old-fashioned oats - **not, Raisins, Butter, Chunky-style peanut butter*, Brown sugar, 
(*I use Jif brand peanut butter. If unavailable, use another brand,  but add several tablespoons water to mixture.) Melt butter over low  heat. Blend in sugars, eggs and peanut butter; mix until smooth. Add  oats, soda, raisins and chocolate chips (mixture will be sticky).  Drop on greased baking sheet with No. 20 ice cream scoop or large  spoon. Flatten slightly. Bake at 350 F for about 15 minutes for large  cookies, 3-in diameter. Remove to cooling rack.
