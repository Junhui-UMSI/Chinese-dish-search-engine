Idea from Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone by Deborah Madison (1997): "Baked  Eggplant with Feta Cheese and Tomatoes;" brown an uncooked eggplant, cut it  and toss with other ingredients: bake covered 375F about 40 minutes,  uncovered about 5 minutes.    NOTE: We made extra eggplant a few days before.
