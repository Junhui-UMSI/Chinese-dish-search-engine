Puree potato in a food processor until smooth; you should have 1/2 cup. Set  aside.    Preheat oven to 350F. Generously butter two 8-cup muffin tins, or line with  paper liners.    In large bowl, sift together dry ingredients.    In another bowl, cream butter and brown sugar together. Add eggs and beat  well. Then stir in remaining ingredients; mix thoroughly.    Make a well in center of dry ingredients; pour potato mixture into it. Stir  until ingredients are incorporated--do not overmix.
