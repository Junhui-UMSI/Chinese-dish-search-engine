Cook noodles according to package directions.  Drain well, and set aside.  Sauti onion and green pepper in butter in a Dutch oven until tender; add  flour, stirring until smooth.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until  thickened and bubbly.  Stir in noodles, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, poppy  seeds, salt, red pepper, and tofu; add pimiento, and stir gently. Spoon  mixture into a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish. Cover and  chill 8 hours.  To bake, remove from refrigerator, and let stand at room  temperature 30 min.  Bake, covered, at 350 for 45 min.  Uncover, and  sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese.  Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 min.  or until thoroughly heated.    1. I use one pound of tofu cut into 1 inch squares instead of turkey.  (I  am a vegitarian.)    2. It does not have to refrigerate, but the tastes do mingle better if it  does.    3. I usually sprinkle more than 2 tablespoons of cheese on top.
