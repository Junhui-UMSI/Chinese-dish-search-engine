Margarine; softened, Cinnamon, Margarine; melted, Sugar, Hot water (125-130), Almonds; sliced, Raisins, Yeast; rapid-rise, Flour; all-purpose, Salt, Coconut; flaked, Honey, 
Set aside 1 cup flour. Mix remaining flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in mixer  bowl. Stir in hot water and margarine. Add enough reserved flour to make  soft dough. Knead 4 minutes. Roll dough to 14 x 8" rectangle. Place on  greased baking sheet.    Spread filling down center third. Cut 1" wide  strips from sides of filling to dough edges. Alternately fold strips over  filling. Cover. Place boiling water in large shallow pan on counter. Place  baking sheet over pan and let dough rise for 15 min. Bake 20 min at 375 or  until done. Remove from sheet and cool on wire rack. Can drizzle with a  confectioners sugar glaze, if desired. Frans notes: on a hot, humid day,  I didnt need the extra cup of flour. I used a 12 oz can of solo almond  filling instead of the one listed here. I didnt have any 10x sugar, but a  glaze would have been nice.  Otherwise, Ill use a butter or egg wash to  pretty it up.  This is definitely a keeper and I cant wait to try  apricot, etc. filling.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
