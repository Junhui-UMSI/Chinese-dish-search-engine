Cut peeled eggs lengthways into halves. Carefully remove yolks and set  whites aside. In a small mixing bowl mash yolks and blend in sour cream,  mustard and salt. Fill whites with this yolk mixture. In a large iron  skillet melt butter until bubbling. saute green bell pepper, red bell  pepper and onion in butter until they just become tender (do not  over-saute). Remove from heat and stir in soup and sour cream. Spread  one-half the soup/sour cream mixture in the shallow baking dish (about  1-1/2 quart) and add eggs (cut side up) in single layer (the mixture, if  thick enough, will help somewhat keep the eggs from overturning, but if  some do, dont worry about it). Carefully pour remaining soup mixture over  top. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese and bake 20 minutes in oven at 350F  until heated thoroughly and cheese melts. Serves 6 to 8.
