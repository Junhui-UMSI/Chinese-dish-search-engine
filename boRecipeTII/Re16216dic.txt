Sugar, Warm water, Salt, Flour, Water, Cake yeast, 
Pour enough warm water in a large bowl. Dissolve yeast, then add sugar,  salt and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 10 minutes. Let rise  for 15 minutes. Flatten on a floured surface and roll to 1 inch thick. Cut  into strips 12 inches by 1 inch.    Roll each strip to 1/2" thick and cut in half. Pinch ends together and seal  to form a circle. Cover and let rise for 20 mintes. Preheat oven to 375F.  Put a little salt and sugar into the gallon of water and bring to a boil.  Boil 4 bagels at a time for 7 minutes per batch, turning over halfway  through the cooking. Remove with slotted spoon, and plae on an ungreased  baking sheet.    Sprinkle with poppy seeds, garlic, coarse salt, or chopped dried onion if  desired. Bake at 375F for 30 minutes.    Source: The Joys of Jewish Cooking.
