Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds.  Cook the squash (We put it  in the microwave, but she recommends baking it at 375 for 30-45 minutes. We  were afraid itd dry out too much that way.) When the squash is cooked and  cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh.    While the squash is baking, make an infusion with the herbs and milk: first  lightly crush the corriander seeds and peppercorns; then put them in a  saucepan with the milk, cinnamon, cloves, and chilies. Heat the mixture  slowly, but turn off the heat just before the milk comes to a boil Let it  stand until needed.    Saute the onions in water until they begin to soften. Add the squash and 1  qt. water.  Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer until the  squash is broken up, about 25 minutes.    Pass the soup through a food mill or blen it briefly, leaving as much  texture as you like.  Return the soup to the stove and add the milk,  pouring it through a strainer. Try to press on the spices as you do, to get  as much flavor into the soup as you can.  Gently reheat the soup, but do  not allow it to boil.  Serve garnished with cilantro and mint.
