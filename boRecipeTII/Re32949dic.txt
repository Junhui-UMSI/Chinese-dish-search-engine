Sweet Tomato Chutney
Peeled & coarsely chopped, 14oz  tins, Fresh tomatoes, peeled, Peeled and chopped, Salt, Whole head of garlic, "long, 1" thick and 1" wide, Piece fresh ginger, Red wine vinegar, To 1/2 t, Golden raisins, Blanched slivered almonds, Cayenne pepper, Granulated sugar, Whole tomatoes -- or, 
Put the chopped garlic, ginger and 4 fl. oz of the vinegar into the  container of an electric blender and blend at high speed until smooth.  In  a 3 quart heavy-bottomed non-reactive pot, place the tomatoes and juice  from the tin, the rest of the vinegar, the sugar, salt and cayenne pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Add puree from the blender.  Lower heat and simmer  gently, uncovered, for about 11/2 -2 hours or until thick.  Stir  occasionally at first, and more frequently later as it thickens. You should  end up with about 1 pint of chutney.  If tinned tomatoes are used, you may  have to cook the mixture longer. Add the almonds and raisins. Simmer,  stirring another 5 minutes.  Turn heat off and allow to cool. Bottle. Keep  refrigerated. This is actually more of a conserve - with the addition of  nuts to the mixture.  This recipe is from the cooking school I attended. I  put up chutneys every year - our family loves them - and they make great  Christmas Gifts . Chanteclar.
