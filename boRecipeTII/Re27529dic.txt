Thanksgiving Carrots
Butter, Carrots, dry rosemary leaves, Fresh Lemon Juice, Onion, salt and pepper, 
1. Boil small amount of water (about 1 1/2 cups) with rosemary in it (e.g.,  infuse rosemary). Let stand a couple of minutes. Strain & throw away  rosemary.    2. Put carrots (& salt to taste, if desired) in rosemary-seasoned water &  cook until tender (poke w. fork).    3. Meanwhile, saute onions in butter until tender. Add drained carrots,  lemon juice, salt & pepper. Serve.    (Note: slice carrots to thickness of your preference - we do about 1/4 "  inch - time it takes to cook carrots depends on thickness, 1/4-inch cooks  quite quickly)    NOTES : Typed & formatted by Holly Butman.
