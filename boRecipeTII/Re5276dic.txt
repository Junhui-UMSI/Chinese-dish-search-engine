from 365 Ways to Prepare for Christmas    Preheat oven to 325?.  Before starting batter, wash 8 (1-pint) wide-mouth  canning jars with lids in hot, soapy water and let them drain, dry and cool  to room temperature.  Generously grease inside of jars (I?ve used PAM).    Drain crushed pineapple for about 10 minutes reserving juice.  Puree  drained pineapple in a food processor. Measure out 1 1/2 cups puree, adding  a little juice if necessary to make 1 1/2 cups. Set puree aside. Discard  remaining juice or save for another use.    With an electric mixer, beat together butter and half of brown sugar until  light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs, then remaining sugar.  Beat in pineapple  puree and run and set aside.    Sift together flour, baking powder, and baking soda.  Gradually add to  pineapple mixture in thirds, beating well after each addition to make a  thick batter. Stir in coconut.    Spoon 1 level cupful of batter into each jar.  Carefully wipe rims clean,  then place jars in center of preheated oven.  Bake 40 minutes.    About 10 minutes before the cakes are done, bring a medium saucepan of  water to boil. Put in jar lids, cover and remove from heat. Keep lids in  hot water until they are used.    When cakes are done, remove jars from over.  If jar rims need cleaning, use  a moistened paper towel. Carefully put lids and rings in place, then screw  tops tightly shut.  Place jars on a wire rack; they will seal as they cool.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 24 October 96    Date:    Fri, 25 Oct 1996 13:00:22 -0400    From:    Gloria Rodrigues <GRODRIGUES@AOL.COM>
