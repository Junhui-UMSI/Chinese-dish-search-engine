Pignoli Biscotti
Lemon zest, Pine nuts, Eggs, Butter, Flour, Salt, Lemon juice, Sugar, Flour, Baking Powder, 
Place nuts in pan and bake in 350F. oven 4-5 minutes. Stir  occasionally, checking to see that nuts dont burn. Let cool.    In a bowl, beat butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs, lemon  juice and zest. Batter will look curdled, but dont worry. Combine  flour, baking powder and salt and stir into creamed mixture until  blended. Mix in nuts.    Divide dough in half. On a greased and floured baking sheet, pat out  the dough into 2 logs, 1/2" high, and inch and a half wide and 14"  long. Bake in a 325F. oven 25 minutes and let cool on rack 5 minutes.    Place on a cutting board and cut diagonally into 1/2" thick slices.  Lay slices flat on baking sheet and return to oven for 10-15 minutes  to dry slightly, turning once. Makes 3 1/2 to 4 dozen cookies.
