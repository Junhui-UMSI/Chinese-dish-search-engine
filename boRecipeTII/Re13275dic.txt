WW I Ration War Cake - No Eggs, Butter or Mil
Brown sugar, Shortening, All-purpose flour, Salt, Ground nutmeg, Raisins, cinnamon, Baking soda, dates, 
This could be called a heavy fruitcake. Boil sugar, shortening, raisins,  dates, salt and spices for 3 min. Remove from heat and let cool. When cool,  add flour and baking soda that have veen sifted together; beat well. Pour  into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan and bake at 350 degrees for 45 min.    This was a VERY popular recipe at the Oakland Navy yard during the era. And  what I find amusing...it is a good recipe to make for camping trips today.  There isnt much in it to spoil. You could even make this on your upcoming  camping trip!
