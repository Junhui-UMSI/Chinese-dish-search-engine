The name seems to be a variation of -pozo-, Spanish for     "puddle," and in Mexico the dish is spelled -pozole-.    Cook first 6 ingredients over medium heat for 3 hr or until posole is  tender. Add water as necessary. Add pork and cook 1/2 hr or until  tender. Serve in soup bowls, accompanied by soft tortillas.    Soak the 8 chiles in hot water for 15 min. Put chiles and 1 c of the  water and the garlic powder in a blender and blend until smooth.  Serve in a bowl on the side. Serve the onion and cilantro in bowls on  the side.
