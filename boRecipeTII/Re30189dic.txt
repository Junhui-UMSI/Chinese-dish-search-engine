Recipe by: Nabisco 100% Bran Cereal Box Heres my recipe adapted from a  recipe on the Nabisco 100% Bran cereal box. This makes a very dense and  heavy muffin just the way I like it. If you prefer a lighter muffin than  just add all-purpose flour for some or part of the whole wheat flour.    Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in large    bowl.  Beat egg in medium bowl, stir in bananas, cereal, water, applesauce,  vanilla, and honey.  Add to flour mixture. Stir JUST UNTIL MOISTENED!  (Batter will be lumpy.) Fill muffin tin. Makes 12 average size muffins.    Bake at 400 F. for 18-22 min.    A good variation that I have tried is using pureed peaches instead of  bananas.  You might have to cut back on the water a little for that  depending on how juicy your peaches are. When I add peaches I also like to  add a little extra nutmeg.  Maybe I should try this with rhubarb. I know I  would have to increase the honey quite a bit!  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #53    Date: Tue, 15 Oct 1996 23:03:58 -0800    From: "Jenny S.
