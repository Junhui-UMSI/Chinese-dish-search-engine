We are suffering from the drought down here in Texas, but you  wouldnt know it from all the cucumbers in my garden. Heres a great recipe  Ive adapted from the Consumers Guide "Wok Cooking Class Cookbook" :    Cut the cucumbers lengthwise into halves. Scoop out any large seeds and  discard. Cut the halves several times to obtain 2-inch-long strips of  whatever thickness you prefer.    Crush the garlic clove lightly with the flat side of a knife. Heat the  water or broth in a wok at a high temperature with the garlic and dried  chili peppers until the peppers are dark red. Add the cucumbers to the  flavored water/broth and stir-fry until the skin is bright green, about 1  minute. Drizzle with the soy sauce and sprinkle with the sugar; stir-fry  until the sugar melts, about 5 seconds (dont let it burn). Transfer to a  bowl, sprinkle with the salt and stir. Remove the garlic and dried peppers  and discard them.    Cut the ginger and chili pepper lengthwise into long shreds. Stir-fry with  the sesame oil and a little more broth/water if needed for about 30  seconds. Add the vinegar to the cucumbers and toss with the ginger and  chili pepper mixture. Serve hot or cold, 3 to 4 servings.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #165    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
