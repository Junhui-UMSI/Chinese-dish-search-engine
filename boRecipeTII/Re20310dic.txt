Veal Parmigiana
cheese, Olive oil, Eggs, Veal Cutlets, Dry bread crumbs (seasoned), 
*(can be used for chicken, turkey, or fish fillets) Dip each cutlet into  egg, breadcrumbs, and quickly into egg again. Put into hot, but not smoking  olive oil. (If oil is too hot cutlets will burn before they cook; if oil is  not hot enough, cutlets will soak up oil and breading will not stick.) Cook  each one about 3-4 min. on each side until golden brown. Drain well on  paper towels or brown bags. When all cutlets are done, arrange in a shallow  baking dish. Ladle sauce on top of each one to mostly cover it, but don`t  let it swim in sauce. Generously sprinkle with grated cheese. Top with  mozzarella slices and bake in oven for about 20 min. until cheese melts.  Serve hot with pasta on the side.
