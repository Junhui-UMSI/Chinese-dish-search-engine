Chorizo
(about 3 oz. total) dried, Red wine vinegar, Sized onion; quartered, Ground pork, Cloves garlic; minced or, Salt, Dry oregano leaves, Each ground cumin and ground, 
One of my own recipes for Mexican style chorizo can be found within my  collection of webpages at    http://members.cts.com/crash/m/macknet/sausage.html    along with a recipe for Tolucan style chorizo. Not being a recipe follower,  I generally start out with my recipe in mind and wing it from there. I let  what Ive made sit in the fridge overnight and then cook up a small patty  the next morning to see if I need to adjust the spices or add  something...sort of a trial by taste method. I usually make it as bulk  sausage rather than stuff it in casings cause most of the ways I use it  (huevos con chorizo, chorizo y papas, frijoles de olla con chorizo, and  such) calls for removing the casing, crumbling it and sauteing it along  with some chopped chiles n onions.    Soak chiles in vinegar until soft (3 hours). Remove stems and seeds. Place  chiles, vinegar, and onion in a blender, whirl until smooth.    In a large bowl, combine chile puree, pork, garlic, salt, oregano, cumin,  and ground red pepper, mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours  or until next day.
