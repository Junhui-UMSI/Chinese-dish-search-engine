Every afternoon at about 4:45, a piping hot batch emerges from our  ovens and is sent out to the bar, where the sweet rosemary fragrance wafts  throughout the restaurant. Though we dont have a television set at our  bar, these nuts would probably be a hit in your living room accompanied by  a football game and some ice-cold beer.
