Banana Pancakes
milk, Salt, Flour, Sugar, Butter, Baking Powder, Eggs, Bananas, 
1.  In large bowl, mix 4 dry ingredients and make well in centre.    2.  In separate bowl, beat eggs, then mix in butter and milk.  Pour into  flour mixture and stir to moisten (dont worry about lumps).  Add more milk  or flour to make thinner or thicker pancakes.  Fold in banana.    3.  Drop by tbsp on oiled 380F (190C) pan, hot enough that water droplets  bounce.    Bananas will turn brown as pancakes cool, but will not affect taste.  Do  not freze.    My notes:  These are wonderful and the banana taste comes through well.  Do  not make too large or overcook.
