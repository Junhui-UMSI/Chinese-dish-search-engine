CUT THE CHICKEN INTO 1-INCH cubes. Put the cubes into a bowl together with  the rice wine or sherry, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon  salt, and marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the green and red peppers  into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrots and scallions into 1-inch  chunks. (The uniform size of meat and vegetables adds to the visual appeal  of the dish.) Bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the carrots in it  for 4 minutes, then drain and set aside. Mix the egg and cornstarch in a  bowl until they are well blended into a batter. Lift the chicken cubes out  of the marinade, put them into a batter and coat each piece well. Heat the  oil in a deep-fat fryer or large wok until it is almost smoking. Remove the  chicken pieces from the batter with a slotted spoon and deep-fry them.  Drain the deep-fried chicken cubes on paper towels.    TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce, salt, vinegar,  sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it to a boil. Add all the  vegetables, but not the lychees or oranges, and stir well. In a small bowl,  blend together the cornstarch and water. Stir this mixture into the sauce,  and bring it back to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer. Add the  lychees or oranges and chicken cubes. Mix well, then turn the mixture onto  a deep platter. Serve at once.
