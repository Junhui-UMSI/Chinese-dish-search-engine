This is good with leftover Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey. I have made a  couple of changes to original. Its really easy. I tried this first after  Thanksgiving 1994. At first I didnt think it would be very good, but it  turned out nicely. Ross (my husband)thinks there is "something missing" but  he doesnt know what.    Melt margarine in stovetop safe casserole dish.* Stir in the celery,  onions, mushrooms, and peppers and saute gently until browned. Sprinkle  flour over top, stir in and cook slowly 5 minutes. Stir chicken broth in  gradually. Remove pot from heat and stir in egg yolks. Add turkey meat.  Season to taste (salt, white pepper, garlic salt). Add white wine. Stir  over low heat until turkey is heated through and sauce is thickened. Remove  from heat. Sprinkle grated cheese on top.    To reduce the fat in this dish, either reduce the margarine or cook the  vegetables in Butter Buds.    Serve at once over rice  Source: Joy of Cooking Page(s): 235 Date Published: 1964  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n150    From: "Lou B.
