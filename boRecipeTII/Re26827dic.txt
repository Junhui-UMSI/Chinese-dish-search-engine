From: elisa@netcom.com (Elisa Enison)    Date: Thu, 11 Jul 1996 12:50:19 -0700  Place bananas (IN PEEL) on aluminum foil covered baking sheet bake for  20-30 minutes @ 350 degrees or until peel becomes black. Remove from skin  and place in dish. Top with a dollop of whipped topping.    This is especially good if the bananas are ripe.   Bananas come out almost  tasting as if liquer has been added.
