di2@delphi.com (Diana Rattray) (you can use an extra pound of pork instead  of the tripe.) - Chop, do not grind the meat. Mix with seasonings. Stuff  into casings. Age at least overnight and then smoke several hours using  hickory, hackberry or ash. (Do not use pine.) Throw anything sweet, such as  cane sugar or syrup, raw sugar, molassess, sugar cane or brown sugar on the  wood before lighting.
