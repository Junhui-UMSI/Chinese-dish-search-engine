Sweet Potato Gratin with Honey and Orange
Half and half, Sweet potatoes, peeled,, Salt, Brown Sugar, Coriander, Orange Peel, Ground ginger, Orange juice, Butter, Honey, 
I have made this dish for several Thanksgiving dinners and, without fail,  whenever I dont make it, people ask where it is.    Preheat oven to 350F. Butter a 13"x9"x2" baking dish. Bring to a boil, the  orange juice, half and half, brown sugar, butter, grated orange peel,  corainder, salt, and ground ginger to boil in heavy large skillet over high  heat, stirring constantly. Mix in the grated sweet potatoes. Spoon sweet  potato mixture into prepared baking dish. Cover tightly with foil wrap.  Bake for 40 minutes, then uncover and mix well. Cover with foil wrap again  and return to the oven for 40 minutes more. Remove from oven and drizzle 3  tbsp honey over the potatoes. Return to oven, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Serve hot.
