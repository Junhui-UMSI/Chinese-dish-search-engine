Pineapple Puff Hawaii
Rum extract, Crushed pineapple in juice, Drain well, Brown sugar, Bread slices -- thick, Margarine -- melted, Eggs -- beaten, 
Drain the crushed pineapple, cube the bread and combine the two  ingredients. (Use a sweetened challah-type bread if preferred.) Place this  mixture into a 1-1/2 quart baking dish that has been greased with solid  margarine. Beat the eggs well and add the melted margarine, sugar and rum  extract. Stir to blend, then pour this mixture over the bread and pineapple  mix. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for about 40 minutes. This dessert  will puff and turn golden brown. Serve immediately.
