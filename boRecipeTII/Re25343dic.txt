Lynns notes: Made this  2-24-98; doubled the amount of tortellini, beef and onion; used 1-1/2 jars  Ragu hearty garlic and onion sauce, mixed together the beef mixture,  tortellini and added 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella and dumped it all into a  sprayed 9x13" pan, topped with parmesan cheese. Did that early in the day  and heated in the microwave on high for 15 minutes at dinnertime. This was  a terrific dish and easy to make.
