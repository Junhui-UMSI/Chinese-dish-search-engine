Filling: In a large saucepan, bring vegetable broth to a boil over  medium-high heat. Add potatoes, cover and cook 5 minutes. Add carrots,  onions, and celery. Cover and cook 3 minutes. Add peas and-or corn and  mushrooms. Cover and cook 2 minutes or until tender.    Combine flour, pepper and poultry seasoning. Add soy milk or water and  beat together well. Gradually add to vegetable mixture, stirring well.  Over medium-high heat, stir constantly for about 3 minutes, or until  mixture is thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat, stir in tofu, and  salt to taste.    To assemble: Heat oven to 350F. Roll out dough to fit over the top  of a 9" square casserole dish.
