cook brown rice as you would normally cook brown rice, and allow to cool.    simmer onions and herbs in water until onions are soft.  remove bay leaves.  save any broth.    soak shiitake mushrooms in water until they soften.  simmer *all* mushrooms  in mushroom water until the fresh mushrooms are cooked through.  save  mushroom sweat.    in a food processor, process 1/2 of the rice, 2 c. of the oats, and all of  the other ingredients until there are no big chunks.  You may have to do  two batches depending on the size of your food processor.  Use mushroom  water and onion liquid to keep the food processor happy.    in a large bowl, mix the processed gloop with remaining rice and oats.  It  should be thick enough to form into cohesive patties, but not dry.  Add a  few extra oats if its too wet, or some liquid if your hands dont get a  little sticky when handling it.    fry in a light spray of Pam, over low heat, until both sides of the patty  are brown and crunchy.  about 10 min.    using a larger amount of mushrooms makes it taste even better, but then the  batter becomes more like thick pancake batter.  Still yummy though.    Cynthia Gibas, cgibas@silibio.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10  Issue 36], Sept. 16, 1994. Formatted by Sue Smith, S.Smith34,  TXFT40A@Prodigy.com using MMCONV.
