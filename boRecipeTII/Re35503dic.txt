Recipe by: Better Homes & Gardens, April 1992 Using a small melon baller,  scoop the cantaloupe and the honeydew into balls, or use a knife to cut  melon into cubes. You should have about 4 cups cantaloupe and 2 cups  honeydew. Set aside 2 cups of the cantaloupe. In a small saucepan, combine  pineapple juice, sugar and ginger root. Bring to boiling, stirring until  sugar is dissolved. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, over medium heat for 5  to 7 minutes, or until the mixture is the consistency of a thin syrup.  Remove from heat; cool. Transfer syrup to a storage container; add 2 cups  cantaloupe pieces and 2 cups honeydew pieces. Cover and chill overnight.  Meanwhile, place strawberries in a blender container or a food processor  bowl; cover and process until smooth. Remove and set aside. Repeat with the  reserved 2 cups cantaloupe pieces. In a large bowl, stir together the  yogurt and sour cream. Add strawberries, blended melon and milk; stir until  combined. Cover and chill overnight. To serve, drain melon balls, reserving  syrup. Stir reserved syrup into chilled soup. Ladle soup into bowls; top  with melon balls. If desired, garnish with carnation petals.
