Venison Tid-Bits
Venison, Worcestershire Sauce, Water, Lots of black pepper, Bacon, Salt, 
Cut pieces of venison into one inch squares. Take a slice of bacon; cut  into halves lengthwise and thirds crosswise (just long enough to wrap  around the meat). Secure with a toothpick. Make about two dozen. Put in a  cast iron skillet. Add ingredients as listed above. Boil rapidly until  water is nearly gone. Reduce heat and cover skillet. Continue cooking at  lower temperature until meat is brown. The meat will be very rich.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
