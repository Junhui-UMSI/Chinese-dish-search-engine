In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine the  raspberries, sugar, Chambord, and lemon juice. Process the mixture for 30  to 45 seconds, or until smooth. Strain the pur?e through a fine-meshed  sieve into a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at  least 1 hour, until chilled.    Assemble the sundaes:    1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the  wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at medium-high  speed until slightly stiff peaks begin to form. Transfer the cream to a  pastry bag fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #7) and refrigerate the  cream until ready to use.    2. Spoon about l 1/2 tablespoons of the raspberry sauce into the bottom of  a large sundae glass. Add 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 amaretti  cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Place a  small scoop of the raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream on top of the  cookie layer. Drizzle about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chocolate syrup over  the scoop. Top with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a drizzle of  raspberry sauce and 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 more amaretti  cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Top with a  scoop of raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with some of the  raspberry sauce. Pipe a large rosette of whipped cream on top of the sundae  and garnish with fresh raspberries and an amaretti    cookie. Repeat this procedure to make 4 sundaes. Serve immediately.          4    servings.    Recipe By     : webmaster@godiva.  com
