Shred the cabbage and put it into a large mixing bowl.  Peel and finely  chop the onion and add it to the cabbage. Cut the parsnip and apple into  small pieces, peeling them first if you wish, and add them to the bowl.    Drizzle on the honey.  Add a good seasoning of salt and pepper and scant  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds. Sprinkle on the vinegar , use 3 tablespoons if  the apple you are using is the dessert variety, just 2 tablespoons if it is  a cooking apple. Mix everything together well using your hands -- a little  messy, but spoons are not as effective -- then pile the mixture into a  buttered casserole.  Lay a sheet of thickly buttered greaseproof paper  directly on top of the vegetables and cover the casserole with a well  fitting lid to prevent drying out.    Cook at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for about 2-1/2 hours until the vegetables  are beautifully tender, if possible stir the mixture once or twice as it  cooks.  Remove the greaseproof paper and check seasoning immediately before  serving.  Serve the vegetable mixture just as it is, or top at the last  minute with 1/4 pint cold creamy yoghurt or soured cream into which you  have stirred a few bruised and lightly crushed caraway seeds. Or hand round  the bowl of flavoured cream separately, so that those who want it can help  themselves.    Source: Philippa Davenport in "Country Living" (British), May 1987.
