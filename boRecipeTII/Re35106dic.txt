Beau Monde Marinade
Onion; chunked up, Kitchen bouquet, Spice islands beau monde, Soy sauce, Cloves garlic; peeled, 
Put it all in a blender or food processor and blend to a mush. Put in a  tightly covered glass jar (two reasons: you need to shake it before using,  and its pungent). It will keep almost forever in the fridge and is good on  steaks, pork or lamb chops, or to marinate less tender cuts of meat for  shish kebob. My favorite is a Spencer (Rib Eye) steak, marinated for about  a day in this marinade. Bill formatted for MM by Norma Wrenn npxr56b  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1066 by "M.
