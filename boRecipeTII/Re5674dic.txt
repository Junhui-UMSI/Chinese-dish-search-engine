Date: 10 Mar 96 10:15:06 EST    From: Karen Snyder <100130.1562@compuserve.com>  I made this recipe this weekend to bring as dessert when I was invited for  dinner, and it was wonderful. SAD and non-SAD people alike love it. It came  from a magazine, but I dont know which one, because I only have the  cut-out recipe. Note that this must be prepared several hours in advance or  the night before, to give the flavors time to develop. SEVERAL HOURS  BEFOREHAND, OR THE NIGHT BEFORE:    1. Set aside 4-6 strawberries, depending on the size. In food processor or  blender, process the remaining strawberries, ginger root, lime peel, and  sugar till smooth.    2. Quarter the reserved strawberries. In a serving bowl, combine the  quartered strawberries with the pineapple chunks. Pour the strawberry sauce  over the mixture, and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or  overnight, stirring occasionally. Makes 4 servings, each serving: about 90  calories, 1g fat, 2 mg sodium. Sorry, the magazine did not provide the  sugar grams.    Notes:    1. I tasted the strawberry sauce and then adjusted the amount of lime and  ginger accordingly, using more than called for in the recipe    2. I added chopped kiwis to the pineapple.    3. The original recipe called for 2 tablespoons sugar, which seemed like  way too much to me, so I started with 1/2 tablespoon, which was fine.    4. Before adding the strawberry sauce, I poured 2 tablespoons of vodka and  2 tablespoons of Cassis (black currant liqueur) over the fruit.
