"Heres a recipe worthy of dinner parties, even with SAD invitees. Theyll  never miss the meat--or the cheese.  This is from Cooking Light magazine,  and Im giving you my adaptation because my version is a little faster.  Sorry its a little long."    "This is **outstanding** and well worth the time.  The flavor is  *fantastic*! We served it the other evening to my husbands new boss, and  he loved it."    Saute onion and garlic in nonstick skillet in a tsp of water or broth 4  minutes or until browned.  Place in food processor with red peppers, bread  crumbs, vinegar, salt, red and black pepper, and liquid smoke.  Process  until smooth. Set aside.    If you have time, broil the zucchini slices until blackened.  If not,  microwave a few minutes until crisp-tender and then pour onto paper towel  to blot excess moisture. Broil the tomato slices until blackened (they  taste better that way, and the process evaporates the excess juice).  Arrange 3 noodles in the bottom of an 11" x 7" baking dish coated with  cooking spray. Top with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the tomatoes,  1/4 c. of fresh basil, and about 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat layers. Finish  with a layer of noodles, then top with rest of sauce. (You can make ahead  to this point; cover and refrigerate until ready to bake.)    50 minutes before serving, cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 30  minutes.  Uncover, bake 10 minutes more.  Let stand 10 minutes before  serving.  Garnish with a couple of nice basil sprigs.  Makes 6 servings.
