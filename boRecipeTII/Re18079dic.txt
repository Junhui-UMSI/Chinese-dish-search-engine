From: GODgal@aol.com    Date: Thu, 8 Aug 1996 22:21:04 -0400  Also, I created a very yummy breakfast sandwich which is vlf (ovo-lacto). I  served this to my parents who would never eat anything vegetarian (or  lowfat) and they loved it!    Nuke garden sausage for 20 seconds on each side.  Place patty in a nonstick  pan (spray w/Pam) on medium heat.  Break patty up and saute for a few  minutes. You can add chopped onions & peppers or other veggies if youd  like.  Add egg beaters & cook until set. Break up ff cheese into pieces and  add to eggbeater/s**sage mixture. When melted, divide mixture between  toasted english muffins or bagels.
