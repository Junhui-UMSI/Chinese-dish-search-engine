This next recipe is from a book called "Juedische Kueche" (Jewish cooking).  I just have the xeroxed page, so I cant give the authors name. The book  states that these green pancakes come from the region between Pakistan and  Iran. They are eaten alone with yogurt or sour cream, or as a side dish  with hot curries.    Note that you need a food processor (i.e. Cuisinart) for this recipe.    In the food processor, puree the spinach/watercress/Swiss chard, with the  fresh herbs and leeks/scallions until thoroughly mixed together. Put into a  large bowl, and add the eggs nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste. Fold in  the matzoh meal. The batter should be fairly thick. Heat oil in a large  frying pan, over high heat. Drop tablespoonfuls of the batter in the heated  oil, and fry about 2 minutes or until the underside is light brown, then  turn and fry another 2 minutes or until the other side is light brown.  Drain on paper towels. Garnish with coriander/dill if desired, and eat with  yogurt/sour cream.
