Pessah Breakfast Boumuelos
Salt (up to 1/2), Matzos (up to 5), Eggs (up to 2), Oil to deep fry, 
My grand- mother Venoutcha Covo nee Benaroyo,fled Bulgaria with my father  and grand-father during ww2 to Tehran. They travelled with 2 heavy truncks,  in one of them, was the famous Bourmoulikous-pan. Actually those pans are  used to prepare 6 fried eggs at once, one in each hollow.    Simple to prepare, these bimuelos are traditionaly served in our familly.  Soak matzot, broken in very small pieces, during night. In the morning,  squeeze out as much water as possible. In a bowl, mix well with the eggs  and salt. Pour oil in the frying pan, form matzo mixture with a Tspoon into  round shape. Drop in hot oil and brown on both sides.    Serve with sugar hot syrup (sugar boiled with water).    The blue enamel pan, was abandoned,when my parents fled the Ayatollahs  regim.
