The article quotes;- "Turkish Jews have inumerable variations of turnovers  both as sweets and savories. Here, personal preference indicates whether  one should use walnuts or almonds or half of each. The borekas are a  popular sweet for Purim and can be prepared in large quantities to be  frozen after baking. Let them thaw out for onr hour befor gently warming in  the oven."    1. Mix all the pastry ingredients (except for the egg yolk mixed with  water) together and prepare the pastry. Knead well for a soft, manageable  dough, adding enough flour to produce the proper consistency. Cover and set  aside. Mix stuffing ingredients together throroughly.    2. Roll out about 1 heaping tablespoon of the pastry on a lightly floured  board to 3 or 4 inches in diameter for each boreka. Put 1 tablespoon of the  nut mixture on the bottom half of each pastry round. Fold the top over to  shape a half-moon. Press down firmly with thei tines of a fork to seal.  Paint the surface of each boreka with the egg yolk and water mixture.    3. Put borekas on an ungreased baking sheet and bake in a 350* F. oven for  1/2 hour, or until lightly brown.    Serve at room temperature with tea or coffee.    Makes about 20.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #057 by alotzkar@direct.ca (Al) on Jan 18,  1904.
