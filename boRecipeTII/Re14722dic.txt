1.  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Brush one side of the bread slices with some  of the olive oil and arrange on a baking sheet oiled side up. Bake until  lightly browned and crusty, about 4 minutes. 2. Spread the olivada or  chopped olives on each toast, cover each with a slice of mozzarella and top  with a slice of tomato.  Brush the tomatoes with the remaining oil and  sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Bake until the cheese is melted, about 8  to 10 minutes.  Serve at once.    * Olivada is a puree of black or green olives packed in oil that is sold at  specialty food stores.  You can substitute tapenade or make your own. (Note  from me:  We have a batch of pesto in the refrigerator so I plan to use it  instead of the olivada.)  I also plan to use Creole or homegrown tomatoes.
