"Tis like a visit with a friend to use her recipe"    From the Kitchen of Norma Bean, Cozad Nebraska (Janets Sister)    Formatted for MealMaster by Janet Newcomer, Dec 1996.    Normas comment: I really do enjoy this recipe and it freezes well.  I  check for doneness after 5-6 hours and adjust accordingly, turning to low.
