Aubergine Ginger-Soy Salad Dressing
Sugar, Soy sauce, Red wine vinegar, Vegetable oil, Pickled ginger, Chopped fresh parsley, 
This recipe comes from the February 1998 copy of Yankee magazine. It is  very good, and going to become one of our favorites.    This lively dressing goes well with flavorful greens such as watercress,  arugula, and mizuna, as well as mixed lettuces. Its also tasty as a  marinade for cooked vegetables, including beets, carrots, and broccoli.    1. Place all ingredients in blender and process for 1 minute.    2. refrigerate, covered, until chilled, about 1 hour.    3. Toss with salad and serve.
