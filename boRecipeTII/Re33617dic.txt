Swedish Nuts
Butter, unsalted, Pecan halves, Cinnamon, ground, Eggs whites, Sugar, granulated, Vanilla extract, Salt, 
Set aside stick of butter to melt in a long pan. (Dont use a pan that has  depressions around the side, such as for lasagna.) Preheat oven to 300  degrees.    Separate eggs; sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the egg whites. (You can  reserve the yolks to make custards.) Beat the whites to form soft peaks.  Gradually add the sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract. Fold in pecan  halves.    Turn out pecans and spread OVER the melted butter (dont stir them in).  Cook for 15 minutes.  Take out the pan and stir the nuts. Cook another 10  minutes, take out and stir. Repeat until the nuts are separated and all the  butter is absorbed (a little over one hour).    BE PATIENT!!!  For a long time it will look totally disgusting and you will  be sure I gave you a bogus recipe, but it works! Theoretically you can use  other nuts, but Ive tried both almonds and walnuts and was disappointed...
