Set aside. In a  large bowl, combine the cottage cheese with the eggs, butter, and vanilla.  Mix until well blended and smooth. Add the dry mixture and blend well. Pour  the mixture into the prepared crust and set the cake aside. Prepare the  topping by sifting the flour, sugar, and cinnamon together. Add the brown  sugar and blend well. Pour the melted butter over the topping mix and  immediately stir with a fork to form small crumbs. Sprinkle the topping mix  over the surface of the cake and bake the cake for 50 minutes, or until  done. Cool to room temperature and then chill.
