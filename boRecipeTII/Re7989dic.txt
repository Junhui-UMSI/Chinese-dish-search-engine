Melt  butter in skillet; saute carrots and onions until onions are golden; add  leeks and lettuce; simmer on low for 10 minutes.  Stir vegetable mixture  into soup; add sugar and salt. Simmer until split peas are tender, about 2  hours. Put fresh peas through a sieve. Force soup mixture through a sieve,  also. Return this combined mixture to the kettle. Stir in cream and milk.  Heat just to boiling; stirring occassionally to prevent scorching. Just  before serving, add butter. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream, a dash of  sherry, or both. Elegant!
