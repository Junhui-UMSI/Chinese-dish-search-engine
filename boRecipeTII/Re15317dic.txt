FILLING:    In a food processor, blend one cup cooked white beans with virgin olive  oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, grated Parmesan cheese, egg and parsley  until smooth (about 1 minute). Remove to medium mixing bowl and stir in  remaining cup of beans. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    ASSEMBLY:    Lay out 1 sheet of pasta and cut into 8 pieces, 3 1/2-inches by 3  1/2-inches. Place 1 1/2 tablespoons filling in center of each square and  fold corner to corner to form triangle shaped pillow. Press edge firmly  around to seal. Continue with all remaining pasta. Should yield 32 ravioli.  These can be set aside on a baking tray in refrigerator for 6 hours,  separated by a kitchen towel.    TO COOK:    Bring 6 quarts water to boil in a large spaghetti pot and add 2 tablespoons  salt. Drop ravioli into water and return to boil. Lower heat slightly and  cook just below boiling for 3 minutes.    Meanwhile, place sweet butter in 10-inch to 12-inch saute pan and cook  until foam subsides and butter begins to brown. Turn off heat and add  remaining 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (careful: it will spatter). Remove  ravioli from cooking liquid with spider and place in pan with butter and  vinegar. Toss over medium heat and sprinkle with remaining cheese and  parsley. Divide among 4 plates and serve immediately.
