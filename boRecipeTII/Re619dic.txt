The original gazpacho was created in the Andalusion region of Spain as a  cooling mid-afternoon snack for the men as they labored in the fields. It  is a classic dish, cooling, tart and tangy. This variation of it uses a  base of green vegetables and is equally as refreshing, whether you are  tilling the land or just tending your herbs. If you can find unwaxed or  English cucumbers, then please leave the skin on, for it adds great flavor,  color and texture.    This recipe can be served either with the vivid green vegetables shining  through the clear broth, or you may choose to stir in a spoonful of yogurt  at the end, giving the soup a light, opaque quality, and a slightly  different tanginess. I enjoy it both ways and suggest you pass the yogurt  separately, letting your guests decide for themselves which version they  prefer.    1. Rough cut the cucumber, zucchini, green onions and bell pepper into  large pieces, about 1 to 2 inches in size.    2. Drop the garlic and jalapeno into a food processor with the blade  running. Turn off the motor and add the cucumber, zucchini, green onions,  bell pepper, cilantro, salt and white pepper. Pulse until the ingredients  are chopped into a rough blend. The pieces should be 1/4 to 1/2-inch in  size.    3. In a large serving bowl, stir together the broth, olive oil and vinegar  until well blended. Mix in the vegetables. Chill. Serve garnished with a  dollop of yogurt, if desired, and coarsely chopped tomato.    (c)1997, Katherine Heyhoe.
