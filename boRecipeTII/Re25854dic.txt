Cut the fish into 2-inch pieces. Place the pieces in  cold water to cover, bring to boil, and drain well. Chop the onions and  garlic and fry them, along with the drained pimentos, in olive oil. When  vegetables are tender stir in the tomato sauce, parsley and wine. Cover and  simmer over very low heat for 30 minutes. Place the cod in the sauce and  simmer, uncovered, 30 to 45 minutes, or until the fish flakes easily.  Serves 4.
