Petula Clarks Pot De Creme Au Chocolate
Whipped cream, milk, Egg yolks, Sweet chocolate, 
Combine the milk and chocolate in a small saucepan and stir  constantly over a low heat until the chocolate is melted and the  mixture has reached the boiling point.  Beat the egg yolks until they  are thick and lemon colored; then mix the chocolate into the yolks.  Make sure that the chocolate has cooled a little; otherwise, the eggs  will scramble. Pour into six dessert dishes and cool. Top each with a  dab of whipped cream before serving.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
