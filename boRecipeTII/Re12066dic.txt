*NOTE:  This is the whispy stuff at the top of the stem.  I dont know what  the proper term for it is so I just call it the whispy stuff. **NOTE: The  original recipe used the Parmesan cheese to put on top when the pasta is  plated and served.  I omitted it completely.    Chop the onions.  In a large skillet, melt 1/2 tsp low fat margarine  in  1/2 tsp olive oil. Add the onions, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar and cook over  moderate heat, stirring frequently, until the onions are well browned, 18 -  25 minutes.  Transfer the onions to a bowl.    Meanwhile, stem 2  Portobello mushrooms.  Halve the caps and slice them  crosswise 1/4" thick.  In the same skillet, melt 1 tsp low fat margarine in  1/2 tsp olive oil.  Add the mushrooms and 1/2 tsp salt and cook over  moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, about 5  minutes.  Add another 1/2 tsp lowfat margarine (if needed) and 1/2 tsp  olive oil (if needed) the thinly sliced fennel and cook for an additional 3  ~ 4 minutes. Add the reserved onions, chopped fresh parsley and fennel.  Season with salt and pepper.    In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until al dente,  about 13 minutes; reserve 1 C of the pasta water and drain the ziti.    In a large bowl, toss the ziti with 1/4 - 1/2 C of the pasta water, the  mushroom mixture, feta, Parmesan cheese.  If the pasta seems dry, add more  of the pasta water.  Serve immediately, passing additional grated Parmesan  (optional) at the table.    I adjusted the original recipe a lot!!  I think my version is incredibly  good.
