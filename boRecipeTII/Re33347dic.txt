Basic Tamales
Masa harina mix, Dried corn husks, Warm pork or poultry broth, Salt, Lard, 
This is a simplified recipe for tamales but they still should have a fairly  authentic taste.    To soak corn husks, cover with warm water; weigh down.  Let soak at least 3  hours or overnight.    For tamale dough: Beat lard and salt until fluffy.  Slowly beat in masa  harina mix alternately with broth until very light and fluffy.    To assemble tamales: Drain corn husks, pat dry.  Spread 2 tablespoons dough  on center of husks forming a 3 x 2-inch rectangle and spreading copletely  to right edge.    Spoon 1 tablespoon filling lengthwise down center of rectangle.  For  fillings, see recipes "Turkey in green mole sauce" or "Pork in red tomato  sauce".    To enclose tamales, turn right side over to center of filling; fold left  side over filling, allowing plain part of husk to wrap around filling. Fold  top end down over bottom end.  Secure ends by tying a string around center  of tamale.    To steam tamales, place a rack 2 inches above gently boiling water in  steamer or 4-quart dutch oven.  Stack tamales, folded side down, on rack.  Cover, steam about 2 hours or until done.  To test for doneness, remove one  tamale from center and one from side of steamer.  Open husks; tamales  should be firm and come away easily from husk. Makes 24.    ARIELLE@TARONGA.COM    (STEPHANIE DA SILVA)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
