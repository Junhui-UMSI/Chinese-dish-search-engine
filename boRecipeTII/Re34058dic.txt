Basmati in the Microwave
Seasoning; (opt), FOR 3 CUPS COOKED RICE, Butter; (opt), Rice, Water, 
A foolproof method for cooking that wonderful rice of India (and now Texas  also).....    Put rice and water and anything else in 2 qt microwave-safe container.  Cover with saran wrap, leaving one corner slightly open. Microwave on hi  for 5 mins. Reduce microwave power to 50 percent and microwave for 15 more  minutes. Let stand 1 minute. Fluff with fork.    Simply delicious    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Jenifer Swanson <jswanson@TIR.COM> on Jan 7,  1998
