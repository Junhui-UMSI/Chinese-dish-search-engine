Carrots Rapee
Grated carrots, Orange juice, Finely minced orange; zested, Lemon juice, Finely minced fresh; mint, 
In a mixing bowl, combine the carrots. Set Aside. In another bowl, combine  the orange juice, orange zest and lemon juice.Add the carrots,mint, toss  and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until ready to toss    This French bistro classic is usually dressed with a vinagrette with quite  a bit of oil. I think its improved when sparked with citrus juice and  mint.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Cozinha@aol.com on Aug 12, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
