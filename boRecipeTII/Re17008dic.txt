Viet-Acadian Salsa
16Oz Cans whole peeled, Sugar, Paprika, Ground hot red pepper,, Ribs celery, Garlic, Jalapeno peppers, Apple cider vinegar, Nuoc mam, Yellow onion, Worcestershire Sauce, Whole cumin seed, 
Heres a salsa recipe Ive been playing around with for about a month or  so. Originally, I wanted to "wrap" a salsa around a core of nuoc cham, with  a hint of a Cajun hot sauce thrown in for good measure. The end result was  a bit of a hybrid, but it seems to have worked out fairly well. Anyway,  enjoy--its a hot one!    Peel (if necessary) and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place in a saucepan.  Add coarsely chopped onion, celery, and jalapenos. Peel and finely dice the  garlic, add half now and reserve the other half.    Grind the cumin seed and add it along with the nuoc mam, vinegar,  worcestershire, paprika, ground red pepper, and three tablespoons of sugar.  Bring to a gentle boil, reduce to a moderate simmer, and cook for 25-30  minutes, or until desired thickness is achieved.    Now, about 5 minutes before the salsa is done, fry the reserved garlic in a  little oil until it is crispy and golden. Remove the salsa from heat, add  the fried garlic with one tablespoon of sugar, and stir occasionally until  the salsa cools (stops steaming).    This should keep for between 1 and 2 weeks at 40 degrees F. The recipe  makes between 1.5 and 2 quarts of salsa.    ~--Tom NOTES  : Mastercook formatted by Garry Howard, Cambridge, MA  garhow@hpubmaa.esr.hp.com or garhow@aol.com    Recipe by: EAT-L - Tom Solomon SOLOMON@ALISON.SBC.EDU
