Batter-Fried Squash Blossoms
Fresh ground pepper, squash blossoms, Cooking oil, Flour, Salt, milk, Paprika, 
In a shaker jar, combine milk, flour, salt and pepper.  Place squash  blossoms in large pie tin and gently pour the milk-flour mixture over them.  Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet until a drop of water will sizzle.  Fry the batter-coated blossoms in the hot oil until golden brown; drain on  paper towels and sprinkle with paprika.  Serve hot.    Squash blossoms are considered the greatest of delicacies by the Zuni.  Choicest of all are the largest male flowers, which are carefully gathered  from the vine, fried in deep fat, and served as an appetizer or used as a  seasoning for vegetables, soups and stews.
