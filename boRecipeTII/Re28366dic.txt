Cover with meat filling and press other half of  kibbee on top. Spread remaining olive oil on top. Bake until deep brown at  375 degrees. Meat filling: Coarse grind 1lb. beef or lamb ( I prefer Lamb  for filling) Brown pine nuts in butter and add onions until translucent.  Brown meat with pinch of cinnamon. Combine with pine nuts and onions Serve  with plain yogurt. Things I forget to tell you: Just before kibbee is ready  to go into oven, score the top layer(about 1/2 inch deep) into 2 inch  squares.
