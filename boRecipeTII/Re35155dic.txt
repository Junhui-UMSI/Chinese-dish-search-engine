Remove the ham hocks from the pan, and add the beans,  add additional water as needed.  Simmer and cook, stirring occasionally,  and adding water if necessary. The beans should be tender in about 1 1/2  hours. Remove the meaty parts of the ham hocks, and discard the bones and  skin. Add the meat to the beans the last 10 or 15 min. of the cooking time.
