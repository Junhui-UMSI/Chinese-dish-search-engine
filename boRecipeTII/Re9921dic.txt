Bring 3 gallons water to boil and put in brew bucket to cool. Bring  1.5  gallons  water  and  crystal malt to boil. Remove  grain.  Add  extract,  honey, burton salts, and irish moss and boil for 15 minutes. Add red hot  candies.  Turn heat to low after candies melt. Add apples  and  cinnamon  and  steep 15 minutes. Dump into brew bucket, then transfer to  primary. (I  made malted applesauce out of the apples by the way!) This ale is a nice  light beer with little bitterness. You cant  really taste the red hots too  much, but the are definitely in the  aroma.  My husband had his doubts  about this since the only hops were whatever  was in the extract, but he  was pleasantly surprised. The red  hot  candies make a very nice addition  to the brew. I think they might be  good  in some other styles, too.
