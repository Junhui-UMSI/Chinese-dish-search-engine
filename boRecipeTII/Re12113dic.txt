Zucchine a Fiammifero (Matchstick Zucchini Sa
Sage leaves, minced, Rosemary, minced, olive oil, Zucchini, lightly steamed, Garlic, Black pepper, Lemon juice, Salt, olive oil, 
Let the steamed zucchini cool.  Warm 1 tb olive oil in a small saute pan  over very low heat & add the garlic. Let it sweat so that the flavour  infuses the oil.  Add the rosemary & sage & let them wilt in the oil for a  minute or so. Cut the cooled zucchini into strips the size of kitchen  matchsticks & place them in the salad bowl. Whisk together the lemon juice,  1/4 c olive oil, salt, pepper & garlic-herb infused oil. Toss carefully,  being extremely careful not damage the fragile zucchini pieces. Serve at  room temperature.
