Set aside to cool to room temperature.    In a double boiler or large bowl over simmering water, beat together the  egg yolks and the sugar with an electric hand mixer until thickened, about  4 minutes. Remove from the heat and continue to beat until cooled and very  thick and pale, about 5 minutes.    Beat the cream until stiff.  Add the egg yolk mixture to the chocolate and  stir until blended.  Fold in the whipped cream until lightened and smooth.  Spoon the mousse into stemmed glasses and chill until firm before serving.    Recipe by Diana Sturgis in "Great Desserts".
