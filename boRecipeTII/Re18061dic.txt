Veggie Cheez Sauces
Cloves roasted garlic [i, Salt; or salt-free seasoning, Fresh Lemon Juice, Water, Quick-cooking rolled oats, Dry mustard, Tahini [i used 1 T]; up to, Nutritional yeast [i used 6, Onion powder, Arrowroot; (or cornstarch), 
ive been experimenting w/ these and have yet to come up w/ a definitive  recipe for what i like, but it so happens that what i like is a combination  of two recipes (i had half of one recipe left over and added it to the same  amount of a new recipe).    the first recipe is simply the "cheese" sauce from the macdougall maximum  weight loss book. (i wont post it here, but if anyone wants it, post me  privately.) i found this sauce to be rather tart in flavor and lurid in  color. so next i tried a recipe for vegan mozzarrella cheese (cant  remember where i found this; ive modified it slightly):    Place all ingredients in a food processor or blender, and process until  completely smooth. Pour into a small saucepan and cook over medium heat,  stirring constantly, until smooth and thick.    this is very tasty, but the tahini adds fat and too much of a "hummus"  flavor. but when i mixed in half of the macdougall recipe, both recipes  were transformed! the macdougalls flavor is much improved, and the color  and fat content of the vegan mozzie recipe are both far more acceptable.  next time i make it, ill figure out how to combine both recipes into one  procedure. in the meantime, if youre looking for a thick, gooey, cheesy  topping, try the vegan mozzie recipe (you could probably reduce the tahini  to the vanishing point, but even in trace amounts, it provides an essential  "cheesy" flavor) or experiment w/ these two recipes on your own!
