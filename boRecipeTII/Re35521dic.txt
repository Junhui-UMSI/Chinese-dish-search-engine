Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote
Chopped rhubarb, water, strawberries, sugar, 
In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine rhubarb, sugar and water. Bring to  simmer, then turn heat very low. Cook without stirring for several hours.  When the rhubarb is very soft, add the strawberries and cook for another  hour or so. Stir gently. Add more sugar if needed.    The ratio of rhubarb to berries is flexible.  Im sure you can prepare this  recipe faster, but Im told rhubarb likes to stew slowly (macerate?). I  start a batch on Saturday, when Im generally in and out of the kitchen  anyway. I like the compote warm or cold. If youre feeling decadent, its  good over ff ice cream or baked goods.    From: MartiRem@aol.com.
