Apricot Turkey Roast
Unsweetened apricot, Reconstituted dried onion, Skinless boneless turkey, Day-old challah or white, 
Heres a fat-free Thanksgiving recipe from my cookbook "Secrets of Fat-Free  Kosher Cooking" by Deborah Bernstein, M.D.    Follow the simple steps below for a turkey roast that is amazingly moist  and tender. Watch turkey carefully while it cooks and take it out just when  its done. Overcooked turkey is dry and correctly cooked turkey has a  texture similar to chicken.    1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Lightly coat a medium baking dish with olive  oil cooking spray.    2. Place the turkey in the baking dish and cover it with the apricot  preserves.    3. Soak each slice of bread with onion soup. Completely cover the turkey  with the bread.    4. Bake for 1 hour, or until the juices from the turkey run clear. The  center of the roast should be slightly pink.    5. Mash the bread and serve it with slices of the roasted turkey.
