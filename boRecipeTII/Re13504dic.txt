Mix and bake as above.  However, I recommend dividing the batch into  two rounds rather than one, so that the scones are smaller. They are not  structurally strong, and the smaller scones are easier to handle. Further  variations: 1. Whether making the original or my variation, I sprinkle the  rounds      before cutting and baking with sugar and cinnamon. 2. At end-of-year  holiday time I substitute the mixed candied fruits      seasonally available for the raisins or currants. 3. For a maple  flavor, substitute REAL maple syrup for the milk,      eliminate the sugar, and add dried milk. 4. Chop 1/2 cup walnuts and  add to either the original or the whole      wheat batch.
