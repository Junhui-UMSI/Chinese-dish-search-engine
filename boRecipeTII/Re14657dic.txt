"Shepherdless" Pie
Potatoes, Carrots; grated, Vegetable stock, Pot barley (or pearl barley), milk, (14oz) tomatoes, chopped, Cheddar cheese; grated, Split red lentils, Onion, 
Put the lentils, barley, carrots, onion, tomatoes and their juice and    stock into a saucepan.    Bring them to the boil, cover the pan, and simmer for 40 minutes or until  the lentils and barley are soft.    Boil the potatoes in their skins.    Peel them as soon as they are cool enough to handle and mash them with the  milk and the cheese.    Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6 or 200~C/400~F.    Put the lentil mixture into a 900ml (1 1/2 pint) pie dish.    Pile the potatoes on top in an even layer.    Make patterns on them with a fork.    Put the pie into the oven for 20 minutes or until the ridges on top begin  to brown.    (Note:  you can use low-fat Cheddar for this instead of full-fat variety)  Posted to MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #151    Date: Fri, 31 May 1996 19:09:43 +0100    From: "Chris&James" <pringles@intonet.co.uk>
