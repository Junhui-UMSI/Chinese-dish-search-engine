CONVERSIONS: 1 lb = 16 oz = 450 g    ABBREVIATIONS: ts = teaspoon                 tb = tablespoon                 sm = small    Mix all ingredients (except oil spray) together well. Divide into portions  (as many as specified in "yield") and shape each into a thick flat round.    Heat a large frying pan (skillet). Spray with a little oil or grease  lightly. Cook 3-4 potato cakes at a time, depending on how large the pan  is.    Do for about 5 minutes on each side until golden - DO NOT disturb them  until the 5 minutes is up or you will spoil the crust. When they have been  cooking 5 minutes try and lift them gently with a spatula. Lift rather than  scrape, and flip over, remembering that they will still be very soft in the  middle. If you like, use another spatula placed over the top of the chop to  keep it together whilst turning over.    Keep them warm in the oven at a moderate heat (375 F, 190 C, Gas 5) while  you cook the others.  Recipe from Quick and Easy Indian Cooking by some man whose namei I cant  remember with a 70s hairstyle. He is the same one who makes khoya out of  powdered milk.
