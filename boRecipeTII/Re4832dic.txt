Loosely tie celery leaves and pickling spices in a piece of cheesecloth,  making a spice bag (see insert below). Place in boiling water and simmer  for 10-15 minutes. Add shrimp and cook 5 minutes. Drain well. Discard  contents of spice bag.    In large bowl, place sliced onions and shrimp in alternating layers.  Add  bay leaves. Combine oil, vinegar, pimentos, capers, celery seed, salt and  hot sauce. Pour over the shrimp and onions. Cover and chill for at least 6  hours or overnight.    With a slotted spoon, remove shrimp and onions. Place them in a serving  bowl, with toothpicks available for spearing shrimp.
