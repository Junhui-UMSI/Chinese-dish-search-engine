Funny you should ask about juicing. I just got my juicer out last week and  decided to use it. I went to the library and checked out a book named  "Juicing for Life" by Cherie Calbom and Maureen Keane. It is a guide to the  health benefits of fresh fruits and vegetable juicing. It has alot of  recipes for juice combinations. I have been using it for about a week. I  think Im going to like it. Here are a couple of recipes to get you started  but you should go check it out.
