Sweet Potatoes with Ham
Butter -- in bits, Brown Sugar, Sweet potatoes -- boiled, Fresh orange juice, Cinnamon, Butter, Cooked ham, Ground cloves, 
Boil sweet potatoes until they can just be pierced with a fork; cool  slightly. When cool enough to handle, peel and slice lengthwise into 1/2"  slices. Slice ham into 1/2" slices about as large as sweet potato slices.  Melt butter and pour into shallow 2 quart baking dish. Stir in 1/4 cup  brown sugar. Place sweet potatoes and ham slices in dish in alternating  rows, turning sweet potatoes to coat with butter. Sprinkle top with  remaining brown sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. Pour juice over all. Place  bits of butter on top. Bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes or until top is  brown, basting with juice if necessary.
