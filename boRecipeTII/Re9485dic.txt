Pumpkin Bread Soup (Panade of Pumpkin)
Onion, (16 oz) pupmkin -or-, Pared and cubed fresh, White bread, Garlic, Green hot pepper or 6 dried, Beef broth, Peanut oil, Spinach leaves, 
As I hiss and gasp through some reheated squash soup with a fresh garden  pepper and a chipotle, I read the pumpkin soup thread.  Heres something  I  found in a caribbean cookbook (Adventures in Cooking series, Culinary Arts  Institure, Delair Publishing).  The book says panades, or bread soups, are  eaten by the country people in the morning.  As always, let every  chile-head use this as a platform for FUN.    Makes about 1-1/2 quarts.    1.  Put garlic and hot pepper into a mortar and pestle and pound to a  paste. Set aside.    2.  Pour beef broth over bread, set aside.    3.  Heat peanut oil in large saucepan; saute onion.  Add bread with beef  broth, pumpkin, and seasoning paste; mix well. Simmer 10 minutes.    4.  Add spinach; bring to boiling, reduce heat, and cook 5 minutes.    *If fresh pumpkin is used, process the soup in an electric blender before  adding the spinach.
