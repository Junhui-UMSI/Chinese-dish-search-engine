*    Pearl Onions are the small white or silver skinned onions that are       usually used in stews.  ~------------------------------------------------------ ~-----------------  Wash the cauliflowers and break them into flowerettes. Scald, cool, and  peel the onions. Mix the vegetables with the salt, add just enough water to  cover, and let stand about 18 hours. Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain  again.  Dissolve the sugar in the vinegar, add the seeds and hot pepper and  bring to a boil.  Add the vegetables and simmer for 10 minutes, or until  the vegetables are barely tender. Pack the vegetables into hot jars, fill  the jars with the boiling-hot liquid and seal. Makes 4 pints.
