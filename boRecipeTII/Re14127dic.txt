Make the truffles: 1. Place the cream and coffee beans in a microwave-safe  small bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute. Let stand for 30 minutes;  remove the coffee beans and discard.    2. Combine the chopped white chocolate, cooled cream and butter in a  microwave-safe small bowl. Heat on high for 1 minutes. Remove from the  microwave and stir. If the chocolate is still fairly solid, heat for  another 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there still seem to  be several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for about       20    seconds, and then stir.    3. Add the coffee liqueur and stir until smooth.    **********************************************************************       TO COMPLETE, CONTINUE WITH "TRUFFLE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS, PART 2"    **********************************************************************    Source: Corby Kummers "Joy of Coffee"  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #170    Date: Sat, 27 Jul 1996 15:29:53 +0000    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>
