Heat oil in a large skillet & saute onions for 3 minutes. Add carrots,  garlic & mushrooms & continue to saute for 10 minutes, stirring  occasionally to prevent burning. Add cooked lentils, tomatoes, tomato  paste, herbs & soy sauce. Add a little of the reserved stock if mixture is  too dry. Cover & cook for 20 minutes to ensure that the flavours are well  blended.    Meanwhile cook enough lasagna strips to make 3 layers. Cook only till al  dente.    BECHAMEL SAUCE: Combine the water, cashews, salt, pepper & nutmeg in the  blender & blend till smooth. Make the roux by heating the oil in a pot &  stirring in the flour when hot. Slowly add the cashew milk, add the bay  leaf & bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly. When boiling, reduce  heat to very low & simmer for about 1 minute or until the sauce starts to  thicken. Set aside. Remove bay leaf before using.    Oil a casserole dish. Put a layer of lasagna in the bottom & layer with the  lentil mixture followed by the bechamel sauce. Repeat, ending with a layer  of bechamel. Top with shredded soy cheese if desired. Bake at 350F for 35  minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
