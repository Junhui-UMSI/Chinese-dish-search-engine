For almonds:  Melt butter in heavy small skillet over medium heat.  Add  almonds and amaretto and stir until almonds are golden brown, about 5  minutes.  Cool on paper towels.    For dough:  Preheat oven to 350-degrees.  Lightly grease 2 large baking  sheets.  Sift 1 cup flour with salt into small bowl.  Using electric  mixer, cream butter with 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl until light and  fluffy.  Blend in egg and amaretto.  Add flour and mix until dough binds.  (Dough will be sticky.)    Divide dough into 30 pieces.  Roll each between palms into balls, dusting  hands with flour if necessary.  Set on baking sheets, spacing 2 inches  apart.    Fill small bowl with water.  Mound sugar on plate.  Dip bottom of 2-1/2"  round glass into water and then into sugar.  Press glass down onto 1 dough  ball, flattening into 2-1/2- to 3-inch round.  Repeat with remaining  dough.  Sprinkle rounds lightly with sugar.    Gently press several glazed almond slivers into each round in flower  pattern.  Bake until edges of cookies are golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool on rack.  Just before serving, dust cookies with powdered sugar if  desired.    Source: Bon Appetit magazine, date unknown.
