Combine the above and bring to a boil, then reduce heat.    1. Deep fry in oil heated to 400-425. This guarantees golden, non-oily  wings.    2. Cook for 10 minutes. The wings will float after the first 5 minutes.    3. Allow cooked wings to sit for a couple of minutes and crisp up.    4. Dip in sauce and serve.
