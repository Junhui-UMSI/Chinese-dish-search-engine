Got this recipe from Cooking Light and it is great!!!    1. Preheat oven to 350.    2. Beat first 3 ingredients at medium speed of a mixer until well-blended  (about 5 minutes). Add eggs and egg white 1 at a time, beating well after  each addition. Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a  knife. Combine 2 tablespoons flour and blueberries in a small bowl, and  toss well. Combine remaining flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Add flour mixture to sugar mixture alternately with yogurt, beginning and  ending with flour mixture. Fold in blueberry mixture and vanilla; pour cake  batter into a 10-inch tube pan coated with cooking spray. Bake at 350 for 1  hour and 10 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out  clean.    3. Cool cake in pan 10 minutes. Remove from pan. Combine powdered sugar and  lemon juice in a small bowl; drizzle over warm cake. Cut with a serrated  knife. Yield: 16 servings (serving size: 1 slice).
