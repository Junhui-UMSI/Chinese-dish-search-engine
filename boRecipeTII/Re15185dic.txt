Whipped Berry Pudding (Vatkattu Marjapuuro)
Uncooked cream-of-wheat, Sugar, Cranberry juice, bottled or, 
(A Finnish dessert)    In a 1 1/2 to 2 quart saucepan, bring the cranberry juice to a boil over  moderate heat. While the juice boils, sprinkle in the sugar, a little at a  time, and then slowly add the Cream-of-Wheat, stirring briskly with a  wooden spoon. Reduce the heat and simmer for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring  occasionally, until the mixture becomes a thick puree. With a rubber  spatula, transfer the puree from the saucepan to a large mixing bowl. Use  an electric mixer for the next step. (Although it is possible to make  vatkattu marjapuuro with a wire wisk, it is scarcely practical; an hour of  vigorous whisking might be required.) Beat with the mixer set a high speed  for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pudding has tripled in volume, is a  delicate pink color and is very light and fluffy. Pour into a large bowl,  or individual dessert bowl, and keep no longer than a few hours before  serving at room temprature. Note: If you wish to make this dessert with a  nontart juice such as apple, strawberry or raspberry, add a tablesppon of  lemon juice.
