1. Cut each tenderloin into 4 cylindrical pieces, about 3 inches long.  Place one piece of the meat between two pieces of wax paper, cut side down.  Pound meat firmly with meat mallet or saute pan, until meat is a uniform  1/2-inch thickness. (If tail end piece is very tapered, set it small end  down on plastic wrap, slice vertically halfway down piece, then cover with  plastic and flatten.) Repeat with remaining pork pieces. 2. Combine flour,  salt and pepper in shallow bowl; mix well. Coat pork pieces with flour  mixture, shaking to remove excess. 3. Heat oil over medium high heat in  large saute pan until hot but not smoking. Add pork scaloppines, and saute  until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove; set aside. 4. Add shallots  and garlic to saute pan; stir constantly, 15 seconds. Add tomatoes. Cook,  stirring constantly, 30 seconds. Add wine; cook, stirring, 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in thyme, basil or oregano and butter if using, and  adjust seasoning. 5. Place pork scaloppines on serving platter. Top meat  with some of the sauce, passing any remaining sauce.
