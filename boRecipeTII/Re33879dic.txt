Been thinking about the problem getting the tofu to come out crispy.    The only thing I can think of is that maybe the oil isnt hot enough.    You are deepfrying the cubes, arent you?  Another trick you might  try is to double fry them.  Do em all once, let em cool a bit then  refry them. Anyway++heres a couple of recipes for you to practice  on.  Theyre from the Ozzie cookbooks Mark brought over.  BTW,  "shallots" refers to scallions rather than what we call shallots.    1:  Cut tofu into 1 1/2 cm cubes.    2:  Heat oil in wok, add garlic, cook for 30 seconds, remove and  discard garlic.  Add tofu to wok in batches, stir-fry gently until  lightly browned; remove from wok.    3:  Add beans, onion and carrot, stir-fry until vegetables are almost  tender.  Add broccoli, celery and shallots, sauces, paste, sugar,  vinegar and spice, stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Stir in tofu with blended  cornflour and water; stir-fry gently until sauce boils and thickens  slightly.    Makes 6 servings.    Best made just before serving.  Freeze: Not suitable.  Microwave: Not  suitable.    From "Easy Thai-style Cookery", Edited by Maryanne Blacker, The  Australian Womens Weekly Home Library, 1991.
