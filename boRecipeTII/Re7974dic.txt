** See recipe for Chicken Stock.         Cut off and reserve the top of the pumpkin.  Use a large spoon or  melon baller to scoop out and discard all of the seeds and strings.  Scrape out the pumpkin flesh without breaking through the shell.  You  should have about 6 cups of pumpkin pieces.  Set aside the hollow  pumpkin and lid.         In a large casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over medium  heat.  Add the onion and saute, stirring often, until softened and  very lightly golden, about 6 minutes.  Add the wine and simmer for 1  minute longer.  Add the turnips, carrot, reserved pumpkin flesh, and  enough Chicken Stock to cover solids.  Season lightly with salt and  pepper.  Cover and bring to a boil.         Meanwhile, cut the bread slices into thin wedges about 1/2-inch  long.  In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of butter over medium  heat.  Add half of the bread pieces and toss constantly in butter  until lightly golden, about 5 minutes.  Add these croutons to the  soup.  Saute the remaining uncooked croutons in the remaining butter,  set aside for garnish.         Boil soup gently, covered, for 1 hour.  Puree mixture in a  processor or blender until smooth.  Return the pureed soup to a clean  saucepan, stir in the cream, and bring to a simmer.  Thin, if  necessary, with additional stock.  Adjust seasoning with salt and  pepper.  Serve soup in pumpkin, passing remaining croutons separately.
