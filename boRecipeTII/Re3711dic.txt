Cook pasta al dente. Drain and  return to the pot. Add bacon pancetta, along with its fat, eggs, both  cheeses, and pepper. Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly. Keep  papsta moving in pot so that the eggs do not scramble. You may have to take  the pot off the heat now and then. A thin sauce should form on the noodles.  Serve immediately. Note: Pancetta is Italian-style bacon. Pecorino Romano  is an Italian hard cheese made from Goats milk. Best substitute is  Parmesan.
