White Pasta From Hell
Chopped scallions; more or, Cream or milk, Progresso white clam sauce, Finely chopped Habaneros, Flour, -(up to), Shitake mushrooms; cut, Butter, 
Ross Thompson mentioned something called "Pasta From Hell".  Heres a  quick and dirty rendition that Ive been making.  Its good hot (sic)  or cold.    To 1 can of Progresso White Clam sauce (the stuff in the jar is a bit  better), add about half a dozen shitake (cut), several chopped  scallions, and 2-4 finely chopped Habs (dried work fine). Let the  sauce simmer about 20 minutes, then thicken with a little butter &  flour and add enough cream or milk to make sauce look white.    You can, of course, add more/less habanero as you see fit.  I made a  cold pasta like this (2 cans sauce, 1/2 of a hab) for a party, and it  went over very well.
