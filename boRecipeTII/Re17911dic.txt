Alt Wien Sweetened Egg Bread
Eggs, Flour; sifted, Anise flavor, Powdered sugar, Sugar; (4.5 to 5); sifted, Vanilla extract, 
Beat eggs over warm water until thick and lemon colored, about 10 to 15  minutes.  Add sugar gradually, beating constantly, until all the sugar has  been used up.  Mix in the flour, one cup at a time, until the mixture is  well blended.  Add vanilla and anise flavor.  Turn into well greased and  lightly floured long narrow baking tins.  Bake in a preheated 375F oven  until delicately browned.  Watch carefully, so that the sweet bread does  not burn.  If the oven is too hot reduce to 350F. Cool. Sprinkle with  powdered sugar.  Slice 1/2 inch thick, spread on a baking sheet, return to  250F oven and let toast gently for 10 min. or until a very light golden  color.    >From: Katie E Green <kgreen@u.washington.edu>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : The Complete Bread Cookbook  NOTES : This is very OLD European recipe was a gift to us from a famous       chef.       The bread is lightly flavored, crisp and sweet.  Uniquely       delicate, it       is an excellent "dunker," served with steaming hot coffee or spice       tea.       The ladies often dipped the sliced Vienna bread i cognac or sweet       wine       - --the very nicest way imaginable of having your cake and eating       it too!
