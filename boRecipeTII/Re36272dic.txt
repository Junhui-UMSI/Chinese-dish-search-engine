Beef Wellington
Water, Egg, Frozen puff pastry, Shallots, Chopped parsley, mushrooms, olive oil, Garlic, Port wine syrup, Red wine, Beef tenderloin, onions, Assorted exotic mushrooms, Foie Gras, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Season the tenderloin with salt and  pepper. In a large saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil  is hot, sear the tenderloin for 2 to 3 minutes on all sides. Remove from  the pan and cool. In a saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the  onions and saute for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the  shallots and saute for 1 minute. In a mini food processor, add the  mushrooms in batches and pulse the mushrooms a few times to finely chop the  mushrooms. Add the mushrooms to the onions and saute for 2 minutes. Add the  red wine and bring the liquid up to a simmer. Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes  or until most of the liquid has dissipated and the mixture is dry. Remove  from the heat and stir in the parsley. Re-season the duxelle if necessary.  Cool the duxelle completely. Season the Foie Gras slices with salt and  pepper. In a hot saute pan, sear the Foie Gras for 30 seconds on each side.  Remove the Foie Gras from the pan and drain on a paper-lined plate. Place  Foie Gras on a clean plate and add the port wine syrup. Set aside. To  assemble; place the two sheets of puff pastry together, vertically, sealing  the ends and forming one big piece of pastry. Lay the seared tenderloin in  the center of the puff pastry. Smear the duxelle over the top of the  tenderloin. Lay the seared Foie Gras directly on top of the duxelle. Wrap  the tenderloin in the puff pastry, tucking the sides in completely. Brush  the entire tenderloin with the egg wash and place on a baking sheet. Bake  the tenderloin for about 30 to 35 minutes for medium-rare, or until the  pastry is golden-brown. Remove the tenderloin from the oven and allow to  rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve the Wellington with a drizzle of  the port wine sauce and sprinkle with sauteed mushrooms. This recipe yields        8    servings.
