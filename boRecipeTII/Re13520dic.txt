In the top of a double boiler or in a small heavy saucepan over very low  heat, melt the chocolate chips and the butter or margarine. Remove the pan  from the heat, and stir the mixture until it is smooth. Set it aside.    In a medium bowl, combine the oats, wheat germ, dry milk, baking powder,  salt, and nuts.  Set the mixture aside.    In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, and mix in the brown and white  sugars and the vanilla until the mixture is thick. Stir in the  melted-chocolate mixture. Fold in the oats mixture until it is just  blended.  Pour the batter in a greased 8-inch square baking pan.    Bake the brownies in a preheated 350 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes or  until the top is crisp but a toothpick inserted in the center of the pan  comes out slightly moist. Set the pan on a rack to cool completely before  cutting the cake into 5 strips in each direction.    Shared and MM by Judi M. Phelps. jphelps@shell.portal.com or  jphelps@best.com
