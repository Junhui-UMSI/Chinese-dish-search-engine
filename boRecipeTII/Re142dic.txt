Sprinkle or crumble yeast into a small dish.   Add water, very warm for dry yeast and lukewarm for compressed yeast. After a minute or two, stir to dissolve.   Cream butter in a large bowl. Add egg yolks, sugar, salt and lemon rind, beating after each addition.  Stir in yeast; mix again.   Add 2 cups of flour. Then alternately add remaining flour and cream; mix well to make a soft dough.   Form into a ball and put in a greased bowl. Turn over.    Put in a warm place, covered with a towel, to rise until doubled in bulk.    Turn out on a floured board; roll to a thickness of 1/4 inch.   Cut into 2-inch rounds. Arrange on ungreased cookie sheets; let rise, covered, in a warm place until doubled in bulk.   Make depression in the center of each round; put in an adequate amount of jam.   Bake in a preheated moderate oven (375F.) about 12 mins, or until cooked.   Sprinkle with confectioners sugar. Makes about 4 dozen.  NOTES : This very well known yeast-raised bun may be filled with apples, apricots, plums, peaches, nuts, a cottage cheese mixture, poppy seeds or jam. Native to Bohemia, kolacky are beloved throughout Czechoslovakia.
