White vinegar, Eggplant, Garlic cloves (to taste) (up, Sugar, Water, Salt to taste, 
This is a recipe that my grandfather taught my father  who then taught it  to me. It is a fairly simple side dish made with eggplant and garlic which  is Roumanian of origin and is delicious served as a relish along side meat  or poultry;.    Poke holes all over  the egg plant with a fork.  Place on a piece of  aluminum foil on broiler rack about 4 inches from flame.  Roast until soft,  turning frequently so eggplant roasts all over  about 20 to 30 minutes.  Remove from broiler and allow to cool enough to handle.  Peel off skin.    This is very important.  Chop  until very  fine in a wooden bowl with  a  chopping tool or on a board with a knife.  This does not work in a food  processor.  Add garlic cloves and continue chopping until garlic is finely  minced and well mixed with the eggplant.    This part works best in a glass jar, but if you dont mind the garlic  smell, any covered container will do. Put the eggplant mixture into a jar  and add the water, vinegar, sugar and salt . Mix well. Refrigerate over  night. ( If you want to limit the salt add only about 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon,  and a couple of dashes of Mrs. Dash original.
