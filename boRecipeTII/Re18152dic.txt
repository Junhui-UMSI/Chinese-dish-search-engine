Velvet Pudding
Cornstarch, milk, Salt, Vanilla extract, Sugar; divided, Eggs, 
Separate eggs; beat yolks wel and mix with milk. Combine 3/4 cup sugar,  cornstarch, and salt. Add milk and egg yolks to sugar mixture. Cook in  double boiler until thick, stirring often. Remove from heat; add vanilla.  Beat egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar until stiff. Put budding in a baking dish  and spread egg whites over the top of the pudding. Brown the meringue in a  350? oven until desired brown. Serves 10.    The pudding is also delicious if the egg whites are folded into the pudding  while it is hot.    *Miss Wilson is a member of the well-known Greenbrier County family and  resides at "Valley View Farm."
