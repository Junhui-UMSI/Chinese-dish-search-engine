Makes enough for 4 pounds.  Place beef into marinade, secure  lid and let stand about 10 minutes, shaking bowl and turning it every few  minutes to cover all pieces equally.  Drain in sieve or colander, place on  trays and dry in dehydrator.  Set vents on top and bottom to fully open.  Normal drying time is 36 to 48 hours on a 5 tray machine.  Dont forget to  rotate.
