Weixenkeimbrot (Molasses Brown Bread)
Whole-wheat flour, Salt, Raisins; Mixed Dark & Light, Wheat germ, Brown sugar, Molasses, Buttermilk, Baking soda, 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Grease a 9 X 5 X 3-inch pan. Combine flour,  wheat germ, brown sugar, salt and raisins in a mixing bowl. Mix well. In a  second mixing bowl, mix baking soda, buttermilk and molasses, using a  wooden spoon.  This misture will start to bubble. Immediately mix it into  the dry ingredients.  Spoon the batter into the greased pan. Bake at once.  The bread is done when a toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour. Turn out  of the pan and cool on a wire rack.    Makes 1 loaf.
