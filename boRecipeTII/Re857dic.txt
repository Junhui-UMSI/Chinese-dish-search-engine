Honey Cake
Vegetable oil, Eggs, Honey, Sugar, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Flour, 
I make this every year. Got it from my mother who got it from her mother.  Its very good, but burns very easily. It has to be baked at a lower  temperature and can sometimes take 1.5 to 2 hours to be done.    Mix ingredients together, beating until mixture is smooth and fluffy. Bake  at 300 degrees for 1 hour. Lower temperature to 275 degrees and monitor at       15    minute intervals.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Hanna Berger <hannab@jagunet.com> on Sep 9,  1998,
