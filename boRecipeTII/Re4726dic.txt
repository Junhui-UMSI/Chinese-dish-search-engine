Use Rice sticks or cellophane noodles. Partially freeze beef before  cutting. Cooks notes: Star anise, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and Asian chili  sauce are available at Asian markets or some supermarkets with large Asian  specialty sections. Use caution when working with fresh chilies. Upon  completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands thoroughly; do not touch  your eyes. Procedure: Combine the beef stock, ginger, star anise, green  onions and fish sauce and gently simmer for 30 minutes.   Remove the ginger, anise and green onions. Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes.  Slice the green onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible. Slice  the beef as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to partially  freeze the meat before slicing.   Bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Arrange the bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter.   Just before  serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in boiling water  for 30 seconds, then drain. Presentation: Divide the noodles among 4 large  bowls. Arrange the scallions, onion slices and beef slices on top. Spoon  the boiling broth on top: The heat of the liquid should be sufficient to  cook the meat. Serve the soup at once, with the garnish platter on the  side. Let each person add sprouts, mint, chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce to taste. Yield: Makes 4 servings.
