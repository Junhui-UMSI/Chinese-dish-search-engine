Cut into spread (6 inch for quart, 4 inch for pints). Combine  vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Heat to boil. Pack asparagus in jars with  tips down. Put 1 clove garlic in each jar. Cover with boiling bring to  within 1/2 inch from top of jar. Adjust lids. Process in hot water bath for       10    minutes    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #63    From the MasterCook recipe list.
