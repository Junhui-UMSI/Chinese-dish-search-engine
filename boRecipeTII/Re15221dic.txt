Whipped Honey-Nut Spread
Hazelnuts Or Almonds,, Shelled -- can use 1 1/2, Roasted pistachios, Cups, Whipped Honey, 
Place hazelnuts or almonds in a single layer in a 9- to 10-inch wide pan,  and bake in a 350 degree oven until golden throughout (cut one in half to  check color), 10 to 12 minutes.  Let nuts cool. (If using pistachios, omit  this step.) Shell pistachios, if used. To skin hazelnuts or pistachios  (almonds do not need to be skinned), place nuts in a clean towel and rub  gently to remove loose peel; the nuts do not need to be completely skinned.  Place nuts in a food processor or blender. Whirl, pulsing on and off, just  until finely chopped; do not whirl into a paste. In a bowl, combine honey  and nuts; mix to blend.  Serve, or pack into small containers, cover and  store in a cool place up to 1 month. Makes 1 1/2 cups.
