Stuff into cod immediately before baking.    Remove bone from whole cod (head, tail and fins removed). Stuff interior of  cod with savoury stuffing (see below). Bind cod with twine to hold in  stuffing, and top generously with salt pork fat back. Bake cod with open  side/salt pork up at 350 Degrees F for one hour or until salt pork is brown  and crunchy. Thats about it, you could sub in bacon for the salt pork, but  it is good with the salt pork. Enjoy.
