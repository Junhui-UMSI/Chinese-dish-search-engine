Vanilla-Bean Custard
Sugar, Heavy cream 1 1/4 C milk, Egg yolks, Whole vanilla bean; split, 
1. Heat oven to 300 F. Place an oven rack one-third of the way up from the  bottom. Choose a small roasting pan large enough to hold four 6- ounce  custard cups, and fill it with enough water to go half way up the sides of  cups. Place pan without cups in the oven. Meanwhile, combine cream, milk,  and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan; bring to boil.    2. Whisk together the yolks and sugar in a medium bowl until light and  fluffy. Slowly whisk in the hot milk until completely combined, then pour  into custard cups, and place them in the pan of hot water. Bake on the  lower shelf until the custard has set and is no longer liquid when lightly  touched in the center, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove pan from the oven, remove  custard cups from the water, and place on a wire rack to cool.    3. Serve at room temperature or chilled.
