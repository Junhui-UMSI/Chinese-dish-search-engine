West Indian Pumpkin Soup
Onion, Reduced-fat sour cream, Salt & freshly ground black, Carrot, fresh parsley, Calabaza, chives, Defatted reduced-sodium, olive oil, red pepper (Cayenne), Scotch Bonnet chile, fresh thyme, celery, Brown sugar, garlic, Bay Leaves, 
Heat oil in a Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat.  Add onions, celery,  and carrots; cook until soft but not brown, 3-4 minutes.  Add garlic and  chiles and cook for 1 minute more.  Stir in stock, squash, parsley, bay  leaves, thyme, and sugar.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low  and simmer until the vegetables are very soft, 25-30 minutes. Discard the  bay leaves and thyme sprigs.    Puree the soup in a blender or food processor, in batches if necessary,  until very smooth.  Add a little water if the soup is too thick.  (The soup  can be made ahead to this point and kept covered in the refrigerator for up  to 2 days.)    Return the soup to the pot and stir in 1/2 cup sour cream.  Simmer the soup  for 3 minutes.  Adjust seasonings, adding brown sugar, salt, and pepper to  taste.    To serve, ladle the soup into bowls.  Garnish each portion with a 1/2 tb.  dollop of sour cream, some chives or scallions, and a dusting of red  pepper. Serve at once. Makes about 7 cups. Serves 6.
