Mix all ingredients for meat balls together thoroughly, except the last,  olive oil.  Form into medium sized balls: brown in oil.  Set aside and cook  in tomato sauce later.     To make tomato sauce: Heat the oil: add onion, green pepper, garlic,  mushrooms (drained and halved) and saute until golden. Stir in tomato  paste; cook for 4 minutes. Press plum tomatoes through a strainer; add an  equal amount of water. Combine with tomato paste mixture. Add sugar, salt  and pepper. Bring to a boil; add meatballs and cook over low heat 1-1/2  hours or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove meatballs and put aside.     Cook tufoli in 6 quarts boiling, salted water for 12 to 15 minutes or  until almost tender. Mash meat balls in a bowl. Add spinach (drained and  finely chopped), salt, 2 tablespoons cheese and the egg, mixing well. Stuff  this mixture into cooked tufoli. Cover bottom of a large casserole with  half of sauce and arrange alternate layers of stufted tufoli and sauce,  sprinkling each layer with cheese; finish with sauce. Cover dish and bake  in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 30 minutes. Serve with extra sauce and  cheese. Serves 6 very generously.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.
