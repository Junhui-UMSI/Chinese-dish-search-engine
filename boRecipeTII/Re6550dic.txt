Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 20  minutes. Strain through a double thickness of cheesecloth and discard  vegetables. Pour this court bouillon into a fish poacher or large roasting  pan.  Add the rose. Wash the fish inside and out with cold running water.  Pat it dry with a paper towel. Place the fish on a rack and put it into the  pan.  If the fish is not at least half-covered by the bouillon, add up to  one cup extra water. Bring stock just to a boil, cover and poach over  lowest heat for 45 minutes or just until the fish flakes easily with a  fork.  Carefully lift the rack with the fish on it from the pan. Drain  well.  Place the fish on a platter and garish it with lemon wedges and the  rset of the parsley.  Serve with hollandaise sauce or with a pineapple  salsa.
