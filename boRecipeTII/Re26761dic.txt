Halve & core apples. Place in 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Dissolve sugar in  boiling water & pour over apples. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake at 350 for  45 minutes or until tender. Drain, cool & scrape pulp from skins. Process  until smooth. Measure about 2-3/4 cups pureed apples. (For a short cut, use  applesauce.) Soften gelatin in 1-1/2 cups apple puree. Heat until gelatin  dissolves & remove from heat. Stir in remaining puree, milk, sugar & salt.  In a large mixer bowl, mix 4 eggs. Add cream, pudding mix, lemon juice,  cinnamon & nutmeg. Stir in puree mixture. Freeze in ice cream freezer  according to directions.    KATHERINE HILL    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.
