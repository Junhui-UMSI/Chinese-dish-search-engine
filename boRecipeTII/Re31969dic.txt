Taco Meatballs
Garlic salt, Cheddar cheese soup, Rice, cooked, Onion, Taco sauce, Celery, Green pepper, Egg, Beef, ground, 
Mix all but last two ingredients. (I puree vegetables  in blender rather than chopping.) Form meat balls and  place in 2- 1/2 qt. dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 30  minutes. While baking, heat taco sauce and soup on  stove. Pour over meatballs and bake another 30 minutes.
