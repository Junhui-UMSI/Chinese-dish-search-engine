Pan Rolls (this recipe is great for the BM using the dough setting)    In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Blend in eggs and oil or  margarine.  Add 5 cups bread mix. Blend well. Add additional bread mix to  make a soft, but not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is  smooth.   Lightly butter bowl.  Put dough in bowl and turn to butter top. Cover  dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,  about 1 hour. Grease a 13" x 9" baking pan or two 9" round pans. Punch down  dough again until doubled in bulk, about 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat oven to  375. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown. Makes about 24 rolls.
