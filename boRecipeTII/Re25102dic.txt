Tomato, Lime and Tortilla Soup
Cumin, Garlic, Vegetable oil, Jalapeno chiles, Lime juice, Cilantro, Oregano, Tomatoes, Tortilla chips, Vegetable stock, Onions, Salt, 
In a soup pot, saute onions & garlic in oil until softened.  Add the  chiles, cumin & oregano & saute a few more minutes.  Add tomatoes &  sprinkle with a little salt.  Cover the pot & cook gently until the  tomatoes begin to release their juices.  Stir occasionally.  Add stock &  simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Add lime juice & check the seasoning.    Serve topped with crumbled tortilla chips (I find that these are not  necessary) & garnish with cilantro.
