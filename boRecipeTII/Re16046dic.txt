Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.    In a metal bowl combine the bittersweet and unsweetened chocolates. In a  saucepan bring the butter to a boil and pour it over the chocolates. Whisk  until the mixture is smooth. In another bowl whisk together eggs, sugar,  Baileys, and vanilla. Add chocolate mixture to egg mixture and combine  well. Sift dry ingredients over chocolate mixture and combine until smooth.    Arrange ten 4-inch tart rings, sprayed with vegetable oil spray, or a  baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Divide the mixture among the rings  smoothing the top, and push a piece of chocolate into the center of each  one.
