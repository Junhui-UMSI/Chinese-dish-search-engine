Combine crushed peppercorns, thyme and tarragon. (Spice mixture may be  combined in various amounts according to personal taste.) Press mixture  firmly into meat using the heel of the hand. Let pork chops stand at room  temperature for up to 30 minutes to allow flavours to permeate the meat. In  a non-stick skillet, heat oil and butter together over medium heat. Saute  pork chops for 5 to 7 minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm.    Sauce: Add chopped onions, wine and bouillon to skillet. Bring to a boil,  scraping up brown bits with a wooden spoon. Reduce liquid by half. Pour  sauce over pork chops and serve. 6-8 servings    Recipe by: Manitoba Pork    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #975 by "Bob & Carole Walberg"  <walbergr@mb.sympatico.ca> on Dec 30, 1997
