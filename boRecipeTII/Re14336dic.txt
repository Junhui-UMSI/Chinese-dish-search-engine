MAKES twelve 4-1/2-inch squares. *These tender waffles are practically fat  free. The butter granules (such as butter buds) add richness but negligible  fat. In repeated testings, we found them to be crispers lighter and more  flavorful than the same recipe made with a tablespoon or two of oil. Make  the waffles tart by adding one-half cup dried cherries to the batter and  serve with Orange and Dried Cranberry Sauce; or sweeter with one-third cup  dried blueberries and serve with dried Blueberry Honey Sauce or with a  Strawberry-Peach Sauce.    PREPARATION *Prepare sauce of your choice and set aside. Grind the millet  in a blender until the kernels are at least half their original size. Place  them in a large mixing bowl with the other ingredients except the  buttermilk, egg substitute and vanilla, and stir until completely blended.  Add the buttermilk, egg substitute and vanilla and stir until thoroughly  blended.    *Coat the waffle iron with a light film of vegetable spray. Heat the waffle  iron and cook the waffles according to the manufacturers directions.  Between each batch stir the batter and spray the grids of the iron to  prevent the waffles from sticking. Keep each batch warm and when they are  all cooked, serve immediately with the sauce.    >(c) 1997 Helen Cassidy Page and John Speer Schroeder, The Stanford  University Healthy Heart Cookbook (Chronicle).
