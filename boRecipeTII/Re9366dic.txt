Add ingredients in order given by manufacturer. Select dough/manual cycle.  When cycle is complete, remove dough to lightly floured surface. If needed,  knead more flour into dough to make it easy to handle. Divide dough into 20  equal portions. Form each piece into a small ball. Sift together the sugar  and cinnamon. Dip each ball into melted butter then roll in the cinnamon  sugar. Arrange half the balls in the bottom of a greased 8 cup ring mold or  fluted tube pan with nonremovable bottom. Make a second layer positioning  the balls for the second layer between the balls in the first layer.  Drizzle balls with any remaining butter and sprinkle with any remaining  sugar mixture.
