385 Norths Tataki of Beef (Marinated Beef)
Pepper, Peanut oil, Green onions, ginger root, garlic, Dark soy sauce, Chiso (ooba leaf), Lime juice, Culotte steak, 
Combine ginger, garlic, soy sauce, chiso and lime juice in flat glass dish  just large enough to hold steak (read Ziplock baggie:>) and set aside. Trim  steak to remove excess fat and season to taste with pepper on top and  bottom. Sear beef quickly in hot peanut oil on all sides over high heat.  Cook to rare stage only.    Place in dish with marinade and turn to coat well. Refrigerate, turning  occasionally, at least one hour. Steak should be very cold and firm before  slicing.    To serve, thinly slice diagonally. Sprinkle steak slices with thinly sliced  green onions cut on the bias and spoon small amount of marinade over, or  serve on a bed of julienned carrots, Chinese pea pods, or other thinly  sliced vegetables, if desired. Makes 4 sevings.    Note: Chiso or ooba is available in Oriental markets.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Imildur@aol.com on Sep 8, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
