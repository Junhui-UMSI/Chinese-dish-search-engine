Salt (scant), Fresh yeast, Fine oatmeal, Water at blood heat,

Cream the yeast with a teacupful of  water, and leave it to rise to a creamy froth.  Mix into the oatmeal and  add more water until the batter is like a thick cream. A ladleful is thrown  onto the heated griddle or bakestone, in a narrow strip. It immediately  puffs up with steam, which makes it smooth underneath and rough on top.  "When baked it is damp and flexible, and is hung on the wooden clothes rail  before the fire" (if you have one!) "to dry, or on lines across the kitchen  ceiling.  It must be crisped quickly immediately before it is to be eaten."  The flavour is slightly bitter and very appetising. "It can be used for  soups, fish, fowl, cheese, butter, or any kind of meat in place of any  other kind of bread or biscuit."    (Lacking lines in the kitchen, you might try hanging the cakes over a  broomstick handle in front of a radiator or open fire, or just toasting  them under the broiler. When we had an Aga, in the kitchen of the last  house we rented, we used the "towel-drying rail" in front of the ovens for  this kind of thing, as well as for drying pasta: it worked very well.)
