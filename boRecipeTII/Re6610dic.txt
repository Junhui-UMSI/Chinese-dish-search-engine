Poffertges--Doughnuts From Holland
Flour; sifted, Butter, Milk; scalded, Salt, Sugar, Eggs; unbeaten, 
Add the butter to the milk and stir until it melts in a saucepan. Add  the flour and salt and beat until smooth. Cook, stirring constantly, until  the dough leaves the sides of the pan; remove from the stove and blend in  the sugar and eggs.  Shape into small balls and fry in deep fat until dark  brown.       Note.  This is similar to a cream puff recipe except they are baked.
