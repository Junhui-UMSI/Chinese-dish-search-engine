Uzvar (Dried Fruit Compote)
Honey, clover, Apple Cider, Juice And Zest Of 1 Lemon, Dried Prunes, Dried Pear, Cinnamon, Raisins, Cloves, Dried Apple, 
Combine the fruit in a large pot and fill with enough cider to cover it by  a third more.  (The fruit will absorb a lot of liquid.)  Add the cloves  and lemon peel.  Simmer until the larger pieces are cooked but not falling  apart.  Pour off the liquid into a pan and cook until reduced by 1/3rd.  Add the honey, cinnamon, lemon juice, and fruit.  Reheat, stirring.  Taste, and add more lemon juice if needed.  It should not be cloying  sweet, the taste of the fruit should dominate.  Serve warm in crystal or  clear glass bowls.  Keeps in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/eve.txt
