Picante Grilled Shrimp
Pace Picante Sauce, Garlic, Shrimp, Salt, lime juice, 
Rinse shrimp in cool running water; dry with paper towels. Thread shrimp  onto skewers. For sauce, combine remaining ingredients; mix well. Brush  shrimp with sauce. Place skewered shrimp on grill over hot coals or on rack  of broiler pan; grill or broil 5 to 8 minutes or until shrimp is cooked  through, turning and basting occasionally with sauce. Heat remaining sauce;  serve with shrimp. Makes 4 servings.    Note from Pace: When the over-the-coals entree must be elegant, but time is  at a premium, these impressively skewered shrimp are an easy menu solution.
