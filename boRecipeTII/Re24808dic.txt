Rich, this is an old favorite of mine, from my great-grandmother. Thought  everyone would enjoy it.  I love them, and so does the rest of my family.  They were always part of Christmas baking for us.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine shortening, oats, flour, sugar,  raisins, milk, cinnamon, soda and salt. It should stick together when you  squeeze a small amount in your hand. Drop small amounts on sheet. Bake 10  minutes.    Hope you try them, they are the best Ive ever tasted, though Im probably  biased.    Reposted By Ellen Cleary
