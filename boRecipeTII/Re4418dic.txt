To poach the fish, combine the water, lemon juice, parsley, salt and pepper  in a large deep skillet. Add the fish fillets, in one layer if possible.  Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat and cover the skillet.  Simmer the fish for 5-10 minutes, or until it is just cooked through but  not falling apart. (If the fillets are thick, carefully turn them once  during the poaching). Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fish to a deep  serving dish. Reserve the broth. For the sauce, beat the eggs and lemon  juice together in a medium bowl. In a small bowl, mix the cake meal and  water to make a creamy paste. Stir the paste into the egg-lemon mixture.  Then gradually stir in about 1/2 cup of the hot fish broth. Stirring  constantly, add all the egg-lemon mixture back into the hot fish broth and  stir over low heat until the sauce has thickened. Adjust the seasoning, if  necessary. pour the sauce over the fish. Serve hot or, as is more  customary, refrigerate the fish and the sauce and serve them chilled.
