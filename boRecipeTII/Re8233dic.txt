Potato Latkes for Hanukkah
Salt, Eggs, Matzoh meal, Potatoes, Onions, Vegetable oil, Pepper, white, 
Peel potatoes and place in cold water until ready to prepare latkes.  Starting with onions, alternately grate some onions on large holes of  grater and some potatoes on smallest holes. This will keep potato mixture  from blackening.  (Or use food processor.  The steel blade produces a  smooth textured latke and the grating disk a crunchy one.)    Press out as much liquid as possible and reserve starchy sediment at bottom  of bowl.  Return sediment to mixture, but not liquid. Blend potatoes with  eggs, matzoh meal, salt, and white pepper.    Heat 1" of oil in frying pan.  Drop about 1 tb mixture for each latke into  skillet and fry, turning once. When golden and crisp on each side, drain on  paper towels. Serve with yogurt, sour cream, sugar, or applesauce.    From the recipe files of Sylvia Steiger, GENie THE.STEIGERS, CI$  71511,2253, GT Cookbook echo moderator at net/node 004/005
