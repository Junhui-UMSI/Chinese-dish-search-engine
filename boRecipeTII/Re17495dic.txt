FOR THE PASTRY: Combine pastry ingredients by hand or in a food processor  to form a soft dough. Do not overmix. Chill for 30 minutes. Roll out and  line an 11-or-12-inch pie or tart pan. Prick the base and chill for  15-to-20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F. FOR THE FILLING: Heat 1/3 of the  butter in a saute pan, add the chopped almonds and saute over medium heat  until browned. Cool. Melt the remaining butter in a small saucepan. Cool.  Mix the ground almonds and sugar in a bowl and add the eggs one by one,  beating after each addition until the mixture is light and thick. Sift the  potato or corn starch with the baking powder and salt and fold into the  almond mixture. Fold in the melted butter. Do not overmix. Pour the mixture  into the tart shell and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the batter begins  to set. Quickly scatter the chopped almonds over the top in one even layer.  Return the tart to the oven and continue baking for 17-to-20 minutes or  until the pastry is brown and the filling is firm.
