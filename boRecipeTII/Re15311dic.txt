White Bean Dip with Garlic and Cilantro
cannelini  , fresh cilantro leaves, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Crushed red pepper, Salt, Fresh lime juice, garlic, 
(from Ladies Home Journal, June 1997)    Heat oil over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper. Cook 30 seconds until  fragrant. Remove from heat. Place beans, cilantro, lime juice and salt in  food processor. Add oil mixture and process until mixture is smooth. Serve  or refrigerate up to 24 hours. Let stand for 1 hr at room temp.    I will serve the dip with fresh veggies (carrots, celery, brocolli etc) or  with "sesame crisps" (flour tortillas that have been brushed with beaten  egg white, sprinkled with sesame seeds and baked until lightly browned and  then broken into serving size pieces).
