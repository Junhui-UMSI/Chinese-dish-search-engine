Vegetarian Mock Kishka
Pepper, Flour, Paprika (optional), Salt, Onions,sliced, Vegetable oil, 
It is from the Spice and Spirit cookbook published by Chabad Lubavitch.    In a large bowl combine onion flour and seasonings. Add the oil so that the  "kugel" holds together enough to be shaped and hold firm. Shape into oval  loaf. It can then be placed on top of the cooked cholent before it is  placed on the blech. (Sounds blech to me) My addition--I think this means  add it in the final stages of cooking, probably 30-45 minutes before the  cholent is served. Make sure that this "Kugel" is covered with sufficient  water and that the water is boiling when the "kugel" is placed in it.    The " kugel" can also be placed in aluminum foil and placed on top of the  cholent.    My version--I prepare the "Kugel" . Put all the ingredients for the cholent  in a slow cooker and plpoace the kugel wrapped in foil paper on top. I  simmer the whole thing on slow overnight.    Once this "kugel" has absorbed the flavour of the cholent it looks and  tastes like kiske.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #052 by aizenman@cadvision.com (Cynthia  Aizenman) on Feb 15, 1997.
