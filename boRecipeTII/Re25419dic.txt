*Please note: Cornmeal tortillas CANT be substituted because they do not  take on the texture of pastry when fried.   Combine sugar and cinnamon and reserve.  Heat oil in a skillet and fry  tortilla on both sides until golden brown and puffy. Drain on a paper  towel. Brush tortilla with melted butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  Top with ice cream and garnish with fruit and nuts. Serves 1. Source:  Lawrys Calif. Center
