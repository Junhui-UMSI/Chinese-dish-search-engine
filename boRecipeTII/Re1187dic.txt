Crecent Roll Cheese Squares
Tube of crescent roll, Cream cheese, Broccoli; only the tops, and, Carrots; julianned fine, or, Onion soup mix, Cheddar Cheese, 
*unroll the crecent dough, and spread flat on a baking sheet (about 9x12 is  ok - however the dough fits best - and try not to pull apart the  perforations in the dough! - if using reduced fat, spray the baking sheet  and the top of dough w/ the non stick spray. Also lining the sheet with tin  foil cuts down clean-up time tremendously)    *Bake the crescent roll dough according to instructions. Let cool.    *Blend the cream cheese with the onion soup mix to taste (you may or may  not use the entire pkt.)    *Spread the cream cheese evenly over the baked dough.    *Sprinkle the chopped broccoli, carrots, and cheese evenly over the cream  cheese.    *Cut into bite sixed square..    HINT: I always make at least two tubes worth - it just goes that fast!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Linda Shapiro <lss@coconet.com> on Nov 12,  1998,
