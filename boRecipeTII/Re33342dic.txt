Basic Sweet Dough
Lightly salted butter, Salt, Active dry yeast, All-purpose flour, Granulated sugar, Eggs, Instant nonfat dry milk, water, 
Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Let stand for 2  minutes.    Add the dry milk, eggs, butter, salt, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Mix  until smooth, then beat for 2 minutes. Stir in enough of the remaining  flour to make a soft dough.    Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface (using some of the remaining  flour) and knead for 6 to 8 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding only  as much flour as needed to prevent the dough from sticking.    Place the dough in a greased bowl; turn once to bring the greased side up.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume,  about 1 1/2 hours.    Punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface.

It can be shaped into twists,  rolls, rings, and braids.  Each of the accompanying recipes calls for half  a recipe of the dough.  Double the filling if you wish to make two  coffecakes, or make two different coffeecakes from one batch of dough.  Either way, you can freeze one to use later.
