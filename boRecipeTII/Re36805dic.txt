Add sugar and wine; stir well; chill.    Soften gelatin in cold water. Add boiling water; stir to dissolve; cool.    Combine gelatin and strawberry mixture; beat until fluffy and slightly  thickened. Fold in whipped cream. Pour into non-stick 2 qt mold (or very  lightly oil one.) Chill at least 3 hours. Yield 8 servings.    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #137    From the MasterCook recipe list.
