Baked Blue Flower Chive Omelet
Eggs, Butter, Minced chives, salt and pepper, Dozen or so chive blossoms;, milk, 
(Naturally, this dish can only be made when the chives are at full bloom. )    Melt the butter in a frying pan then combine the remaining ingredients  (save the blossoms) in a blender and pour into the hot, buttered pan. As  the edges of the omelet begin to set, reduce the heat somewhat and with a  spatula turn the uncooked eggs to the bottom of the skillet until they are  all cooked.    Sprinkle the washed blossoms across the top of the eggs and then fold the  omelet over and let cook another few minutes. Serve.    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 27, 1998
