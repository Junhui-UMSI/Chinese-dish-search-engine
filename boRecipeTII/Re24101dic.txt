Mix well and continue to add  remaining flour and water......... be quick about this, dont let it get  cold. Knead well, about 20 times......... until youre happy with it warm  the oven for rising Place in greased bowl and turn greased side up, rise  until double ( I usually put a wet towel over the bowl while rising to  prevent drying. punch down and split in half, roll each half to about  9x18x1, roll up and pinch ends, tuck underneathplace in loaf pans. (cast  iron works best) re-rise until double or so......... move directly into  baking at 350 DEGF, sometimes it takes 25 min, sometimes it takes 40  minutes......... loaves will sound hollow when tapped on top and are golden  brown. brush with butter, while cooling on wire rack.
