Twice-Baked Potato Casserole with Mushrooms and Cream
Heavy cream, Salt, Black Pepper, Butter, Potatoes, scrubbed and, Fresh mushrooms, sliced, 
Here is an elegant potato dish that can be made ahead. You may substitute  wild mushrooms for the cultivated ones called for here if you like. Soak 1  ounce in 1 cup hot water for 30 minutes. Squeeze dry and chop coarse. Toss  for a few minutes in the butter. The mushrooms taste almost like ham in  this dish.    Preheat oven to 400 F. Place the potatoes in the oven and bake until  tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small skillet heat the butter,  add the mushrooms, and saute 5 minutes. Scoop out the cooked pulp of the  potatoes and coarsely break it up in a bowl. Add the mushrooms, salt, and  pepper. Spoon into a 1 1/2-quart buttered gratin dish. When ready to cook,  pour the cream over the top. Reduce the heat to 350 F and bake until  browned, about 30 minutes.    Recipe is from _Nathalie Dupree Cooks for Family and Friends_.
