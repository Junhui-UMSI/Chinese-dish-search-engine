Cut shortening into flour & salt. Beat eggs into flour mixture & make a  stiff dough. Knead well. Let stand, covered, 1/2 hour. Roll out very thin  on floured cloth. Let dry a little (must not be sticky, but not brittle).  Cut into 2-inch squares. Filling: Mix first 6 ingredients well. Place  teaspoon of meat mixture on dough square. Fold each square into triangle,  sealing edges. (If you have any meat left over, shape into tiny meatballs).  Drop ravioli into 2 quarts boiling salted water. Add 1 teaspoon oil to  water & cook about 20 minutes. Take up with skimmer, drain & place in  greased baking dish. Make your favorite creole sauce & pour over ravioli &  coat each one. Add a can of mushrooms & top with Romano cheese.    JANE GALYEON    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
