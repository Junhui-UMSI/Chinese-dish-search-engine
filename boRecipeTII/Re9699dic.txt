Pumpkin Pie 2
Unbaked pie crust (9"),, Regular canned pumpkin, Extra large eggs, plus 1, Teasp nutmeg, Teasp each, salt, cinnamon,, Dark rum (or brandy, if you, Pecans, Sugar, Heavy cream, 
Combine pumpkin, sugar, cream, eggs, rum (or brandy) and spices.  Using  electric mixer at low speed, mix until well blended.  Pour filling into  chilled pie shell and sprinkle with pecans.  Bake in preheated 425 degree  oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for 30-40 minutes  more or until filling is completely set.  (Watch out for pie crust edges  getting too dark.)  Cool pie and serve with whipped cream sweetened with  dark honey (1 tablesp. honey to 1 cup cream).    Note:  This is definitely not for someone who is watching his/her fat  content - but then it is Thanksgiving.  I also use Cool Whip instead of the  sweetened whipped cream sometimes - either way its still delicious.
