Annie Little Johns Chili
Soup bone, Salt to taste, Water as needed, Pinto beans, cooked, Cayenne to taste, Beef roast, Mexene chili powder, Cumin seed, Black pepper to taste, 
Cook meat and soup bone separately until tender in enough water to keep  covered. Dice roast, strain stock, and add the cooked beans.Stir in the  Mexene and cumin seeds. Add salt and pepper (black and red) to taste. Cook  very slowly over low flame 1 to 1 1/2 hours. AUTHORS NOTE: Leftover roast  beef will do a good job too, as will canned pintos.
