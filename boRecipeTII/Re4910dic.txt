Pickled Eggs-Kathleen Pickell
Cloves, Whole black peppers, Celery seed, Salt, Water, Sliced ginger root OR, White vinegar, 
Put the spices into a small cotton bag or a bag made from several  thicknesses of cheese cloth. Put the bag into the vinegar with salt and  water and boil 10 minutes. Remove spice bag and let solution cool.  Hard-cook a dozen eggs, dash into cold water to cool rapidly and remove  shells. Pack eggs into half-gallon, quart or pint seal jars. The eggs may  be kept for several weeks at room temperature but cool storage is  recommended. Let stand in pickling solution at least two days before using.  (NOTE: If preferred, spices may be onitted or a little sugar or garlic  added.) Pickled eggs may be used liced as a garnish, in salads, as a  relish, served whole or cut in half to eat out of hand. Tint if desired by  adding food colour to pickling mixture.
