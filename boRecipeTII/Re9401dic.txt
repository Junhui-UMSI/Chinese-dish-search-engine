Workbasket Recipes: This issue (March, 1979) has a large article entitled  "Bread: From Freezer To Oven". I thought the breads looked interesting, so  I am posting them, but each is fairly long, and will probably have its own  mailing.    Combine flours. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix 2 cups flour mixture, salt,  shredded wheat cereal, corn meal and undissolved yeast.    Combine water, molasses, chocolate and margarine in a saucepan. Heat over  low heat until liquids are very warm. Margarine and chocolate do not need  to melt. Gradually add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at medium  speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add potatoes and 1 cup  flour mixture. Beat at high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl  occasionally. Stir in caraway seeds and enough additional flour mixture to  make a stiff dough. Turn out onto lightly floured board; cover dough and  let rest 15 minutes. Then knead until smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes.    Divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Form each piece into a smooth round ball.  Flatten each ball into a mound, 6 inches in diameter. Place on greased  baking sheets. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until firm. Transfer to  plastic bags. Freeze up to 4 weeks.    Remove from freezer; unwrap and place on ungreased baking sheets. Cover;  let stand at room temperature until fully thawed, about 3 1/2 hours. Let  rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.    Bake at 375 about 35 minutes, or until done. Remove from baking sheets and  cool on wire racks.    TO BAKE WITHOUT FREEZING:    After shaping, let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in  bulk. (Unfrozen dough will rise faster than frozen dough). Makes 3 loaves.
