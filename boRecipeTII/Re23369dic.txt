Place the 1/2 cup cold water in a small bowl, add gelatin and let stand  5 minutes to soften. 2. In a saucepan, heat the broth until very hot, add  the softened gelatin and stir to dissolve. 3. In a large bowl place the 1  cup mayonnaise; add gelatin mixture slowly, stirring constantly. Next,  blend in 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, lemon juice, onion, Worcestershire sauce,  salt and pepper. Chill until mixture is slightly thickened. 4. Lightly oil  a 1 quart mold with salad oil; do not use olive oil. Use a fish mold if you  can for an impressive dish. Invert the mold to drain excess oil. 5. If  using almonds, blanch, sliver then toast, or buy already prepared ones.  Drain and flake a 7-ounce can of tuna. Have ready 1/2 cup of sliced olives.  6. Fold the tuna, almonds and olives gently into the gelatin mixture. Place  the mixture into the greased mold and chill until firm. Unmold onto a bed  of lettuce and decorate, using olives for the "eyes".    Serving Ideas : Prepare this in a fish mold for a special salad.
