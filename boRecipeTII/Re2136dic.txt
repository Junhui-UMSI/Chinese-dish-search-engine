Applesauce Chutney
Ground allspice, Ground clove, Chopped apples; peeled and, Raisins, Sugar; or up to 2-cups, White vinegar, Cinnamon, Finely chopped fresh ginger, 
Wash 2 pint jars with lids, or 4 half-pint jars with lids; set aside.    Combine the apples, raisins, ginger, sugar, vinegar and spices in a large  saucepan. Place over medium-low heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until the apples are tender  enough to mash with a fork. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.    Mash and stir the chutney until it is almost smooth. Dont worry about  little lumps as long as the apples are soft.    Ladle the chutney into the jars, leaving about 1/2 inch of head- space in  the jar. Put the lids snugly on and let cool.    Refrigerate the chutney if you will be using it within a week or two, or  freeze for longer storage. Yields 4 cups.
