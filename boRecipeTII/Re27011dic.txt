Three Ways with Pears
Ripe pears, Red wine or red grape juice, Syrup, Mint sprigs; for decoration, White wine or jasmine tea, Icing sugar; for decoration, 
Take four ripe pears, peel, core and quarter two of them and freeze them.  Carefully peel the other two pears and poach one in red wine and one in  white. If you prefer not to use wine, poach one in jasmine tea and one in  red grape juice.    Halve the pears and remove the core. Put the frozen pears in the blender or  food processor with 3 to 4 tablespoons syrup and blend until smooth.    You can make this before dinner and it will retain its soft texture in the  freezer for a couple of hours. When ready to serve, arrange the two pear  halves and some sorbet on chilled plates and serve immediately. Mint sprigs  and a dusting of icing sugar decorate the plate simply.
