Combine oil, vanilla, and  eggs, and add to flour mixture, stirring until well-blended.    Turn dough out onto a baking sheet coated with cooking spray; shape dough  into a 12-inch-long roll, and flatten to 1/2-inch thickness.  Combine water  and egg white; stir well. Brush over dough.    Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Remove from baking sheet to a wire  rack, and let cool.    Slice roll diagonally into 26 (1/2-inch) slices. Place slices, cut sides  down, on a baking sheet. Brush slices with egg white mixture, and sprinkle  evenly with turbinado sugar.    Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until dry. Let cool on wire racks.  Yield: 26 cookies (serving size: 1 cookie).    NOTES : 1-1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar may be substituted for the 1-1/2  tablespoons turbinado sugar.
