Quick Fudge Cookies
3 cups oats, milk, Sugar, Vanilla, Butter /margerine, Shreaded coconut., 6 Tbls. Cocoa powder, 
In a saucepan, boil (2 1/2 min.) butter, sugar, milk, & cocoa. Remove  from heat. Add vanilla, oats, and cocoanut (Stir it in quickly!) Drop  on wax paper to harden-- appx. 1/2 hour.    **note** Try NOT to eat all of the batter before it cools. The result  is a tummy ache that disturbs the full enjoyment of the finished  product (at least for an hour.) And you would have to make more  batter!!!!
