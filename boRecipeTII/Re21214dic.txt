Line pan with foil, allowing foil  to extend over two sides.  Butter foil. Melt both chocolates and butter in  heavy medium saucepan over very low heat, stirring until smooth. Cool. Sift  flour and salt into small bowl.  Mix cream, espresso powder and creme de  menthe in small cup. Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in large  bowl until frothy.  Fold in coffee mixture and then melted chocolate. Fold  in dry ingredients.  Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake until  toothpick inserted in center comes out with some moist crumbs still  attached, about 25 minutes (surface may crack). Gently press down on any  raised surfaces to flatten slightly. Cool 30 minutes on rack. FOR GLAZE:  Melt both chocolates and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat,  stirring until smooth.  Let stand until cool enough to spread. Spread glaze  over brownies. Let stand 4 hours at room temperature. Lift brownies from  pan using foil sides.  Cut into squares.  (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Store in airtight container.)
