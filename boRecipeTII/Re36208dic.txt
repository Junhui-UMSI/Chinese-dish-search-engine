Remove  from heat and let stand, covered, while completeing recipe. Trim stem ends  off mushrooms and discard. Wipe mushrooms with a damp paper towel and slice  thin. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a medium sized skillet and saute  mushrooms until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and  reserve. Cut a small X in the root end of each pearl onion. Bring a large  kettle of water to a boil and drop in the onions. Blanch for 10 minutes,  drain, and rinse under cold running water. Peel the onions. Heat another 2  tablespoons of butter in the same skillet and saute the onions, stirring  and shaking the skillet often, until they are lightly browned, 3 to 4  minutes. Transfer the onions to the bowl with the mushrooms. Cut the meat  into thin slices on the diagonal. Heat remaining butter in the skillet and  saute the pieces of filet over high heat until just lightly browned.  Transfer pieces to a plate as each batch is browned. Recipe can be prepared  to this point several hours before serving. To complete, set sauce over  medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add mushrooms, onions and any  accumulated juices from the bowl, and simmer for 5 minutes. Add slices of  filet and any accumulated juices and simmer until the meat is heated  through, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately over buttered noodles. Garnish  with chopped parsley. Garnish side with sauteed cherry tomatoes and pour a  good red wine.
