Quail Egg Hors Doevres
See below, 
In hors-doeuvre trays, cut them in half take out the yolks & mash  them with a little dijon mustard & mayonnaise until its a light  consistancy but not runny.  Take the egg white part & fill the cavity  with the caviar of your choice. Fill the cavity of a small pastry  tube withh a star tip & top the caviar with the yolk mixture. Now if  your on a limited budget or can take or leave the caviar, do the  opposite. Fill the white with the yolk mixture & top with caviar.
