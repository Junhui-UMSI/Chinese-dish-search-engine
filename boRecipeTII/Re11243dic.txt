* Enough pastry to equal about a 10-inch double crust pie.    1. Saute ground beef in large skillet until browned. Drain, and to the beef  add the onions, raisins, olives, salt and pepper. Cover and cook over low  heat for 5 minutes. 2. Stir in cottage cheese and chopped hard cooked egg.  Set aside. 3. Prepare pastry according to directions on container or make  your own recipe. Roll out the dough in two large circles (for easier  handling). Cut about 12 circles total, each about 3-1/2 inches in diameter.  Onto each circle place 2 teaspoons of filling. Brush edge of dough with 1  egg white mixed with 1 teaspoon of water. Fold edges over to make half-moon  shape and seal with fork dipped in flour. 4. Place Empanaditas on ungreased  cookie sheet. Blend the egg yolk with the milk and brush this mixture on  the tops of the Empanaditas. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven until golden  brown, about 15-18 minutes.
