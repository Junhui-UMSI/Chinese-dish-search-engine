Perserved Whole Kumquats
Water, Kumquats, Sugar, Sugar (see below), Light corn syrup, 
Wash kumquats thoroughly in warm water. Cover with water and boil  until furit is tender (about 10 minutes). Dont let fruit get too  soft. Drain. Make a slit down side of each kumquat and press out  seeds or remove by probing with fork. Make syrup of 2 cup sugar,  corn-syrup and water. Boil 2 minutes, add kumquats and cook gently  for 10 minutes. Set aside for several hours or overnight. Add 1/2 cup  sugar and head to boiling. Simmer 5 minutes. Repeat this standing and  adding sugar process 2 or 3 more times (3 or 4 times in all). Simmer  5 minures each time. (If kumquats are put into heavy syrup at first  they will collapse. Failure to slit the fruit may cause collapse. The  time and temperature should be checked, too long or hot cooking tends  to make these preserves dark and strong in flavor.)
