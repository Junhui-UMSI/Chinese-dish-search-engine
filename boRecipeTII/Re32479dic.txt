Basic Bread and Dough Recipe (Sourdough)
Bread, Pita bread, Tortillas, 
For the dough I used: (more or less on the quantities) 1 cup white flour 2  cups whole wheat 1 teaspoon yeast 1 cup sour dough 1 tablespoon honey 1 cup  water and then watch it if you need more water or more flour    By the way I use these same things and quantities to make my bread. In the  bread I add various things, for instance caraway seeds, or garlic, or  raisins, whatever I feel like The bread always comes out good. So this is  my always recipe for bread or dough.
