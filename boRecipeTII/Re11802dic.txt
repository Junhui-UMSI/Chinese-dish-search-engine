basic pasta, Italian sausage, Ricotta, Pecorino, Salt and pepper, Eggs, nutmeg, Butter, FILLING, Swiss chard, 
In a bowl, combine cooked sausage, chopped chard, ricotta, Pecorino, eggs  and nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.    Lay out 1 sheet of pasta on a work surface and dot with 1/2 tablespoons  filling 2-inches apart. Lay second sheet over and press with hands to seal.  Using a pizza cutter, cut out squares and set aside.    Bring 6 quarts water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt. Place ravioli in  boiling water and cook until tender, about 4 to 5 minutes.    Melt butter in a 12-inch to 14-inch saute pan and remove from heat.  Carefully drain ravioli and place in pan with butter. Toss gently over  medium heat, sprinkle with remaining cheese and serve.
