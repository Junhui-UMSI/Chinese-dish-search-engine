Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Peel the bananas and cut crosswise and  lengthwise into halves.  Arrange in a buttered baking dish.  Combine the  cornstarch, sugar, and orange juice.  Pour the mixture over the bananas,  coating well.  Dot with the butter and sprinkle with the brown sugar and  coconut.  Bake for about 30 minutes or until the bananas are tender and the  sauce is thickened.  Can serve this with either whipped cream or ice cream.
