On the bottom, 2 cans bean dip - we usually use Tostitos black bean dip -  it is spicier    Next - guacamole - We make ours by adding lemon juice, tabasco or other hot  sauce, and salsa to the avocados    Third layer - 16 ounce sour cream with a package taco seasoning mixed in  (can add a little mayo to this if ya like)    Fourth layer - chopped green onion    Fifth - sliced black olives    Sixth - diced tomato    Seventh - Shredded sharp cheddar    That is it - we use toritlla chips or Fritos, but it is so good we have  been known to use anything to dip it out with!!
