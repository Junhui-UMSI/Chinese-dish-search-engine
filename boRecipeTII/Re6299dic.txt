Plain Pastry for 1-Crust Pie
Cold water; ( I use cold, Plus 1 tablespoon vegetable, Salt, Flour, 
(from Farm Journals Complete Pie Cookbook)    Combine flour and salt in bowl. Cut in shortening with pastry blender or  with two knives until mixture is the consistency of coarse cornmeal or tiny  peas. Sprinkle on cold water or milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing  mixture lightly and stirring with fork. Add water or milk each time to the  driest part of the mixture. The dough should be just moist enough to hold  together when pressed gently with a fork. It should not be sticky.    Shape dough in smooth ball with hands, and roll. Or if you are not ready to  make the pie, wrap it in waxed paper and refrigerate 30 minutes or until  ready to make your pie. Bake pie shell in a very hot oven (450 degrees)  from 10 to 15 minutes or until browned the way you like it. Cool before  filling.
