1. Cut cutlets crosswise into thirds. Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and  the pepper in shallow dish; lightly coat both sides of turkey.    2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add turkey and cook, just until golden brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Transfer to platter; keep warm.    3. Add mushrooms, onion, thyme, remaining 1 teaspoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon  salt to skillet. Cook, stirring, until mushrooms are brown and onion is  tender, 5 minutes. Add broth and wine. Boil 1 minute. Return turkey to  skillet. Sprinkle with parsley.    Notes: Adding wine to low-fat dishes is a culinary trick the pros use. As  the alcohol cooks off, it intensifies the flavor of the other ingredients.
