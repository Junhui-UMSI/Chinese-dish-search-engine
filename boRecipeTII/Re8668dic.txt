Source Sunset magzine, September 1975 issue where there are a number of  other terrific middle eastern recipes    Cut onions into lengthwise slices, place into frying pan with the live oil.  Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently until onions are richly browned  ~ about a half hour. At the same time rinse lentils and put in a 3-4 quart  saucepan with the water, bring to a boil, turn to simmer and cover. After  20 minutes add rice, salt, and pepper. Reserve 1/2 C of the cooked onions  and add balance to the lentil/rice mixture. Cook until rice is tender and  fluffed - about 25 minutes. Serve hot or at room temp with reserved onions  arranged over the top. It makes a nice accompaniement to meat or as a main  course served with a cucumber/yogurt salad    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #033 by Ron Parker  <rbparker@henning.cfa.org> on Jan 27, 1997.
