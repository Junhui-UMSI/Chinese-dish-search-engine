Source: Epicurious - Gourmet Sept. 1992    Cut off the top third ofg each tomato, scoop out the seeds and pulp with a  grapefruit knife, leaving 1/3 inch thick shells, and reserve the tops and  pulp for another use. Sprinkle the insides of the tomatoes with salt and  invert the tomatoes on a rack to drain, for 30 minutes    In a non-stick skillet heat 1 Tablespoon of the oil over moderately-high  heat until it is hot, but not smoking, and in it saute the scrod for 1  minute on each side. Add the wine to the skillet and cook the fish, covered  for 3 to 6 minutes, or until it just flakes. Remove the skillet from the  heat and let the fish cool. Flake the fish into a bowl and stir in the  preserved lemon peel and brine, the coriander, the lemon juice, and 2  Tablespoons of the remaining oil. Divide the mixture among the tomato  shells and drizzle it with the remaining 1 Tablespoon oil.    QUICK PRESERVED LEMONS: In a baking dish just large enough to hold the  lemons in one layer, toss the lemons with the salt, pour enough lemon juice  over them to just cover them and bake the lemons, covered, in a pre-heated  oven of 200*F, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours. Let the lemons cool and  transfer them with their brine to an airtight container. The preserved  lemons keep, covered and chilled, indefinitely.
