Twelve Layer Jello Salad
sour cream, Jello, 
Level your refrigerator. Cool a 9"x13" Pyrex pan in the refrigerator for a  few hours. Dissolve 1 box Jello in 1 cup boiling water. Divide in half. To  one half, add 3 Tablespoons cold water and pour into chilled pan. Return to  refrigerator and let set about 1/2 hour. To the other half add 1/3 cup sour  cream. When clear layer is set, pour this layer on top. Let set about 1/2  hour. Repeat steps with another box of Jello. Keep adding layers,  alternating clear and creamy.    I usually cover it with plastic wrap when it is finished, but to keep the  plastic wrap from sticking to the top layer and pulling it away, I insert  toothpicks, evenly spaced, and kind of tent the plastic wrap over the  jello.
