Baked Apple Butter
Oranges; juiced, Cinnamon, Brown sugar or honey, Lemons; juiced, Water or apple juice, Salt, Jonathon apples; or another, 
Heat oven to 350F. Peel, core and cut apples into quarters. Place in large  baking pan or oven kettle. Cover apples with water, apple juice or any  combination of the two. Cover and bake for about 1 1/2 hours. Uncover, add  cinnamon, brown sugar and salt and mash with a potato masher, then stir  well. Cover and bake again for about 4 hours, stirring about every hour  until mixture is reduced, brown and thick. This is all relative to your  baking vessel. For my heavy copper kettle it takes all day. Prepare hot  sterile jars. Stir in orange and lime juice and add more sugar if desired.  Put into jars and seal.    Recipe by Mangia!
