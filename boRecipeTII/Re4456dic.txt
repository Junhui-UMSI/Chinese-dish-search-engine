Pesto Chicken
Mozzarella cheese, Boneless, skinless chicken, olive oil, Salt and pepper, Pesto, Mushrooms, 
Place the chicken breasts between sheets of wax paper and pound until thin.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium  heat and lightly brown the chicken on both sides. Remove the pan from the  heat.    Spread 1 tablespoon pesto over each chicken breast. <Honestly, most of the  time I use the packaged DiGiorno stuff in the dairy aisle. I think its  excellent and SOOOOO much easier than making my own.>    Cover each piece with a slice of cheese. Place the mushrooms in the pan  around the chicken. Cover and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes or  until done.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 27 Feb 97 by Elyse G Nathanson <jordanzmom@JUNO.COM>  on Feb 28, 1997.
