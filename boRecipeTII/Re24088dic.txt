1. Combine all ingredients. .SH SYRUP:    1. Combine all of the above in a saucepan, and let simmer for 10 minutes.  Let cool. Discard peels and cinnamon. .SH BAKLAVA:    1. Unwrap filo dough and fold in half, like the pages of a book. Keep  covered with a dry kitchen towel while working (or just work fast). Turn  over one sheet onto 25x38 cm cookie sheet. Brush with melted margarine,  using soft 4-5 cm brush or fingertips.    2. Continue turning sheets (pages) and brushing with margarine until 1/3 of  the sheets have been used. Cover with half of the nut filling.    3. Brush another 1/3 of the pages and place over the nuts in the pan. Top  with remaining nut filling, and then continue with the remaining sheets of  filo dough. Brush top sheet with remaining margarine.    4. With sharp knife, score pastry into diamonds, squares, or triangles.  Bake at 180 ?C for 35-45 minutes until puffed, crisp, and deep golden in  color.    5. Remove from oven and immediately pour cooled Syrup over baklava. Let  stand 4 hours. (Thats what the recipe says, but Ive never been able to do  it). When cool, cut through to the bottom layer in scored cuts.    Difficulty : moderate/fiddly. Precision  : measure ingredients.
