A lot of trouble, but a conversation piece when finished. Old time cooks  called these and stuffed whole fruits "mangoes." They were favorites in  English-American homes because the flavor is superb with baked ham, game,  roast pork, and with baked beans. Serve whole as a salad, or slice and use  as garnish.    Wash all vegetables thoroughly before chopping; drain peppers; cut off tops  and save; remove seeds and membranes. Cover tops and peppers with water and  bring to boiling; boil gently 10 minutes, or until almost tender. Drain,  and let cool.  Combine chopped vegetables. Mix remaining ingredients; pour  over vegetables and mix well. Stuff into peppers, do not pack too tightly.  Place top on each pepper.  Tie in place with string. Place peppers in wide  mouthed jars or in a large crock or jar.
