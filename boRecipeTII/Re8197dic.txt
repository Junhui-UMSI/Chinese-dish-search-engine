Potato Gnocchi
baking potatoes, Salt, Pasta sauce, Whole wheat pastry flour, 
Gnocchi are little dumplings that are eaten like pasta. Flour gnocchi are  good, but potato gnocchi are superb.    Steam the potatoes in their skins until tender. When they are cool enough  to handle, peel and mash. Immediately add the flour and salt. Knead on a  lightly floured board until smooth. Sprinkle on a little more flour if the  dough sticks. Form into rolls about the thickness of your thumb. Cut into  3/4-inch sections and perss down lightly with a fork. Bring a large pot of  lightly salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and boil until they rise to  the top, about 5 minutes. Like all pasta, gnocchi should not be crowded in  the pot, so cook them in several batches if necessary. Drain and place in a  warm bowl. Mix the gnocchi with enough sauce to thoroughly coat them. Extra  sauce can be added at the table according to taste.    (She also has a recipe for sweet potato gnocchi which sounds great.  Proportions are exactly the same - just substitute 2 lbs sweet potatoes to        2    lbs baking potatoes.)    from High Road to Health by Lindsay Wagner and Ariane Spade.
