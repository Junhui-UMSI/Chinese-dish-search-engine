It is a family favorite and often requested by friends for a  weekly coffee get-together.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, mix first ingredients; the  mixture will be thick.  Stir in chopped apple.  Spray a pie pan with no  stick spray. Put mixture in the pan and bake for about 35 minutes.    I especially like to use Fuji apples.  Before baking I sprinkle the top of  the batter with a touch of cinnamon sugar.  We enjoy this warm but it is ok  cold too!    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #113    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
