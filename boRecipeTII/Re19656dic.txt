Another Chocolate Cheesecake
Eggs, (8 oz) cream cheese;, Sugar, Unsalted butter; melted, Vanilla, Whipping cream, (8 1/2 oz) chocolate wafers;, Or 2 cups semi-sweet, Kahlua, Unsalted butter; melted, 
Heat oven to 325F. In medium bowl, combine wafers and butter, reserving 1  tablespoon of the crumbs for garnish. Press remaining crumbs in bottom and  2 inches up sides of an ungreased 10-inch springform pan. Refrigerate.    In a large bowl, combine cream cheese and sugar; beat until smooth. Add  eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add melted chocolate;  beat well. Add remaining ingredients, and beat until smooth. Pour into  crust-lined pan.    Bake at 325F for 55 to 65 minutes or until edges are set. Center of  cheesecake will be soft. (To minimize cracking, place a shallow pan with  about 3/4 inch of hot water on the lower oven rack while baking.) Allow  cheesecake to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then carefully remove the  sides of the pan. Allow the cheesecake to cool completely. Garnish with the  reserved crumbs (provided you can keep your spouse from eating them), and  refrigerate (at least 2-3 hours, preferably overnight). Keeps well in  refrigerator for 3 days, probably longer, but who can keep from eating it  before then?
