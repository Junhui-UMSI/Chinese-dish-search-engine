Strawberry Snow (Mansikkalumi)
Whole strawberries, to 16, Heavy cream, stiffly whipped, Fresh hulled strawberries,, (10 oz) frozen whole, Sugar, Egg whites, Salt, 
( A Finnish Dessert)    With the back of a large spoon, rub the fresh or thoroughly defrosted  frozen strawberries through a fine sieve into a small mixing bowl. Stir  into this puree the 1/2 cup sugar, a little at a time. Using a balloon-type  wire whisk, beat the egg whites and salt vigorously in a large bowl  (preferably of unlined copper) until the whites are stiff enough to form  unweavering peaks when the beater is lifted out of the bowl. With a gentle  under-over cutting motion rather than a stirring motion, use a rubber  spatula to fold first the strawberry puree and then the whipped cream into  the egg whites. Pour the strawberry snow into an attractive serving bowl,  or individual dessert bowls, and decorate with the whole strawberries. This  dessert can be served at once, or it may be refrigerated for a few hours  and served later in the day.
