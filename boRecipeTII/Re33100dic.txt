Basic Foccacia
Chiffonade of basil, all-purpose flour, olive oil, Yeast, Roma tomato, BASIC DOUGH, Sugar, Salt, Grated Parmesan cheese, Warm water, TOPPING, 
In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water. Sprinkle the yeast  over that mixture and    let stand for 10 minutes, to bloom (it should begin to foam). In the mixer  bowl with the dough hook attached, add 3 cups of flour, salt and yeast  mixture. Slowly turn it on and work the dough together. Turn it up to  medium and mix for 5 minutes. If the dough is sticky, continue mixing and  gradually add the remaining flour. Place this smooth ball of dough into an  oiled bowl, cover and set aside to rise for 3 hours.    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Punch down the dough, and remove it from  the bowl onto a lightly oiled, 9-inch by 13-inch sheet tray. Spread the  dough out onto the sheet tray. Using your fingertips, make "dimples" in the  dough. Drizzle the dough with olive oil, sprinkle on the basil, spread out  the tomato slices, sprinkle on the cheese and bake for 30 - 35 minutes.
