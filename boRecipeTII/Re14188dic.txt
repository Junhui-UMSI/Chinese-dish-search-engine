White Mountain Frosting (Microwave)
Egg whites, Vanilla, Sugar, Water, Light corn syrup, 
Combine sugar, corn syrup and water in 1-quart casserole. Cook in microwave  oven on full power for about 3-4 minutes, or until it spins a thread when  dropped from a spoon. (The mixture starts bubbling slowly while cooking in  the microwave.)    Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Continue beating, pouring hot syrup  in thin stream and then vanilla into egg whites. Beat until stiff peaks  form. Spread on cake.    NOTES : This frosting is excellent on a package chocolate cake mix, topped  with toasted pecan pieces sprinkled on top.
