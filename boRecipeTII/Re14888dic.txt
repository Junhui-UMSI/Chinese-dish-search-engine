Preparation time: 2 hours Cooking time: 15 to 20 minutes     1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ready ungreased baking sheets.   2. Beat butter in large bowl of electric mixer until light and fluffy.  Beat in half of the flour, the sugar, vanilla and water until thoroughly  combined.  Beat in the remaining flour.   3. Use a scant 1 tablespoon of dough and press it flat and thin with your  hands. Put a chocolate mint wafer in the center and fold the dough over to  completely cover each chocolate and to form a neat, rectangular package.  Pinch the edges to seal. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.    4. Bake until bottoms are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool a few  minutes on the baking sheets and then cool completely on wire racks.   5. For icing, mix confectioners sugar and milk to make a thin icing;  color icing as desired. Use a small spatula to ice cookies. Decorate as  desired so cookies resemble Christmas packages.     For variety, second-place winner Carol Feezell of Skokie, Illinois uses  several kinds of miniature candies in her pretty cookies. She suggests  filling the cookies with chocolate mint wafers, such as Andes, or Hersheys  Miniatures. We also enjoyed Lindts orange chocolate thins when we made the  cookies in the Tribune test kitchen. from the Chicago Tribune seventh  annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 8, 1994  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #338    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Tue, 10 Dec 1996 12:22:58 +0000
