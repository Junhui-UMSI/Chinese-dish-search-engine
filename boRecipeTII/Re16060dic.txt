1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a small saucepan, combine honey and  lemon juice and cook over low heat, stirring, until honey melts. Lightly  brush outside of figs with honey mixture. Cut figs in half and place cut  side up on a baking sheet. Lightly brush cut surfaces with honey mixture.  Bake until warmed through and slightly softened (7 to 10 minutes). Remove  from oven and let stand 10 minutes.    2. To serve, place warm figs on a platter accompanied by Gorgonzola in one  piece. Or, serve each guest a small plate with 2 fig halves and a small  wedge of Gorgonzola. If desired, Gorgonzola can be blended with cream  cheese for a milder flavor and packed into a crock.
