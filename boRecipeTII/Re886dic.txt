Honey-Lime Vinaigrette
Honey, Dijon mustard, Rice wine vinegar, Lime juice; from 5 limes, Lime zest; from 5 limes, olive oil, 
With a zester, remove zest from five limes and set aside for  garnish.Squeeze limes through strainer into med bowl. Remove any seeds and  add any pulp that was caught to the juice. Add the mustard, and vinegar and  whisk to mix. Add the olive oil in a stream, whisking briskly. Pour over  salad and serve.    NOTES : I used this on a chicken-pasta salad.  The amounts are approximate,  but the ratios are about right.  Since I usually only make enough for the  salad at hand, I have no idea how long it would keep.  For an oriental or  Mexican type salad I would add chopped cilantro and maybe a touch of ground  cumin.  This would go well with a Cristianos y Morros (black beans and  rice) salad.
