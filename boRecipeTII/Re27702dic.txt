http://www.bassangler.com/articles/jp34.htm    After eliminating as much exterior fat as possible, cut a beef eye-of-round  (London broil will do) into long strips approximately 1/3 to 1/2 inch  square (slice with the grain of the meat). (Deer, moose, elk, and caribou  are also fine, but use lean cuts and slice with the grain.) Mix all  marinate ingredients, except the pepper. Use the following formula for the  hot sauce:          1    shake for pussycats          2    shakes for good amigos          4    shakes for tough hombres    19 shakes for snotty neighbors and former spouses    Place marinate and meat in a ziplock bag. Squeeze out the air and seal.  Place in a bowl/pan in the refrigerator for 2 - 24 hours (longer gives a  deeper flavor).    Line a large roasting pan with aluminum foil and place wire cake racks in  it. Spray the racks with a non-stick cooking spray (Pam, etc.). Lay the  marinated meat strips across the racks and sprinkle liberally with very  coarse-ground black pepper. Place in an electric stove oven for about 7-8  hours on the very lowest warm setting (I like 11pm to 6am). Additionally,  the oven door should be cracked open an inch or so to allow the moisture to  escape (a metal kitchen spoon does fine). Over-curing (drying) will make  the jerky dry and brittle, so be careful.    The beef in this recipe can also be dried nicely in a dehydrator.    This jerky needs no refrigeration for a least two weeks. After that, I  dont how long it will keep because it always gets eaten too fast. However,  I would use common sense. If green things (literal interpretation: mold)  start growing on it, toss it.    Tips:    1. Before slicing, put the meat in the freezer until just firm (2 hr.); it  will slice much more easily and uniformly.    2. You can slice the strips of meat thin and wide, like bacon, if you like.  However, dont make them too thin or they will be crisp.    3. An electric food slicer save time and gives a uniform thickness to the  meat. Be sure not to set it too thin.    4. Make a small batch the first time and see whether your taste will want  more/less garlic, salt, brown sugar, etc. The `heaviness of the  Worcestershire sauce can be diluted with water, if need be.    5. Store in a zip-lock bag for freshness.    6. Be sure to cut WITH THE GRAIN of the meat when slicing!    6. Hide some if you expect to have any the next day. It will go fast!!!
