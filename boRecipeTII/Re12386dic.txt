Its adapted from a Hare Krishna cookbook, -Great Vegetarian  Dishes, Over 240 recipes from around the world- by Kurma dasa.    1. Saute the cumin seeds in a couple of tablespoons of water or vegetable  broth in a large, heavy non-stick pan or wok until the seeds darken a few  shades. Add the chilies, asafoetida and turmeric and a couple more  tablespoons of water or broth and stir briefly. Add the green peppers and  stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.    2. Add the zucchini and ground coriander and, stirring occasionally, cook  the vegetables for an additional two minutes. Add a little more water or  broth if it starts looking too dry. Add the tomato pieces, mix well and  reduce the heat to moderately low, stirring occasionally. Cook until the  zucchini becomes translucent and soft but not mushy. Add the salt, sugar  and herbs. Stir to mix, remove from the heat, and serve hot. Note - this is  obviously meant to be quite a dry curry, judging by the photograph in the  book. However, if Im serving it with rice or couscous, I keep adding  tomatoes until its nice and sloppy.
