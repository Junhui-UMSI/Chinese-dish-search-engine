Banana-Cranberry Juice-Tofu Smoothie
Box Mori-Nu lite tofu, Cranberry juice, Peeled bananas; frozen or, Maple syrup, 
Break bananas into 3" pieces and put in blender. Add the tofu, broken up a  bit. Pour cranberry juice in to almost cover. Blend, adding more juice if  mixture seems too thick. Add maple syrup while blending. Vary the texture  to your preference, I like it at yogurt consistency. Pour some over a  cooked bowl of oatmeal and swirl in.    This will make a full blender of smoothie, enough for 4-6 bowls of oatmeal.  I store the leftover smoothie in a glass container in the refrigerator,  where it often mysteriously disappears :-) For some reason, it tastes like  a strawberry shake.    You can often buy ripe bananas for very little money. I buy large  quantities, peel them, break them into three pieces, and freeze them in zip  loc bags. For those that have had trouble with frozen bananas in their  blenders, maybe its the blender? I bought an Oster, which was about $10  more than the others, because I wanted the glass container. This blender  model seems to have a very sturdy little motor in it.    Posted to fatfree digest by Anne Cox <coxa@pilot.msu.edu> on Feb 19, 1998
