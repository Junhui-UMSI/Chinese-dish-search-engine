Beat eggs until well mixed. Add the milk, salt and pepper. Heat ghee in a  large, heavy frying pan and cook the spring onions, chillies and ginger  until soft. Add turmeric, coriander leaves and tomato and fry for a minute  or two longer, then stir in the egg mixture and the ground cummin. Cook  over low heat, stirring and lifting the eggs as they begin to set on the  base of the pan. Mix and cook until the eggs are of a creamy  consistency-they should not be cooked until dry. Turn on a serving plate  and garnish with tomato and coriander. Serve with chapatis or parathas or  just plain bread.    Compiled by Imran C.
