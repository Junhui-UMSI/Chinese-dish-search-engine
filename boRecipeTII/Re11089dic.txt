Rainy Day Porter
Boil, (pale), (amber), Brown sugar, Crystal (60 degree L), Crystal (40 degree L), Chocolate Malt, AAU, Alexander extract syrup, Roasted Barley, Fresh Grated Ginger; 10, Yellow Dog extract syrup, Black Patent, Minutes boil, (2 ounce Nugget) 60 minutes, Cascade, Ale yeast (see comments), 
Steep  grains  at 150 degrees for 40 minutes before boil. Add  malt  and  brown  sugar. Boil for 60 minutes. Add Nugget hops at begining of  boil.  Add ginger last 10 minutes of boil. Turn off heat and add Cascade  hops.  Allow  to steep for 10 minutes. Cool wort with chiller. Rack  off  trub.  Add water to make total about 5.3 gallons.  Pitch yeast. Bottle 3  weeks  later. I used two types of yeast pitched simultaneously for this brew. One  was 5 grams (rehydrated) Doric Ale yeast, and the other was a "large"  sample taken from a previous (cherry ale) brew a few weeks earlier,  originally Whitbred Ale yeast. Obviously, this is a very heavy ale, almost  like  a stout. Id liken the flavor to Sierra Nevadas porter, but heavier,  a little sweeter, and with (delicious) ginger. After about 3 weeks in the  bottle,  it was, uh, WOW!!! Delicious!! What a combination  of  flavors!  Id say that this is the correct amount of ginger for such a dark, heavy  ale  (for my taste). Ive had (lighter) ales with too much  ginger,  but  this was just right.
