Granny smith apple, Caramels, Eagle brand sweetened milk, Butter, 
From: howard@cs.uiuc.edu    Date: Wed, 13 Oct 1993 20:56:27 GMT  You will need Granny Smith or Jonathon Apples for this recipe - you really  need a TART apple to counter the SWEETNESS of this...    Unwrap (1) 16oz package of caramels  - then add butter - then add can  milk... put in microwave for several minutes - be careful not to scorch...  I pull mine out and stir it every so often -    The nice thing about this is that you can use it and then keep the  leftovers in the frig and just reheat in microwave - it still is as fresh  as when you made it. The butter helps with this.    ENJOY - I usually slice my apple - however, we have been known to drizzle  this over popcorn - and have cream cheese on the side to serve with it. It  is delicious but VERY RICH!!!!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
