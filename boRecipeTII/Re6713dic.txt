Seeing I havent posted in quite a while, I thought that I would post  lowfat from the Taste of Home Lowfat Country Cooking. Out of 455 recipes I  only have 44 formatted. Plan on formatting the rest this week. Hope you all  enjoy these.    In a bowl, combine flour, sugar if desired and salt. In another bowl,  lightly beat egg; add mink and oil. Add to dry ingredients and stir until  smooth. Fold in apples. Heat a griddle coated with nonstick cooking spray;  pour batter by 1/2 cupfuls onto hot griddle and spread to form a 5-inch  circle. Turn when bubbles begin to form on top. Cook until the second side  is golden brown and apples are tender. Dust with confectioners sugar if  desired.    Serving Size: 2 pancakes    NOTES : My Mom used to make these wonderful pancakes for me as an  after-school snack.  Now I serve them as a main course or as a side dish  with a variety of breakfast entrees.
