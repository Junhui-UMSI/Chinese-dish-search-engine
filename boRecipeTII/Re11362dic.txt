Turmeric, Pimientos; Canned, Cut In, Rice; Uncooked, Fryer; Cut Up, Chili powder, Salad oil, Garlic, Onions, Chicken broth, Pepper, Salt, Seasoned Flour, Green Pepper; Diced, 
Coat chicken by rolling in seasoned flour. Brown in hot oil. Remove from  skillet. Cook onions, garlic, and green peppers in same skillet until  golden. Add pimiento, rice, turmeric and spices. Stir over low heat about  two minutes. Add remaining ingredients. Heat to boiling. Pour into 3 quart  casserole. Arrange chicken on top. Bake 350F for about 1 hour until chicken  is cooked.    Note: I do not use canned pimiento in this recipe but use instead some  diced red pepper for colour.
