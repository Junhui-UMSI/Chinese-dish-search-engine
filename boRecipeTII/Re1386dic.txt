Egg Stuffed Zucchini
Zucchini squash, Water, Tomato, chopped, Butter or margarine, Eggs, Salt, Dash pepper, Shredded sharp cheese, 
Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise, scoop out the pulp, leaving 1/4" of  the shell. Chop the pulp, reserve and set aside 1 cup. Place zucchini  shells, cut side down in a large skillet, add the water and simmer until  just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and turn zucchini over so cut side is  up in skillet, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. In another skillet cook  the pulp and tomato in butter until tender, for about 3 minutes. Add the  eggs, the 1/4 tsp salt, and dash of pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring  once or twice. Remove from heat when just set, spoon into the zucchini  shells and top with the cheese. Cover and heat until cheese melts. serves 4    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Paula <demoness@bellatlantic.net> on Aug  24, 1998
