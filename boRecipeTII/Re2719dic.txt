I didnt have one on the computer or in my Fleishmanns recipe book  (ordered from a jar of their yeast - good book), but they have a WWW site  at: http://www.breadworld.com/    This is a real treasure trove of baking info, and on doing a search of the  site, found the following recipe. Dont know if it is what you are looking  for, but its the best I can do. Havent tried it yet myself, but intend  doing so.    Jelly sandwiches made with this bread received rave reviews from our taste  panel of kids. As one panel member put it: "You know what I like about this  bread? It doesnt stick to the roof of my mouth."    Add ingredients to bread machine pan in the order suggested by  manufacturer, adding peanut butter with milk. (If dough is too dry or stiff  or too soft or slack, adjust dough consistency - see Adjusting Dough  Consistency tip below.)    Recommended cycle: Basic/white bread cycle; light or medium/normal color  setting.
