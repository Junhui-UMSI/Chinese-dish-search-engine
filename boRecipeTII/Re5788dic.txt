From: viv@higgs.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi)    Date: Sat, 12 Feb 94 18:44:03 +1100  In response to a recent request for recipes for some Italian biscuits/  cookies made with pignoli....here is a collection of a variety of different  types which are popular in Italy...I hope they please!!    In a food processor place the sugar, ground almonds, vanilla and egg  whites. Whirl for a minute or so, to form a smooth paste. Mix the whole  pine nuts into this mixture and with the help of a spoon form little mounds  the size of a walnut on an oiled baking sheet. Dry in the oven at 160C/325F  for 10-12 minutes. Serves 4 - 6.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
