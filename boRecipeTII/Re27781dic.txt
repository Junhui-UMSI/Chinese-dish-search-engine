RHUM PEPPER PAINT    To make the rhum pepper paint, toast the black peppercorns and the cloves  together in a dry skillet over moderately high heat until you see puffs of  smoke (about one minute). Grind them together in spice grinder. Transfer to  heavy sauce pan and ad the remaining ingredients and heat together over  medium heat.    Mixture will begin to foam as it reduces. When reduced by approx. one-half,  about 25-35 minutes, strain it through a fine-meshed strainer into a bowl.  Reserve until needed.    MANGO-HABANERO MOJO    Blend the mango, Chardonnay and orange juice together in a blender. Add the  minced habanero/chile and reserve.    METHOD    Just before serving, preheat oven to 450-deg. F. Paint the fish liberally  on the skin side only and store them on a plate. Warm the mojo in a small  saucepan until just barely hot.    Heat a large skillet until almost smoking hot. Add some peanut oil and  carefully add the fish, painted side down. Shake the pan to avoid sticking.    When fish is quite dark on painted side, flip it over, degrease the pan,  and place the pan into pre-heated oven. Bake the fish 7 - 9 minutes. Ladle  about 4 ounces of the mojo sauce onto each serving plate. Now remove the  fish from the pan and place it on top of the sauce. Serve with a wedge of  lime.    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !    NOTE: when making the rhum and pepper paint, the rum can suddenly ignite  when reducing. Be SURE to have a lid or another pan handy to cover the  paint pan. It will immediately extinguish the oxygen and the flame. The  lower the heat a touch, remove the lid, and proceed.    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !    NOTES : Rhum and pepper paint can be made up to one month ahead and kept  refrigerated until needed. Frm. Natl.
