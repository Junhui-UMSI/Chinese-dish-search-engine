Slivered Shallots, <<or>>, Dry sherry, Parsley, Good Gin, Rich Game Bird Or Chicken, Whole Pheasant, Salt, Vegetable oil, Juniper Berries, crushed, Salt, Bay Leaves, Thin Sheets Of Pork Fat,, Butter (Optional), 
Season the pheasant with salt and pepper and truss to help maintain its  shape. Completely wrap the bird with the pork fat, tying with twine if  necessary. In a heavy bottomed casserole, saute the bird until golden brown  on all sides. Remove the pheasant and pour off the fat. Add the oil and  shallots and saute until just beginning to color. Add the juniper, bay and  liquids and cover the casserole and simmer for 35-45 minutes or until bird  is tender (check at leg joint). Remove the pheasant to a serving platter,  discard fat wrap and keep warm. Strain braising liquid, discarding solids  and skim off fat. Reduce mixture quickly over high heat to a light sauce  consistency. Off heat, whisk in the parsley and butter and season with salt  and pepper. Carve pheasant into serving pieces. Pour sauce over and serve  immediately with roasted young vegetables, if desired.

You get a double shot of juniper berry in this recipe because it is  the berry used to give gin its special flavor  Recipe by: JOHN ASH SHOW #JA9759    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #389 by Bill Spalding <billspa@icanect.net>  on Jan 26, 1997.
