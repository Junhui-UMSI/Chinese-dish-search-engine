"Freds Schezuan Sauce"
Whole yellow mustard seed, Tomato juice, Shallot, Arrowroot, Garlic, White pepper, Sesame oil, Low salt tamari, Thai pepper, black pepper, Ground cumin, 
Well, this is NOT non-fat, but is low fat. Its kind of a Schezuan sauce I  guess, of my own invention. If I could figure out how to avoid using the  oil it would be non-fat, but anything Ive tried has been less than yummy.  Considering it makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce, and that goes a long way  (ie: 2 Tbs per serving, approx), the fat content per serving should be  about 1g due to the sauce. The flavor of the sesame oil is quite  indespensible, to me.    Its quite spicy, be warned! But its fantastic for vegetables over rice,  or with vegetables, grilled chicken, and rice noodles; or stirred into  plain wild rice. Experiment!    DIRECTIONS: =========== In a small skillet, saute the garlic, hot pepper,  shallot, and mustard seed in the oil until the garlic and shallots brown  and the mustard seeds begin to pop (best over high heat, but dont let the  oil burn).  Add the tomato juice, tamari, white pepper and cumin. Lower  heat and simmer 5 mins. In a smal cup mix 2 tsp cold water and the  arrowroot until smooth. Stir into sauce, stirring constantly. The sauce  should thicken in about a minute or two. Remove from heat and stir into  your favorite dish.    From: ft@maxwell.ccs.att.com (Frederick True)
