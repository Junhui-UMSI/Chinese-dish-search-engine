Tex-Mex Potatoes
Firm red or white potatoes, Chili powder, Tomato chopped, Mashed pinto beans, Scallions, chopped, (4 oz) can diced green, Ground cumin, Clove garlic, crushed, Chopped cilantro, Cilantro chopped, Salsa, Round onion chopped, Frozen corn kernals thawed, 
Preheat oven to 375    Scrub potatoes and cut lengthwise into wedges. Place on baking sheet, cut  side up. BAke until lightly browned, about 40 min.    Meanwhile combine beans, salsa, chilis, onion, garlic, cilantro, chili  powder, and cumin in a saucepan. Heat over very low heat for about 15 min.    Combine corn, tomato, scallions and cilantro. Set aside.    Place potato wedges on a large serving platter. Scoop bean mixture over the  potatoes. Finish (whatever that means) with the tomato-corn mixture. (I  guess that means put it on the top).    I dont know why I havent tried this one yet, it sure sounds good as I  type. Hope you enjoy it.    Michele
