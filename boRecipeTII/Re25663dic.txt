Eggs, Yoghurt or sour cream, Rum, vanilla, or amaretto, Bananas, very ripe, Flour, Baking soda, Walnuts, chopped, Shortening (butter), Sugar, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream the shortening and sugar. Mix in  the bananas.  Mix in the remaining ingredients. Pour into a greased loaf  pan. Bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees F.    NOTES:    *  This recipe is from my friend Ayalla -- It makes a heavy, but moist,  loaf of banana bread.    *  If you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, I suggest that you lower the  oven temperature and cook for a while longer. Otherwise, the crust comes  out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost  undercooked.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  Preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes. Allow some  time for cooling.  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.    : Aviva Garrett  : Santa Cruz, California, USA  : (Excelan, Inc., San Jose)  : ucbvax!mtxinu!excelan!aviva    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
