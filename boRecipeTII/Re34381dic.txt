Bean and Rice Burgers
Cornmeal, Cooked beans -- pink,, Cracked wheat, Pepper -- diced, Clove garlic -- mashed, Grated carrot, Spike or seasoning salt, Margarine or butter, Onion -- diced, Cooked brown rice, Cooked mashed potatoes, Wheat flour (or white), OPTIONAL, Bran, 
Heat greased (I use cooking spray) grill or electric frypan on med heat.  ***Or, you can grease a 13"x9" glass baking pan and bake at 350* for 30  Min. Just spread mix in pan and cook uncovered. Use a pancake turner to cut  and remove cooked burger.*** Mash beans. Add all ingredients and mix  well. (If you use all of the ingredients listed your mix may be a bit dry.  You might want to add a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of soy, nut, or rice milk. Of coarse  you also could use whole milk. Be sure you dont thin it too much or it  will be mushy. Look for a hamburger consistency.) Spoon about 2 heaping  Tablespoons of mix onto grill or frypan for each burger and flatten with  greased pancake turner. Turn several times rather than just once on each  side like conventional burgers, they have a better texture that way.
