submitted by: rayna@iconz.co.nz  Originally got this recipe out of a newpaper years ago and Ive had it so  long, the papers yellowed. Its a very good "Jello Mold"  Havent made it  in ages and I think Ill serve it as a salad at my dinner party on the  10th. Cheers from Rayna in New Zealand.    Empty gelatin into bowl, add boiling water and stir until gelatin is  dissolved.   Add ice cream and stir until melted.  Add orange juice,  undrained pineapple and walnuts. Turn into a mold. Chill. As mixture cools,  it separates.    Serve as salad or dessert.  Makes 6 - 8 servings.
