We  went to the Turkish Delight Cafe, here in Kingston, Ontario.  Meanwhile,  heres the Secret Recipe for Lentil Soup (secret no longer!).  Ive  eliminated the 2 tsp. olive oil to saute the onions - we certainly dont  need it...    Put finely chopped onions in a pan with your favorite sauteing liquid and  stir for 4-5 minutes on medium heat. Add chopped carrots and 2 cups of hot  water and bring to a boil. Add chopped potatoes and another 2 cups of hot  water. Add the rice and lentils with 2 cups of hot water and stir steadily.  Add chopped tomato, salt and black pepper, and the remaining water. Cover  and cook over low heat for approximately 30 minutes until tender. Stir  occasionaly. Before removing from the heat, add mint.  Yield: 12 servings.

This makes a thick and very flavorful soup which would be a complete lunch  for me, along with a thick slice of whole grain bread and a fruit for  dessert. And its economical to boot!!!
