Watermelon Pickles
SOAK, Salt, Vinegar, Cloves, Sugar, Vinegar, Cinnamon sticks, Watermelon rind (this is a, SYRUP, 
Cut skin and all red meat from watermelon. Cut rind into small pieces,  usually about two inches long and 1 inch wide (or squares if you prefer).  Cover melon with water, to which 1 cup salt and 2 cups vinegar* has been  added. Let soak overnight (at least 12-15 hours). In the morning, drain,  rinse and then boil in fresh water until melon looks like plastic and can  be easily pierced with a broom straw (about 2 hours). Drain and cool. In  another large pot, boil vinegar and sugar for 10 minutes. Add spices tied  in bag. Simmer until syrupy, about two hours. Add melon and simmer for 1  hour. Fill jars and seal. Makes 12 pints.    *Variation: A friend to whom I gave this recipe, soaks the melon overnight  in two gallons of water to 1 cup lime juice (no salt). She sent me a jar,  and they were wonderful. If you have lots of melons, you might want to try  both versions and see which you like best.    Should you need extra juice, make it in same proportion, and cook for about  20 minutes, then add to your syrup. My mom usuall had this extra syrup to  the side so she could be assured of filling all the jars.
