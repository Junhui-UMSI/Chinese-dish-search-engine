Farrell of Naperville entered her chocolate covered  cherry cookie recipe: "Christmas and chocolate-covered cherries are forever  entwined in my mind and memories. Not the expensive department store kind,  mind you, with their dark bitter chocolate and runny syrup, but your basic  Brachs. Each Christmas found the coveted white box stretching my stocking,  two layers of cream-filled heaven with a cherry floating therein--and no  requirement to share them with anyone.      "Taste and calories have kept me away from the box of delights for many  years, even after the incredible discovery that Brachs actually sold these  morsels all year long. (How my parents managed to deceive me on this, Ill  never know.) That is, until my mother-in-law came to Chicago one autumn  with the ultimate cookie. A Christmas tradition in one bite. Nostalgia from  the oven. Capable of reducing this 36-year-old womans taste buds and  mentality to that of my 9-year-old daughter. A chocolate-covered cherry  cookie!" from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest  December 4, 1986  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000
