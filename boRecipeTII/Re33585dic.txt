Swedish Kardemummakrans
LEMON ICING-, Cardamom -- ground, Red or green candied, Active dry yeast, Egg, Cherries -- halved (opt.), Powdered sugar, Salt, Lemon extract, All purpose flour (approx.), Butter -- melted and cooled, Sugar, Warm water, milk, Warm milk, 
In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water and let stand for about 5  minutes to soften.  Stir in milk, butter, egg, salt, sugar, and cardamom  until blended. With spoon, stir in 7 cups of the flour or enough to form a  stiff dough. Knead about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic, adding more  flour as needed to prevent sticking. Place dough in greased bowl, grease  top, cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled (1-1/2 to 2  hours). Punch dough down and knead briefly on floured board to release air.  Divide into 6 equal portions; pull each into a rope about 24 inches long.  Place 3 ropes on a greased baking sheet, pinch tops together, and braid  loosely. Form braid into a ring, pinching ends together. Repeat to make a  second braided wreath. Cover and let rise until almost doubled (about 40  minutes). Bake in a 350 oven until loaves are medium brown (35 to 40  minutes). Transfer loaves to a rack and let cool for 10 minutes, then serve  warm. Or, if made ahead, let cool completely, then wrap airtight and  freeze. Thaw unwrapped. To reheat, wrap in foil and heat in a 350 degree  oven for about 20 minutes. To serve, spoon half the Lemon Icing around top  of each wreath, letting it drizzle down sides. Decorate with cherries, if  desired.
