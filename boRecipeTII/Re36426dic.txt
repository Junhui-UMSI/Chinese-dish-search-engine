Inject Crispy Critters Basting Sauce into breast, legs and thighs.    Pop the top off the beer and punch 6 or 7 holes with a churchkey.  Spoon  the remaining dry rub into the beer. Insert the beer can into the bottom  cavity. Set the chicken upright on the beer can bottom. Spread the legs of  the chicken to form a tripod, so the bird stands upright. Smoke the bird  for 3 hours or until well done and ready to fall from the bone.
