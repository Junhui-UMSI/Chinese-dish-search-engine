Finely shredded chile del, Eggs; lightly beaten (or, Salt, (6-oz) El Pato sauce, Mozzarella cheese; shredded, -(up to), Cumin seeds; shredded in, Sharp Cheddar cheese;, Azumaya (sp?) firm tofu;, Cloves garlic; peeled and, 
1. In a large bowl, combine the well drained tofu and the cheeses.  Mix  thoroughly.    2. Combine the eggs, El Pato, garlic, chile, salt and cumin if used.  Mix  well and let stand 30 minutes to blend flavors. Add this mixture to the  cheese/tofu combo and mix _thoroughly_.    3. Turn the combined mixture into an ungreased, standard meatloaf baking  dish. Microwave on high 24 minutes, rotating the dish halfway through.  (Note: this is for a medium microwave oven - I dont have a time and  temperature setting for a conventional oven, but Im sure some cooking  sharpie out there could convert it for us).    4. Remove and cover with aluminum foil.  Let stand 30 minutes before  serving. This loaf is so versatile it goes well at breakfast, lunch and  dinner!  I personally refrigerate it and use it for breakfast - a 1 1/4"  thick slice needs about 3 1/2 minutes in the microwave to re-heat. Goes  great with Bufalo jalapeno, Tapatio or any good sauce or salsa. Note: This  recipe is for terminal chile-heads - its both very fiery and very  garlicky.  If you dont like things really hot, reduce the shredded chiles  or use a very mild chile and increase heat with subsequent loaves. Also,  Mario makes a good suggestion in using 1/2 El Pato and 1/2 regular tomato  sauce to reduce heat. (For me, thats an unspeakable desecration!)
