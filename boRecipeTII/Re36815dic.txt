Italian Granites or Ices are good and might work for you...    [Copied from The Best of Italian Cooking by Nika Hazelton (1989)] Water  Ices (Granite)    Most refresing on a hot day, granite are made with water and flavorings  only. They are admirably suited to being made in the refrigerator, since  they do not have to be stirred as often as cream ices to avoid the  formation of ice crystals. These crystals are part of a grainta, wich is  frozen the same way as ice cubes. The freezing time, though, will be  longer, because of the sugar in the granita.    Strain berries through a fien sieve or puree in a blender. Boil sugar and  water together for 5 minutes. Cool. Combine with berry puree and stir in  lemon juice. Freeze, stirring occasionally.
