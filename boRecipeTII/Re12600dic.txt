Yogurt Cheese with Pita and Olives
Ground cumin, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Toasted Pita Bread, Salt, Whole Milk Yogurt, Dried Summer Savory, Cayenne pepper, Sesame seeds, Triangles, Assorted Olives, 
Set strainer over large bowl.  Line strainer with 4 layers of cheesecloth,  allowing 4 inches to extend over sides of strainer (do not let strainer  touch bottom of bowl).  Hint:  If you dont have cheesecloth on hand, use  large coffee filter liners, e.g. Mr. Coffee filters. Spoon yogurt into  strainer.  If you are using cheesecloth, gather cheesecloth together; fold  over yogurt.  Refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Liquid will drain  out and yogurt will thicken. Since I use coffee filters most of the time, I  jus t invert a large plate on top of the strainer and refrigerate. Combine  sesame seeds, salt, summer savory, cayenne and cumin in small bowl. Open  cheesecloth up (or remove plate). Using a rubber spatual, transfer drained  yogurt to a bowl.  Drizzle olive oil over.  Sprinkle with sesame seed  mixture.  Place bowl in center of platter; surround with pita bread  triangles and olives.
