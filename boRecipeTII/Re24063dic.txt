Try serving the filling hot with potatoes or  toast, or with a breadcrumb topping, or serve in a home made tortilla.    Stir-cook ground meat and onion until meat is no longer pink. (Regular  ground meat is much less expensive than lean.) Drain fat and return  meat to the pan, add spices and stock.  This will take about 15  minutes.    Stir in mashed beans and simmer until liquid is just evaporated, about  another 15 minutes.  Cool filling about 30 minutes if making pie  crust. Serve hot immediately, refrigerate cooled mixture up to 3  days, or freeze cooled portions up to 3 months.    1/8 recipe - 292 calories, 1 1/2 starch, 2 protein, 1 fat choice 12  grams total fat, 3 grams saturated fat, 18 mg cholesterol, 16 grams  protein, 28 grams carbohydrate, 454 mg sodium, 517 mg potassium, high  fibre    Adapted from Full of Beans by Violet Currie & Kay Spicer 1993 Shared  but not tested by Elizabeth Rodier Jan 94    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/diabetic.zip
