TO PREPARE:  Pour polenta on an oiled work surface and spread 1/4" thick.  Let stand until cooled completely and firm, about 15 min. Cut into 3"  squares; set aside.

Strain liquid through a fine sieve; reserve. Chop mushrooms  coarse.    TO COOK: Heat oil and butter in a large skillet. Add onions, parsley,  carrots, and celery; saute until softened, about 10 min. Add ground meat;  saute until lightly browned, about 8 min. Stir in mushrooms, reserved  mushroom soaking liquid, tomato paste, and wine; simmer for 5 min. Add  tomatoes and their reserved juice; partially cover and simmer until sauce  thickens slightly, about 30 min.  Season this sauce with 1t salt and 1/2 t  pepper or to taste.  (Can cool, cover, and refrigerate overnight.)    Heat oven to 450F.  Arrange half of the polenta squares in the bottom of  an oiled 13x9" baking pan. Pour half the sauce over the polenta squares;  spread to cover. Sprinkle half the grated cheese over the sauce. Repeat  with another layer of each.  Bake until lasagne is heated through and  cheese is golden brown, 15 - 20 min; let stand 10 min, cut into squares and  serve. From Cooks magazine, Nov 89.
