Almond Crisp Cookies
Butter, Egg whites, All purpose flour, almonds *, Granualted sugar, 
* (the skins on look prettier, but skinned will do) Preheat oven to 300  degrees. Cream together butter and sugar. Add egg whites; beat till smooth.  Stir in flour. SPREAD PAPER THIN (I use a dough scraper) and right to the  edges of two well greased cookie pans. Sprinkle the almonds on top. Bake  for 25 minutes, watching very closely. The almonds should be pale brown.  Remove from oven and either cut into squares immediately or let cool and  bread into pieces.
