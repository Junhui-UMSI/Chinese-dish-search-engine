Roast until well browned, stirring  occasionally, for about 30 minutes. Add remaining stock ingredients except  the wine and continue to roast for 10 more minutes. Transfer solids to a  stockpot, discarding any fat.    Place the roasting pan over high heat and add wine. Scrape away all browned  bits and boil, stirring, until wine is nearly evaporated.  Add 1 cup of  water, and add this liquid to the stockpot. Add cold water to cover, bring  slowly to a boil, and skim well. Lower heat, and simmer uncovered, 3 to 4  hours.    Strain, pressing down on solids to extract all of the liquid; discard  solids. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate.  When chilled, lift off  any solidified fat from the surface and discard.
