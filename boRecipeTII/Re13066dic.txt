Hi! We tried this stew from the Press-Telegrams "Rookie Cookie" section  for kids and found it quite tasty. We changed it a little, but the name is  theirs:    Heat broth over medium heat in large pot until boiling. Add diced potatoes,  bring back to boil, and cook 5 minutes.    Add remaining ingredients except for mashed potatoes. Bring to low boil,  cover and cook 20 minutes.    Stir in mashed potatoes until well-mixed. Serves 4.    The original recipe called for 1 potato, 1/4 onion, 15-1/4 oz. can drained  tomatoes, 15-1/4 oz. can drained corn, 15-1/4 oz. can drained lima beans  and 1/2 tsp. pepper. We found that was pretty peppery, but tasty.    Posted to fatfree digest V98 #009 by Sherron <sherron@net-quest.com> on Jan  9, 1998
