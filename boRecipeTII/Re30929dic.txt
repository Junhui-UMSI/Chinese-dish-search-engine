Tante Christas Beef Tenderloin
Mustard, Parsley, Olive oil, Ground pepper, Salt, Beef tenderloin, Basil, Thyme, Celery leaves, Honey, Garlic, Marjoram, 
Combine all of the ingredients except honey and the meat. Spread the honey  on the meat and then spread everything else on. Spray the baking pan or  rack, and bake at 500 degrees (yes, 500 degrees) for 30-35 minutes. For  thinner cuts of meat, decrease time. (Use a meat thermometer if you are  wishy washy)    We used a thin cut when we got this recipe and left out the olive oil, but  I think that if you where using a thick cut of beef you might need to put  it back in.
