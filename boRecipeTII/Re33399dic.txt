Basic White Sauce with Milk (Bechamel)
Flour, White pepper, Instant nonfat dry milk, Freshly grated nutmeg, Nonfat milk, Piece of onion (about 1, TAB), Cornstarch or arrowroot, Grated carrot, 
In a small saucepan combine milk, onion, carrot, nutmeg and pepper. Bring  to a boil, then cover, remove from heat and allow to steep for ten minutes.  Pour the warm milk through a strainer, pressing down on the vegetables to  obtain all the juices. Let cool. Combine dry milk, cornstarch or arrowroot  and flour. Add one or two TAB cooled milk to the dry mixture and stir to a  smooth paste. Return the milk to the saucepan, add the flour paste and stir  over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens. If sauce will not be  used immediately, cover and refrigerate. Cold sauce will thicken; thin with  a little flavored cooking juice, wine or stock. Makes about 1 cup; recipe  is easily doubled.    VVegetables steeped in hot milk add flavor to this versatile sauce, which  can replace the butter-flour-milk white sauce in any of your recipes. It  also forms the base of a salt-free cheese sauce that in its turn can dress  vegetables, open-fac sandwiches, macaroni or baked potatoes.
