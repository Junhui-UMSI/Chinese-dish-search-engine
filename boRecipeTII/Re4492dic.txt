submitted by: bohemia@felix.TECLink.Net  When I posted the recipe for Pollo San Francesco a while ago, several  people asked me what pesto sauce was. For those of you that cant find it  at the local grocers, or would prefer to make your own, heres a recipe:    (makes about 2 cups)    Place the basil in a food blender.  Add the oil, garlic, parsley, salt,  pepper, and nuts.  Blend until all are chopped very fine but not smooth.  Remove from the blender and stir in the grated cheese.    Use in soups and on pasta.  Keeps for several days in the refrigerator.    from The Frugal Gourmet Cooks Three Ancient Cuisines: China, Greece, Rome    Aimee Lee, Jackson, Mississippi USA    DAVE <DAVIDG@CLAM.RUTGERS.EDU>    RECIPEINTERNET LIST SERVER    RECIPE ARCHIVE - 13 MAY 1996    From the RECIPEinternet: Recipes from Around the World recipe list.
