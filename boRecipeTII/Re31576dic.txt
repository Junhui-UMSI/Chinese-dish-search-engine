In medium bowl, combine cookie crumbs and margarine. Using back of spoon,  evenly press 2 rounded tablespoons crumb mixture onto bottom and sides of  each of 12 paper-lined 2 l/2-inch muffin-pan cups; refrigerate while making  filling. Set aside 12 small whole strawberries for garnish. Wash and slice  remaining strawberries; set aside 1 cup for glaze. Pat remaining  strawberries dry; divide among tart shells.

Blend remaining 1/4 cup water, sugar, cornstarch  and lemon juice; stir into berries. Heat to a boil; boil 1 minute until  thickened and clear. Cool.
