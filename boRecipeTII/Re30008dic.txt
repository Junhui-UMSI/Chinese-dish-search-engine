In a medium bowl place the cinnamon and walnuts, and mix them together.  Brush the bottom of a 14" x 20" baking dish with the butter.  Place one  pastry sheet in the dish and brush it with the butter.  Repeat this process  so that 6 pastry sheets line the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle 1/3 of the  nut mixture over the top of the pastry sheets.  Repeat this process so that  there are 3 layers of the nut mixture and 4 layers of 6 buttered pastry  sheets, ending with 6 pastry sheets. Cut the baklava into 40 diamond shaped  pieces.  Insert a whole clove in the top of each piece. Preheat the oven to  350 F.  Bake the baklava for 40 minutes, or until it is golden brown. In a  medium saucepan place the sugar, water, orange peel, lemon peel, and  cinnamon stick.  Bring the ingredients to a boil and then simmer them for 5  minutes. Add the honey and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove the pan from  the heat and add the lemon juice. Stir the ingredients together and then  let the syrup cool. Remove the orange and lemon peels, and the cinnamon  stick. Spread the cool syrup over the hot baklava. Cover the dish with a  towel and let it sit for 1 hour before serving.
