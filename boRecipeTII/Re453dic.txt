Stir half the mixture slowly into egg yolks. Stir yolk mixture  into saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, 2 minutes longer.  Remove from heat. Add butter, lemon rind & juice. Cool slightly. Pour into  pastry shell. Heat oven to 350. Beat egg whites & cream of tartar until  foamy. Add 1/2 cup sugar gradually. Continue beating until meringue forms  stiff, glossy peaks. Swirl meringue onto filling with spoon or spatula. Be  sure meringue touches crust all the way around to prevent shrinkage. Bake  15-20 minutes until meringue is tipped golden brown.
