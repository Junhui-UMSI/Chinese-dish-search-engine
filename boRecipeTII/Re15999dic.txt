Heat oven to 350 degrees. Using a food processor fitted with the metal  blade, grind the almonds with the flour until fine; reserve. Cream the  butter and the 1/3 cup sugar in the processor until fluffy. Add the egg(s),  baking powder and almond-flour mix. Process with brief pulses until  crumbly.    In a bowl, mix the apples, raisins, pine nuts, jam and the cookies, broken  up if needed.    Spray a 10-inch springform pan with cooking spray and cover the bottom and  sides with two-thrids of the crumb mixture, patting it firmly and evenly.  Fill the shell with the apple mixture and sprinkle on the remaining crumbly  dough.    Bake until set and the crust is golden, about 1 hour. If the crumble starts  to brown too much, cover with aluminum foil.    To serve, remove the pan sides and slide tart onto a platter.    Whip cream; when it starts to thicken, slowly add the 1/4 cup sugar, the  cinnamon and vanilla. Whip until soft peaks begin to form. Cover and  refrigerate for no longer than 1 hour.    Serve tart warm or at room temperature, with chilled cream on top.
