From: jewish-food    Date: Wednesday, June 26, 1996 10:35AM  I feel it is my personal responsibility to let everyone in the world know  about my 10-minute lasagna.  It requires no boiling of noodles  and you can  cook it in a fleishig oven because the pan is tightly sealed  ( at least  according to my understanding).    In an aluminum lasagna tin, layer as follows:          2    layers of lasagna noodles      sauce      cottage cheese      sauce          1    layer of lasagna noodles      American cheese      sauce      rest of lasagna noodles      sauce    Pour 2 cups of water over the whole thing.  Courage! It will look terrible.  Put a sheet of tin foil over it and tightly seal it.  Bake in a 425 degree  oven for about 1 hour.  Let it rest before cutting it so it will not fall  apart.    Thats it.  You may make any additions you wish.  I have added vegetables  and different seasonings according to my mood and what I find in the  pantry, but it is very acceptable to children plain.
