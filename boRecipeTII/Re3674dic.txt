From Modern Priscilla Cook Book  (Year and author unknown)    This cookbook was given to Margie by her grandmother, She (her grandmother)  received it from her mother when she was married. We dont know when or  where Margies g-grandmother got it. It is so old and worn that the pages  are starting to flake, and the front cover cannot be read so we dont know  who wrote this one. There is also no dates or cover pages in the book.  Pastry in next recipe-Gary
