Push out pears, add rest of the stuff and blend  till mushy. Pour into tupperware and re-freeze, all most completely, then  blend again. Eat or re-freeze for later. ENJOY!    Ive made sorbet with pears, peaches, frozen strawberries (add apple juice)  and pineapple.  Different combinations, oh yes and with fresh  cantelope/orange.
