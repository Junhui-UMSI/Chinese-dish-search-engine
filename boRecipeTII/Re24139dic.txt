Prepare Dashi: Combine water and kombu, bring to a boil. Turn off heat.  Add bonito flakes, stir and cover. Let sit for 5-10 minutes, strain soup  broth and discard bonito and kombu. Add onion and carrots to broth,  simmer 5 minutes. Add wakame flakes and greens, simmer 1-2 minutes and  then turn off heat.   Dilute Miso in 1/2 cup soup broth, add to soup. Add  tofu. Garnish with scallions and serve.     Combinations for miso soup are endless. Just remember, for best results  use three vegetables in small amounts and only cook them slightly. Pay  attention to colors as well as complementary flavors.      NOTE: When using EDEN Misos in any recipe, do not boil after Miso has  been added. The beneficial enzymes are destroyed by heating.
