White Bread 3
Sugar, Salt, Flour, Oil; optional, Water, Scoop yeast; (coffee scoop), 
Put about 3 cups of flour in the bowl of the Cuisinart, add about 2 T of  sugar, 1 1/2 t. of salt, and (over the sugar, not the salt) sprinkle about  1 small coffee scoop of yeast (probably about 2 T). If you use no oil or  want a fat-free loaf, close the Cuisinart lid at this point. If youd like  a loaf that will last a little longer, add about a T of oil. Then close the  lid and have about 1 1/2 cups of water handy in a measuring cup or a vessel  with a good thin pouring spout. Start the Cuisinart and slowly add in the  water in a thin stream until the dough forms a ball and starts to slam  around the bowl. If it is too thin, the dough will work up under the shaft  (I always use the steel blade and NOT the plastic one), so watch what is  going on inside. Also, do not use warm water, since working the bread in  the machine will warm up the whole dough and you can kill the yeast if it  gets too hot. If you start getting the dough too wet, stop and add another  T or two of flour and then start the machine again.    Anyway, after you have a rather soft, but not sticky dough running around  the machine, let the machine run for about 30 or 40 seconds. Feel of the  bowl with your hand to be sure that it is not too hot in there. Then just  turn off the machine and wait until the dough rises up to the top of the  bowl. Turn out and form into a loaf and put in a greased loaf pan or finish  a little more with your hand kneading and then put into any shape you want  (even bagels or baguettes). Bake and enjoy. About 400 degrees until golden  brown. I always cool on a rack so that it doesnt sweat.  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
