Rosh Hashana is just around the corner...This recipe is from a kindergarten  teacher at Jewish Peoples & Peretz Schools, where my kids go.I`ve been  making this cake since my older daughter was in Tzippora`s class 12 years  ago. I like to add an orange-honey sauce to make a pretty presentation...    Preheat oven to 350`. Mix eggs & honey. Add sugar & mix well. Add oil & mix  well. Dissolve baking soda in coffee & add to mix. Add baking powder &  flour & mix well. Pour into greased (or sprayed) tube pan. Bake at 350` for       55    minutes.    ORANGE-HONEY SAUCE: Blend OJ & honey. Add diced orange. Serve over honey  cake.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "leah perez" <perezleah@hotmail.com> on Aug  02, 1998,
