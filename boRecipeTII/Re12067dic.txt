Ziti Baked My Way
Grated Parmesan cheese, Italian Homemade Sauce, Ziti or Mostaccioli, OR, (32 oz) Jars Spaghetti Sauce, INGREDIENTS, Ricotta (low-fat), 
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE AND DO THE NIGHT BEFORE         Cook the ziti or mostaccioli pasta until al dente. Drain.    In a large roasting dish, spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom.  Sprinkle with 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese. Soften the ricotta cheese in  Microwave by cooking on LOW (30%) for about 1-1/2 to 2 minutes.    Layer with half each of ziti, ricotta cheese, sauce, and half of remaining  Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers. Bake in a preheated 350F. degree oven for  approximately 1 hour.  Let stand for 1/2 hour before serving. NOTE: If  making the night before, cover with plastic wrap.    DO NOT COVER WITH FOIL if dish is to be stored as the tomato mixture reacts  against the foil.    NOTE:  Remove plastic wrap and cover with foil before baking.    Deidre Anne Penrod, Prodigy Food & Wine Board
