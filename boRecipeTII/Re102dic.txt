Shortening, Baking chocolate, Flour, Sugar, Vanilla, Baking Powder, Salt, Beaten eggs, Powdered sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350 F.  Melt chocolate and shortening in a pot on the  stove. Mix well. Let cool. While it cools, mix together remaining  ingedients. Add eggs last, then fold in chocolate mixture and blend  thoroughly.  Pour into a 9x9" greased and floured baking pan. Bake for  approx 30-40 minutes.  Use the toothpick test. a little underdone in the  center is actually pretty good, but hey, thats me.. Sprinkle generously  with powdered sugar while still warm. Cut into 8 pieces. Eat while warm,  with a big glass of milk. Mmm. Not recommended as a substitute for meals,  but twill serve. :)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
