Baked Brie in Phyllo Dough with Black Sesame Seeds
Brie cheese, olive oil, Phyllo dough frozen sheets, Black sesame seeds, 
Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Romantic Dinners: Romantic Dinners allows you and your partner (if you  bring one) to learn what makes an evening romantic and how to prepare a  delicious and easy meal together. You are not obligated to bring a partner  so dont worry. With our appetizer and salad course, we were served  champagne. With dinner, a wonderful white wine was selected. Dessert...  youll see. Preheat oven to 350 degree F.    Cut Brie half into four triangles. Stick together two pieces to form a  rectangle.    Brush olive oil on phyllo sheets. Place the Brie on the phyllo and roll up,  tucking ends.    Brush olive oil on all exposed surfaces of phyllo.    Place on parchment paper and cook for 5-10 minutes or until golden brown.
