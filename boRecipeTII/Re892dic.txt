Honeydew Sorbet
Honeydew melon; diced, melon, Sugar, Lime zest; grated, Lime juice, 
Makes 1 quart.    Mash the sugar and lime peel with a spoon to release the oils. Let stand  for 5-10 minutes. Add the lime juice. Pour mixture through a fine strainer  into a blender or food processor; discard lime peel.    Add melon, a portion at a time, and whirl until smooth. Add more sugar or  lim juice if desired. Transfer to bowl.    Nest bowl in ice water; stir often until cold, 5-10minutes.    Pour chilled puree into an ice cream maker. Freeze as directed by the maker  until the sorbet is firm enough to scoop.    Serve or place in freezer until frozen harder.

To serve, thaw partially,  break into chunks, and beat to a slush with a mixer.    To freeze sorbets without an ice cream maker:    Pour the cooled sorbet mixture into a stainless steel bowl, and place in  the freezer. Let freeze until you have a 2-inch border of ice around the  edge of the bowl --- typically this takes 1 1/2 hours or so --- then remove  and scrape the frozen parts into the liquid middle, beating well with a  whisk (or even an electric beater, if you want a very smooth texture).  Repeat, freezing this time around for about 30 to 50 minutes. Repeat 1 or 2  times more, or until it is of a consistency where you can scoop it loosely  into a ball or oval.
