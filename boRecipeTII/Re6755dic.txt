This recipe was taken from one that was originally called "7 Day Polish  Slaw" with very few instructions. I found out that the longer it sits, the  better it gets. It is "sort of sweet and tart at the same time" like you  requested.    The following recipe is from "To Your Health!" cookbook. Please visit our  web page at: www.js-net.com/tmg    Mix the prepared vegetables together and sprinkle with the salt. Cover with  4 to 6 cups of water and set aside. Drain after 1 hour.    In a saucepan, mix together vinegar, water, and sugar, and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.    Pour the cooled dressing over the drained vegetables. Mix well and store,  covered tightly, in refrigerator at least 24 hours and up to a week before  serving. The longer this slaw sits, the better it is.    NOTE: This recipe contains no fat.
