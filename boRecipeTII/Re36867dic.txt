Beat egg whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat until stiff.  Beat in 3/4 cup powdered sugar gradually. Blend in the beaten egg yolks,  flour and vanilla. Grease a jelly-roll pan. Pour in the batter and bake in  a preheated 325-degree oven for 20 minutes or until cake is done. Turn cake  out onto kitchen towel that has been sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Carefully roll up the cake inside the towel and let cool. Unroll; arrange  fresh or thawed strawberries over cake. Spread with the one cup of whipped,  sweetened cream. Roll up again and chill.
