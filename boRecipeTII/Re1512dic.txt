Here is a great brine recipe that I pilfered off of Scott. Never did a  Turkey with it but the chickens turn out great..never salty. Be sure you  got the brine cold before you put the Turkey in it. Have read that warm  brine will make the meat too salty. Also believe I read where Dan Gill said  that the equal amount of sugar or other sweetner counteracts the salt.    Mix all in large container. Trim and prep chicken as desired (I like to  split the birds in half. They lay on the cooking surface better and are  easier to handle). Immerse in brine and soak for 4 - 24 hours. Remove from    brine, rinse briefly, rub (if desired), and cook until internal breast temp  hits 165 - 170. I like to remove them, place them in a disposable aluminum  pan (covered) and let them "rest" for appx 15 minutes. The only trouble  with this is the skin gets somewhat "leathery" using this method, and you  need to slap them on a grill (direct heat) for a few minutes to crisp the  skin back up. You can, if you desire, apply a thin coating of barbecue  sauce during the crisping phase.    You may want to baste the birds while cooking. I used the soaking marinade  once (after boiling thoroughly) but didnt care for the taste. I now use  this:    I baste them once or twice during the process, then finish them off with a  honey/butter glaze (instead of barbecue sauce). Mix 3 parts  butter/margarine with 1 part honey and coat birds thoroughly during the  last few moments of the crisping phase.
