Breadsticks
Breadstick dough, Garlic salt, Dried basil, 
Preheat oven according to package directions. Unroll dough on bread board.  Cut in half across to make 16 pieces. (I found the ?perforations?  inadequate, so I cut dough lengthwise where indicated.) Sprinkle each piece  lightly with garlic salt and sweet basil Press dough so herb will adhere.  Twist each piece and place on ungreased baking sheet, pressing the ends  down hard so they will stick. Bake according to package directions.    Recipe by Mangia!
