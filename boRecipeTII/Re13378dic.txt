Yankee Doddle
Jar (18-oz) Spaghetti sauce, American cheese, Macaroni, Onion, Ground beef, 
These recipes that follow are from a Lancaster, PA Amish cookbook. They are  very basic and I think I would doctor them up, myself - they lend  themselves to experimentation. Add or subtract anything your family  prefers. All recipes contributed LANCASTER COUNTY AMISH COOKBOOK.    Cook macaroni according to package directions. Drain. Brown ground beef,  add chopped onion and saute until onion is tender. Drain off fat. Mix in  the remaining ingredients and macaroni. Heat through and the cheese is  melted. Serve.
