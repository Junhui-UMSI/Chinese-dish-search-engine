In response to the person requesting barley soup recipes: I saw this today  on the Ask Dr. Weil website at www.drweil.com.    It called for 2 tablespoons olive oil which I substituted with broth or  wine to saute the veggies in (or a slight nonstick oil spray ). I would  probably use a pretty flavorful veggie stock since the seasoning in this  recipe is minimal...    Barley has been cultivated since the Stone Age and has been fermented to  make beer since not long after that. Like other cereal grains -- wheat,  millet, oats, corn and rye -- barley is a great source of fiber and  carbohydrates, and can also be used to make cereal, bread and soup. Folk  medicine uses barley in barley water, made by simply soaking barley in  water, which is reputed to be a great tonic during convalescence. "Pearl"  barley is the name of the grain when its been polished, after the husk and  bran have been removed. Its the form most commonly used in soups. Grains  like barley keep well. Their bulk and comparative cheapness make them a  useful staple, especially at this soup-worthy time of the year, so be sure  to keep some in your cupboard.    In a saucepan, combine the barley and 3 cups of vegetable stock. Bring to a  boil over medium heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the liquid is  absorbed.    Meanwhile, heat the saute liquid in a large pot and add the onion, carrots,  celery, and mushrooms. Cover and sweat the vegetables for about 5 minutes,  until they begin to soften.    Add the remaining vegetable stock and simmer 30 minutes, covered.    Add the barley and simmer 5 minutes more. Add salt to taste and ladle into  bowls. Serve garnished with some chopped fresh parsley.  Posted to fatfree digest V97 #285 by Kelly_Carney@amat.com on Dec 4, 1997
