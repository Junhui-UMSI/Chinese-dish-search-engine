Tomato sauce, Brown rice, Yellow onion, Tomato paste, Salt, Garlic, Red bell pepper, , epazote, olive oil, Chile powder, Vegetable stock, Ground cumin, 
In a heavy soup pot, saute onion, bell pepper, and garlic in olive oil over  medium heat for 5 minutes, or until soft. Stir in tomato paste, then add  remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and  simmer for 40 minutes, or until rice is light and tender.    NOTES : *You may either roast your own chiles and mince them, or substitute  canned diced green chiles.  Both work well. **You may substitute cilantro  for the epazote.
