In gratitude to everyone who came forward with Buffalo Balls, heres a  quickie hot wing thing I whipped up this weekend with what was around.    Squeeze the lime into the orange juice and mix in soy sauce. Add the hot  sauce (I used 2 teaspoons for non-chileheads; Id use a couple tablespoons,  at least, for myself). Put in the wings. Refrigerate for 4 hours to  overnite. Grill (best way) or bake at 400 for 15 minutes or so, until  theyre brown. Bake on a cookie sheet covered w/foil and sprayed w/nonstick  spray to make cleanup easier. These should be fairly lofat, if you care  about such things, with no oil in the marinade.
