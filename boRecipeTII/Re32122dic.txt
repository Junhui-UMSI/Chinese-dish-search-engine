Make a mixture of the margarine, parsley, tarragon and marjoram. Using a  dull knife, lift the skin from the breast meat of the halved chickens and  insert the blend of margarine and seasonings. Spread the blend under the  skin as widely as possible, making sure the skin is not so detached it will  come off when the chicken is turned on the grill. Make a marinade of the  oil, wine, soy sauce, crushed garlic clove and salt. Let chicken stand in  marinade overnight, or at least several hours. Turn chicken once during  this period.  Grill chicken halves over glowing coals on a greased rack.  Turn halves occasionally while basting with marinade until golden brown,  which should take about 1/2 hour. Yield: 6 servings.    WANDA C.
