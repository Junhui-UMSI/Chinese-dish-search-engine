Place frozen ducks in an uncovered roasting pan. Salt and pepper freely.  Roast in a 450 degree oven at least one hour until well browned on all  sides. (It is important that the ducks are not thawed first.)     Lower heat to 300 degrees.     Add water to pan to barely cover birds. Sprinkle celery and onions in  water. Cover pan and bake another 2-1/2 to 3 hours. By now the breasts  should be showing signs of falling off the bone or at least feel tender  when pierced with a fork. Ducks are done and ready to eat or be used as  follows:     WITH RICE: Add rice to broth around duck, cover and bake another 30  minutes.
