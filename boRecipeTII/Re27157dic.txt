Probably too long. Or, if  you have never been to a tea, then now is the time to have one of your very  own.    It doesnt require a special occasions to have one--but Mothers Day is  coming up, along with spring showers and warm afternoons. And what better  way to begin or end an afternoon than with a bit of relaxation, good  friends, a cup of hot tea and some wonderful things to nibble on?    You need not dress up for your tea party, but it sure is fun. I mean,  really. Where these days can a gal wear her white cotton gloves? I remember  being invited to my first grownup tea party a few years ago with "the  girls". We were all instructed to wear our tea party "fancy" outfits. My  friend and I just couldnt resist the invitation to finally get a chance to  wear the crinoline skirts we had gotten at a retro thrift shop. We were  quite the sight!    The party was such fun. Hot tea in fine china cups, pinkies stretched,we  sipped, nibbled and chatted. If youve never done this little ritual, you  really must try it. Its ohhhh soooo sophisticated, dahhhling, and quite  entertaining, too--just like you play-acted when you were little.    The tasty treats at a contemporary tea party need not be the usual  crustless cucumber sandwiches or plain scones with whipped cream. Nope,  today its a little something savory, a little something sweet, a little  something traditional with a twist, and a little something with cheese. And  lots of wonderful hot teas brewing.    Tiny little roasted potatoes topped with thinly sliced smoked salmon, a  dollop of chive red onion sour cream and a pouf of marinated tiny-diced  cucumbers give us the savory. Warm citrus scones are served with lots of  tangy rich lemon curd and country whipped cream along with spoonfuls of  fresh berries for a luscious sweet note to the menu. Thin French baquette  slices are spread with dill and edible flower-petal butter, then topped  with paper-thin slices of radish for a twist on the traditional tea  sandwich.    continued in part 2
