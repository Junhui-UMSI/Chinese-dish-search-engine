Barbecued Shrimp #4
Loads of black pepper, Plenty of garlic salt, Butter or margarine, Shrimp (1/2 lb per person), Liquid smoke per pound of, Liquid crab boil per pound, 
Wash and drain shrimp one hour before cooking; do not peel. Line pan with  shrimp 1-1/2 to 2 inches deep. On top of stove, bring to a boil butter and  spices. Pour sauce over shrimp and immediately put in a 400 degree oven and  cook 30 minutes. Stir often to keep shrimp covered with butter mixture.  Very good, but very rich.
