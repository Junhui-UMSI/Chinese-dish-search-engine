"Bread Machine Cookbook" Semolina Bread
Water, Salt, Yeast, olive oil, Sugar, 1 POUND LOAF, Semolina flour, 1 1/2 POUND LOAF, Water, Salt, Bread flour, Sugar, olive oil, Yeast, Semolina flour, Bread flour, 
Bake according to manufacturers instructions.    Authors notes:  "Semolina flour has a very high gluten content, and  therefore makes an exceptional loaf.  Expect a yellow-tinted interior and a  well-developed wheat flavor."    My notes:  I made this bread 6/3/96.  I used durum wheat flour instead of  semolina.  Barney unplugged my machine, so I had to finish the second rise,  and bake it in the real oven.  It turned out great. This bread is not  sweet, it has almost a "sour" taste. Holds up nice for sandwiches. Ill  make it again.    Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 14:49:42 -0400    From: Sleopo@aol.com    MM-Recipes Digest V3 #166    From the MealMaster recipe list.
