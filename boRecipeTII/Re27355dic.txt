(ROASTED CALABAZA AND APPLE BISQUE WITH RUM AND TOASTED ALMONDS). Preheat  the oven to 350~. Spread the garlic and calabaza in a roasting pan, drizzle  with butter if using, and 1 cup of the stock. Roast for 20 minutes. Add the  apples to the pan, stirring to coat, and roast for 30 to 40 minutes more,  until vegetables are very tender. Set aside. Heat the oil in a large, heavy  skillet over medium heat. Saute the onion until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir  in the nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice, and cook 2 minutes more. Add the  rum, increase heat to high, and boil until it is reduced by half and no  longer has a raw alcohol smell, about 2 minutes. Set aside to cool  slightly. Working in batches, puree the roasted apples, calabaza and garlic  and the sauteed onion mixture in a blender or food processor (a blender  works best), moistening as necessary with stock. Combine it in a large  saucepan with the remaining stock, and season to taste with salt and  pepper. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish each portion with 1 tb  of cream and a sprinkling of almonds. Source: Adapted from Chef Susan  Ferry. The Miami Herald. MM Waldine Van Geffen vghc42a@prodigy.com.
