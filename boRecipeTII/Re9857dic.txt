Im planning on taking it to my uncles house  tomorrow.  It smells pretty good.    I also made a banana variation for Neils parents, since his dad doesnt  like pumpkin.  Substitute 3 ripe bananas for the canned pumpkin and  cranberries, and substitute 1 ts nutmeg for the pumpkin pie spice. It, too,  smells pretty good.    * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJs BBS for Homemakers!
