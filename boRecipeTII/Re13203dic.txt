Barbeque Sauce: Combine ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a rolling  boil, reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 10 minutes or so.  Pour into sterilized canning jars, seal and let stand 2 to 6 weeks before  use. (If you are like me, not much chance of this happening, but it is a  nice touch to the recipe - CWS)    Dry Rub: Mix ingredients together thoroughly.    Preparation: Sprinkle dry rub liberally on ribs. Allow ribs to stand 20 to  30 minutes at room temperature until the rub appears wet. Prepare a smoker  for long, slow (230 degree) indirect cooking, using hickory chips or other  hardwood chips for extra flavor. Cook ribs, bone side down, for 2 hours at  230 degrees in a smoker using indirect heat. Turn and cook 2 more hours.  Turn and cook one more hour. During the last 15 minutes, baste with  barbeque sauce diluted by half with water. Serve ribs with warmed,  undiluted sauce on the side.
