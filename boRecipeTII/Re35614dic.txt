Stromboli Sandwiches
Water, Shredded Mozzarella cheese, Onion, Salt and pepper, Spaghetti sauce mix (dry), Ground beef, Hoagie rolls, 
Brown ground beef and onion; drain well.  Stir in sauce mix and water.  Simmer for 5 minutes.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Split hoagie rolls.  Lightly butter each half and sprinkle with garlic powder.  Place bun  bottoms on foil-lined cookie sheet.  Brown under broiler.  Spread 1/6  of ground beef mixture on each roll.  Top with cheese.  Broil until  cheese melts and starts to brown.  Brown bun tops and place on each  sandwich. I add extra seasonings to the ground beef to make it  spicier. Fol wrap each sandwich individually and serve. Randy Rigg  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #230    Date: Fri, 23 Aug 1996 22:59:56 -0500    From: pickell@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)
