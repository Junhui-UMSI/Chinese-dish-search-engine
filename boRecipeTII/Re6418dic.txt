Plum Jam Pork Chop Marinade
Rice vinegar, Plum jam, Brown sugar (optional), Dark sesame oil, Olive oil or peanut oil, Black pepper, Salt, 
Whisk all ingredients together well, adjust seasoning according to your  taste and the sweetness of the jam used, and marinate pork chops for about       30    minutes.    If grilling, turn frequently and baste often to prevent burning. Baste a  final time and serve.    If cooking on the stovetop, scrape marinade off and saute pork chops on  medium for 7 minutes per side. Remove from pan, keep chops warm and stir in  marinade, heating until it bubbles plus 2 minutes, then spoon over pork  chops and serve.    If baking, scrape marinade off of chops, brown them on both sides and cover  with marinade. Cover with foil or a lid and bake for 1/2 hour then turn the  chops, cover and bake for 15 minutes, uncover and bake 15 minutes. Serve.    NOTES : Dark, flavorful, Chinese-influenced pork marinade that becomes a=  sauce.
