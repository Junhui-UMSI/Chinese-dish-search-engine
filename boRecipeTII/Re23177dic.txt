Tuna Casserole
Bean sprouts, Onions, Water, Tuna, Mandarin oranges., Cream of mushroom soup, Chow mein noodles in the ca, Salted cashew nuts, 
Mix up the soup and water and add all the other ingredients, but save a few  of the noodles for garnishing the top. Put in a baking dish youve buttered  first.  Put the garnishing noodles on top and bake without a cover at 375  degrees for 20 or 30 minutes. My husband relaly likes this tuna casserole  better than any other.  I hope you enjoy it. Cindy
