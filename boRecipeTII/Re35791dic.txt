Soften cream cheese after it is at room temperature and pack into a pastry  bag with a large tip.  Stuff dates with cream cheese at the open end.  Walnuts may be inserted, if desired.  Roll stuffed dates in sugar and keep  refrigerated until ready to serve.    Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #95
