CUT EACH SAUSAGE INTO 4 PIECES. Place in a 3-quart pot, place over medium  heat on the stove and cook, 5 minutes. Pour off and discard fat and reserve  the sausages on a plate. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, 5  minutes, or until the onion softens. Halve tomatoes cross- wise, lay each  half cut side down and cut each half into 6ths. Add the tomatoes and tomato  paste to the pot and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add the hominy, oregano,  salt, pepper and hominy water. Cover, raise heat to high, and bring to a  boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer 20 minutes. When its time to get  dinner on the table, replace the sausages in the pot and cook 7 minutes.  Remove from the heat and add the parsley. Divide the ingredients between 4  soup bowls and garnish with lime slices. Serve warm tortillas instead of  bread.    MICHAEL ROBERTS - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
