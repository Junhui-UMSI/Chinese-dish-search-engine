Next day, transfer mixture to a large  soup pot. Add the leeks (reserving one) and the onion, and season to  taste. Bring slowly to a boil, cover, and then simmer for 2 hours, or  until the bird is tender. Skim off excess fat from the liquid. Remove  the chicken from the pot, skin, remove bones and cut meat into pieces  before returning to the pot (cut up the shin of beef, if necessary).  Add the prunes and remaining sliced leek and simmer gently for 10-15  minutes.
