Chichos (Dry Corn)
Fresh corn, 
Chichos may be substituted for fresh corn in soup, stews, etc.    Boil fresh sweet corn one half hour with the husks on, or roast in the oven  one hour. When dry, remove the husks and silk. Keep in a storage place. As  needed shell the corn from the cob, grind or crush. If the grain is used  whole, soak in cold water overnight.
