Source: Knudsens "Cooking for Complements"    1. Cook noodles according to package directions adding 1 tbsp butter or oil  to water; drain.    2. Brown beef, breaking into pieces; drain excess fat.    3. Cover bottom of baking dish with thin layer of sauce; add beef to  remaining sauce.    4. Beat eggs in medium bowl; blend in cottage cheese, green onion, parsley  and salt.    5. In baking dish, layer in order half the following: noodles, cottage  cheese mixture, Mozzarella slices and sauce. Repeat with remaining  ingredients. Top with Parmesan cheese. At this point, lasagne may be baked  or it may be covered and refrigerated for one or two days.    6. Bake at 350 degrees 30 to 35 minutes (slightly longer if refrigerated)  or until bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.    Spaghetti Sauce:    1. Saute garlic in olive oil.    2. Add remaining ingredients and simmer, uncovered, 1 1/2 hours, stirring  every 30 minutes.    Makes about 6 cups.    Note: My husband and I like a wet lasagne, so I double the amount of sauce  called for in the recipe; I also double the cottage cheese mixture and the  mozzarella cheese, and put it all in a 13x9x2-inch pan.
