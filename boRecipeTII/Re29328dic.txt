Saute the onions and garlic in oil.  Add the tomatoes, oregano, chili  powder, parsley, and coriander (or cilantro), if available. Simmer for 25  minutes.    Place the steak in an oiled baking dish.  Dot it with butter and season  with salt and pepper. Bake at 425-degrees acording to the Canadian theory  (cook fish EXACTLY 10 minutes per inch, measured at the thickest part of  the fish). Pour the sauce over the fish, top it with the green peppers, and  return it to the oven for 5 minutes to blend thoroughly. Serve with rice  and sauted eggplant.
