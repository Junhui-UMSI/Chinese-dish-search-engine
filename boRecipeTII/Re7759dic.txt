* 4 cups loosely packed    ** could substitue gorgonzola cheese    Heat 2 Tbs. of the oil in a large skillet until moderately hot. Add the  onion and cook until soft and lightly browned, about 15 min. Add the  garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and cook for another 5-7 min. Add the port  and cook until the liquid is reduced by about two-thirds, about another 10  min. Add the spinach and cook until its wilted. Set aside in a mixing  bowl; wipe the skillet clean.    Gently rub a spoon on the underside of the mushroom caps to scrape off the  gills. Heat the remaining 2 Tbs. of olive oil in the skillet until hot. Add  the mushrooms, gill side up, and cook over medium-high heat for 2 min. Flip  and cook for another 2 min. Flip the mushrooms again so the gill side is  up. Season with salt and pepper.    Top each mushroom with the onion mixture, pouring the juices over the  mushrooms. Add 1 Tbs. water to the pan and simmer, covered, until the  mushrooms are barely tender, about 5 min. Crumble the chees on top, cover,  and cook until the cheese has melted, about 2 min.

For a great main-course salad, toss  some spinach with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar, top with the  mushrooms, and pour the hot pan juices over the leaves to wilt them.
