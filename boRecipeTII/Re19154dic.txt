for such a great response!  Let me add a recipe from last years VEGETARIAN  TIMES (12/90). Place vegetables in a strainer and press out liquid.  Transfer to a bowl. Stir in flour and wheat germ. In another bowl, mix  together eggs, garlic and soy sauce; add to veggies (if mixture is watery,  add additional flour or matzoh meal). Heat enough oil to cover surface of a  large, heavy skillet. When hot, drop veggie mixture by soupspoonsful into  the pan. Cook over medium heat until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.  Turn and brown the other side. Serve hot with additional soy sauce to  taste.  Makes 8 pancakes, (4 servings of 2 pancakes each) Per serving: 240  cal.; 12g protein; 10g fat; 31g carb.; 107mg chol.; 182mg sodium.
