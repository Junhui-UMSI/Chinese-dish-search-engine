Traditional Christmas Pudding
Mixed peel, Nutmeg, Mixed spices, Nuts, Currants, Raisins, Salt, White breadcrumbs, Dark brown sugar, Fat, Zest and juice of 1 lemon, Eggs, Suet, Flour, milk, 
Mix dry ingredients and fruit in a large bowl. Mix in the lemon. Beat  the eggs and milk together and mix in. Mix all very well (this is  where the ritual of everybody having a go at mixing and wishing a  wish comes in, and adding the silver charms if you have them).    Pack the mixture into one or more greased bowls that will survive  being boiled. Tie plate or saucer on the top of each for a lid. Tie  each up in a cloth. Place in a large pan (best if bowl is also  sitting on a rack and not on the bottom of the pan), with cold water  that comes about 3/4 the way up the bowl, and lid on the pan. Bring  the water to the boil over medium heat, and keep boiling gently for 6  hours. Keep a watch that the water does not boil dry, and any water  you add MUST be boiling water so as not to interrupt the cooking  process. Fish out of the water and store in a cool larder (still in  the bowls). It will keep like this for several months, and the  tradition was that it had to be made before December 1. Before  serving, heat up again by placing in cold water, bringing to the boil  and keeping on the boil for another 2 hours. Turn out of the bowl  onto a plate, decorate with a sprig of holly and serve. Heating up  can also be done in the oven (if theres room in there with the  turkey), with the bowl sitting in a pan of water.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
