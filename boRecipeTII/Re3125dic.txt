Peanut Stuffed Jalapeno
Crunchy Peanut Butter, 
Posted by George Morgan:    Remove stem, cut pepper in half, lengthwise. Fill with peanut butter.    Comments Dont knock it until youve tried it. Find a hot brand of  Jalapenos, the peanut butter takes some of the heat away.    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Mar 06, 1998
