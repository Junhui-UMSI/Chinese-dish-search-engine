Cynthia mentioned the Tightwad Gazette, which brought to mind the following  recipe.    Mix the first six ingredients. Mix in soy flour/water mixture. Add milk and  mix well. Chill 1/2 hour. Make into patties and fry 10 minutes per side, or  bake on cookie sheet at 350 degrees, 10 minutes on each side.    Notes:    1. The lentil-bulgur mixture is simply equal parts lentils and bulgur  cooked together. I usually make a large amount and freeze in 2 cup  portions.    2. You can, of course, use any seasonings you like.    3. The author doesnt say how big to make the burgers -- I like them kind  of small and fairly thin and get about a dozen.
