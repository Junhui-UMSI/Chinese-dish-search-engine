Sweet/sour Meatball
Few slices lemon, Shortening, SAUCE, Hot water, Ginger Snaps crumbled;, Brown sugar, Pepper, Worcestershire Sauce, MEAT BALLS, Matzo meal; (or cracker, Flour, Salt to taste., Light raisins, Vinegar; (yes, vinegar), Egg, Smallish onion, Ground beef; (or turkey), 
Meatballs: Mix ingredients. Refrigerate for a few hours. Form into small  balls. Brown the balls WELL, using either margarine or a substitute. This  browning is especially important if you use turkey. May be made well in  advance, frozen or refrigerated.    Sauce: Brown flour in shortening, stir in the water gradually. It should be  lump free. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for at least a half hour,  stirring occasionally.    When done, drop meatballs into sauce.    NOTES: I usually adjust the ingredients to use 2 lbs. of ground meat and  double the sauce. It is outstanding on rice! Let me caution you, it tastes  better when chilled or frozen and re-heated. Additionally, some people find  the vinegar a bit strange smelling .. but have no fear it will be good.    Additionally, I adjust (to may taste) the lemon, ginger snaps after tasting  sauce ... and, have discovered that I prefer more pepper in the balls.
