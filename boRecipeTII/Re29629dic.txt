Tasty Green Beans with Soy Sauce Dressing
Sugar, Salt, Dried hot red chili, Soy sauce, garlic, Oriental sesame oil, Green beans, Peanut oil, 
This is from _Madhur Jaffreys Cookbook_, which Ive had about 10 years.  Dont know it its still in print, but it has some really delicious and  easy stuff in it. Made these green beans for dinner with some teriyaki  chicken breasts and plain rice.    Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Drop in the beans and cook  rapidly for 4 to 5 minutes or until just crisp-tender. Drain, and if not  serving very soon, rinse under cold water. Leave to drain in a colander.    Mix together the soy sauce, sugar and sesame oil. Set aside.    Put a wok or a large cast-iron frying pan to heat over a medium-high flame.  When hot, put in the peanut oil. It should heat up in seconds. Now put in  the garlic. Stir once or twice. Put in the red chili. Stir once and put in  the drained green beans. Stir them around until a few are lightly scorched.  Pour in the soy sauce mixture. Continue to stir and fry until most of the  sauce is absorbed. Turn the heat down and taste for salt; you might want to  add a little but more. (I didnt. Soy sauce is salty enough!) Stir to mix  and serve.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Kathy Rogers <kathyrogers@EARTHLINK.NET> on Sep  11, 1997
