Lemon Bars - Lowfat
Flour; sifted, Cornmeal, Salt, Baking soda, Unsalted butter; at room, Sugar; divided, Egg yolk, Nonfat yogurt, Vanilla, Eggs, Egg white, Lemon juice, Grated zest of 1 large lemon, Flour, Powdered sugar for dusting, 
Position rack in lower third of oven and Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray  pan lightly with vegetable oil spray.    Make the crust: Stir the 3/4 cup of flour, the corneal, salt and baking  soda together with a whisk to combine. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl,  beat the butter until creamy. Add 1/3 cup of the sugar and beat at high  speed for about one minute or until mixture loses its crumbly texture and  begins to form a mass. Beat in the egg yolk, yogurt, and vanilla. Add the  dry ingredients and beat on low speed just until combined. Scrape the bowl  and beater. Knead the mixture briefly with your hands to mix thoroughly.    Press the dough evenly into the pan and prick all over with a skewer or  fork. If pan is light weight, place on baking sheet. Bake until brown on  top, about 20 to 25 minutes.    Make the topping: Whisk eggs and the egg white with the remaining sugar  until combined. Whisk in the lemon juice and zest. Whisk in the 1/4 cup of  flour. When crust is brown, turn oven temperature down to 300 degrees. Pour  topping over hot crust and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until topping barely  jiggles in the center when you shake the pan gently back and forth. Cool on  a rack. Chill before cutting into squares.    Serve cold or at room temperature (I like them cold) dusted with powdered  sugar. They last a couple of days but are most delicious on the day they  are baked.
