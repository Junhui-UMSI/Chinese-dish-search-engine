Salt, unsalted butter, All-purpose flour, Baking Powder, Semisweet chocolate chips, Egg, milk, raspberries, 
In a small saucepan melt 2 tablespoons butter over moderately low heat,  stirring. Stir in milk and heat until just warm. Remove pan from heat. In a  bowl whisk together milk mixture and egg. Into another bowl sift together  flour, baking powder, and salt and stir in egg mixture until just combined.  Gently stir in raspberries and chocolate chips.    Preheat oven to 200? Heat a griddle over moderate heat until hot enough to  make a drop of water scatter over surface. Add 1 teaspoon butter and with a  metal spatula spread over griddle. Working in batches, drop 1/4-cup  measures of batter onto griddle to form pancakes about 4 inches in diameter  and cook until bubbles appear on surface and undersides are golden brown,  about 2 minutes. Flip pancakes with spatula and cook until undersides are  golden brown and pancakes are cooked through. Transfer pancakes as cooked  to an ovenproof platter and keep warm, uncovered, in oven. Make more  pancakes with remaining butter and batter in same manner.    Serve pancakes with syrup. Makes about 10 pancakes, serving 2 generously.  Accompaniment: pure maple syrup, heated    Recipe by: From Gourmet Magazine, July 1997 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1  #748 by C4 <c4@groupz.net> on Aug 19, 1997
