Pumpkin Coffee Cake
Cooked, mashed pumpkin, Chopped walnuts or pecans, Butter or margarine, Seedless raisins, Sugar, Milk, scalded, Unsifted flour (about), Salt, Vanilla, Active dry yeast, Sugar, Salt, Warm water (105-15 degrees, Egg yolk, beaten with 1, Cinnamon, Frosting:, Ginger, Filling:, Milk or light cream, Egg, lightly beaten, 
Dough:    Mix milk with sugar, salt, and butter, stirring until sugar disolves; cool  to lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir until disolved.    Combine milk and yeast mixtures add egg and half the flour, and beat until  smooth and elastic, adding only enough extra flour to keep dough from  sticking. Place dough in a greased bowl, turn to grease all sides, cover  with cloth, set in a warm, draft-free place, and let rise about 1 hour  until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, turn onto a lightly floured board,  and roll into a rectangle about 22"x10". Mix pumpkin with sugar, spieces,  and salt and spread evenly over dough, not quite to edges. Sprinkle with  1/2 cup walnuts and the raisins. Roll up jelly-roll fashion from the wide  side, lify to a greased baking sheet, and coil into a ring. Cover and let  rise in a warm place about 1 hour until doubled in bulk. Meanwhile, preheat  oven to 350 degrees F. Brush ring with egg glaze and bake 30-35 minutes  until well browned and hollow sounding when tapped. Mix frosting  ingredients together until smooth and frost ring while still warm; sprinkle  with remaining nuts. Serve warm or at room temperature.    About 400 calories per serving.
