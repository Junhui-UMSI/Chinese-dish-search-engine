Peas and Salt Pork
Yellow onion, pepper, frozen peas, Salt pork, 
It was Mr. Jefferson who really got us into peas. He was so fascinated by  this legume that at one point he experimented with some fifty varieties.  This must have been a typical way of cooking them since it is a method of  cooking many vegetables in Virginia. In any case, when you have peas be  sure and remember Mr. Jefferson. He would love to be at your table with  you!      The simplicity of this dish is what makes it so good. Salt pork was used  for richness, much the same way we would use butter now.      Dice the salt pork and blanch it for 1 minute in boiling water. Drain.  Heat a large frying pan and saute the salt pork just until clear. Add the  onion and cook until the onion is clear. Add the peas and stir all well.  Cover and cook until the peas are tender, about 8 minutes. Season with  pepper and serve.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
