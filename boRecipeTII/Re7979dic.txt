This is a refreshing soup to be served in bowls nestled in ice. Try it as a  first course or dessert.  It is especially good at a brunch.  This soup has  everything going for it except its color .... a subdued gold that doesnt  match its upbeat flavor.  A few drops of red food coloring will give it  life.    Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Clean and cut the rhubarb into 1-inch lengths.  Place the pieces in a heavy saucepan.  In a separate saucepan, heat the  sugar and water and stir to dissolve the sugar. Cook to a light syrup  without stirring, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.    Place the rhubarb and sliced bananas in the blender work bowl.  Puree the  mixture until smooth.  Mix in the orange juice and the rum, if using it. If  the soup needs color, blend in 8 to 10 drops of red food coloring.  Stir in  the apple.    Serve in chilled bowls, preferably glass, surrounded with crushed ice.  Float half of a very thin slice of lime on the top of each bowl.
