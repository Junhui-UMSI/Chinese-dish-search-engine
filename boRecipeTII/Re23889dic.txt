Asparagi Fritti Al Prosciutto
Salt, Butter, Slices prosciutto, Eggs; beaten together, Cooking oil, Fat asparagus spears, Flour, 
COOK ASPARAGUS IN BOILING salted water until barely tender, about 10  minutes. Drain in a colander, spray with cold water, and pat dry. Lay  asparagus out on a platter. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and drizzle it  over asparagus spears. Put beaten eggs on one plate and flour for dredging  on another. Heat remaining butter and oil in a skillet. Wrap each asparagus  spear in a slice of prosciutto. Roll them in flour (brush off excess), dip  in egg, and saute them until golden, about 2 minutes to a side. Drain on  paper towels and serve hot. NOTE: If there are no fat asparagus, use twice  as many skinny ones; cook a few minutes less and roll 2 spears in each  slice of prosciutto.
