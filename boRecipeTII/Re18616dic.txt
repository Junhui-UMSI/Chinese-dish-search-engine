Place  the spices in a cheesecloth bag and add them. Cover the pot and let steep  for however long you wish. (I like 15 minutes). Remove the spices, add  sliced citrus and serve with a non-metal ladle or dipper (if you dont take  out the spices, subsequent servings will have a stronger spice taste).
