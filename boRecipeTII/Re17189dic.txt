Vlf Hummus
Cooked chickpeas, Plain nonfat yogurt, garlic, Ground cumin, 
optional, depending on how strict you want to be about the vlf: 6 drops or  so of toasted sesame oil (doesnt add dramatically to the fat, but  *greatly* improves the flavor for us "real" hummus fans - makes up  partially for the lack of tahini)    Combine all ingredients in blender and blend smooth. Garnish with a dash of  paprika and serve w/pita triangles, in a sandwich, etc. My favorite is  hummus on a pita with carrots, cucumbers, and lettuce (that was lunch  today, in fact!)  Hummus is so easy to make that you can whip it up while  eating breakfast to take to work (like I did today) for all you people  looking for quick lunch ideas.
