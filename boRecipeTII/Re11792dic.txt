Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Toss the beets in olive oil with salt and  pepper. Roast in a small sheet pan for an hour or so or until tender all  the way through. Allow to cool and then peel.At the same time, toss the  garlic cloves with olive oil, salt and pepper. Wrap in a piece of foil, and  roast 40 minutes or until tender. Allow to cool. Meanwhile, heat 1  tablespoon olive oil in a small frying pan. Add the shallots and cook over  moderate heat until tender, about 4 minutes. Cool. Puree the beets in a  food processor. Add the ricotta and mix well. Transfer the beet mixture to  a bowl and add the shallots, basil and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt  and pepper. Heat the cream in a saucepan and reduce by one quarter. Puree  the roasted garlic with the reduced cream. Season with salt and pepper.  Strain if you like. Keep warm. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add  salt. Blanch the pasta sheets until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Cool  in ice water. Lay the pasta sheets on an oiled sheet pan. Put a spoonful of  beet filling in the center of each pasta sheet. Roll up the long way and  twist the ends to form a bundle. They should look like wrapped candies.  They can be made, covered with plastic and refrigerated overnight up to  this point. Increase the oven to 400 degrees. Set the bundles, side by  side, on an oiled sheet pan. Bake 5 minutes or until the edges just begin  to brown. Put a spoonful of sauce on each of 4 warm plates. Arrange 2  bundles on each plate. Sprinkle with poppy seeds and walnuts and garnish  with a sprig of basil.
