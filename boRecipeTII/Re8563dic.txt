Place ginger, coriander, cumin, tomato sauce & 3 tb water in a blender &  blend till smooth.    Break potatoes into bite sized pieces.    Heat oil (I use ghee) in a large pot. When hot, throw in fennel, fenugreek  & mustard seeds.  After 20 seconds, add red chilies. As they darken, put in  paste from blender.  Fry for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Put in the  potato pieces & fry for 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 c warm water. Bring to a  boil. Add salt & lemon juice. Simmer for 20 minutes.    Before serving, sprinkle with garam masala.
