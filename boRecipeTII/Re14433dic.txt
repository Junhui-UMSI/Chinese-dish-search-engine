I made this last night in my old R2D2 Welbuilt and it handled the dough  pretty well. I used egg substitute and a teaspoonful or so of gluten but  otherwise followed the recipe and measured accurately. The top was a bit  sunken but the crust was nice and brown and thick for the large size loaf.  I used the white bread setting and set the dial for the lightest crust.    >From: HS.Roch811sd@xerox.com (Heather)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Donna Germain s Bread Machine Cookbook
