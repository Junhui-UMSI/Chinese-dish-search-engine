Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 1:30    1 . In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process flour, cornmeal,  yeast, sugar, and salt just to blend.    2. With motor running, add water in a steady stream. Process until mixture  comes away from sides of work bowl. Process 30 seconds to knead dough. If  dough is sticky, add more flour and process 30 to 60 seconds longer. Dough  should feel tacky, smooth, elastic, and warm but not hot.    3. Remove dough from processor and shape into ball. Place ball in an oiled  bowl, turn to coat it with oil, and cover with plastic wrap or a damp  towel. Let dough rise until doubled in bulk, 30 to 60 minutes.    4. Punch dough down and divide it in half. Fit each piece into a 12-inch  pizza pan. Spread each with toppings of your choice.    Makes two 12-inch pizzas.    Notes - add fresh vegetables, bits of ham, grated cheese -- whatever sounds  good -- to make a gourmet pizza.
