Portuguese Style Chile Sauce
TASTE, Chopped cuentro (cilantro;, Alcohol (Aguardente;, Salt to taste, Fresh not-quite-ripe tomato;, Clove garlic (or more);, Crushed hot chiles, Other ingredients according, Onion, 
Oddly enough, I was chatting with a Portuguese acquaintance at a barbecue a  couple of days ago.  He described a sauce he makes using chiles and  alcohol, which is roughly as follows:    To make one jar: Fill the jar about half full with crushed hot chiles.  (He  uses piri-piri, a small thin red very hot chile.  I think its the same as  the Brazilian malagueta, for those who may know it.) Add sufficient alcohol  (aguardente, cachaca, grappa, vodka, etc) to cover the chiles and leave for  a week.    Add the other ingredients according to taste.  He uses something like: 1  fresh not-quite-ripe tomato, chopped, 1 onion, chopped, 1 clove of garlic  (or more), chopped, salt to taste, chopped cuentro (cilantro, coriander)  (optional).
