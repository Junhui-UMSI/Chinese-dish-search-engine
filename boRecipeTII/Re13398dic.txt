Place rice in a sauce pan with a tight fitting lid. Bring broth and water  to a boil, pour over rice, stir and cover. Cook over low heat for 15  minutes or until liquid is absorbed and rice is just tender. Uncover and  fluff with a fork. For a 10-12 pound turkey. While rice is cooking, heat  the olive oil in a kettle over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until it  gives off fragrance, but dont let it brown. Add the onions and cook,  stirring often, until they are melted and starting to turn gold. Add the  spinach and cook until just done, about 12 minutes for fresh, slightly less  for frozen. Remove the kettle from the heat and add the cooked rice,  oregano, Parmesan and a little salt and pepper (and the sausage if you are  using it). Taste and adjust seasonings, then stir in the eggs.
