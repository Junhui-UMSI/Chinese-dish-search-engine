A chef on TV (could have been on Bert Wolfes show) prepared this:    Ancho puree: Remove stem, seeds and veins from 4-5 ancho chiles. Cut in  pieces. Soak in boiling water 20 minutes.  Blend in blender with small  amount of fresh water.    Cream eggs and sugars.  Add flour and ancho paste.  Add melted margarine.  Mix well.  Add nuts, chocolate chips and vanilla.  Put in shell.  Bake at  350 d. about 1 hr. until lightly browned. Serve with Cool Whip.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #243    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
