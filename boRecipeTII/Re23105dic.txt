Tsimmes with Dumpling
Water, baking powder, Cornstarch, golden (corn) syrup, Potatoes, Flour, For the Dumpling, brisket, salt, Carrots, white pepper, Margarine, salt, 
Trim excess fat off the meat, leaving a thin edging, then cut into 1  1/2-inch (4 cm) chunks. Peel the carrots and cut into 1/2 inch (1.25  cm) cubes. Put the carrots and meat into a pan, barely cover with hot  water, add 2 tablespoons of the syrup, the pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of  salt, bring to the boil and simmer for 2 hours either on top of the  stove or in a slow oven. Skim, or if possible, chill overnight, so  that most of the fat can be removed.    4 hours before you want to serve the tsimmes, make the dumping by  rubbing the margarine into the flour and salt. Mix to a soft dough  with the water. Put the dumpling in the middle of a large oval  earthenware, enamel or enamelled-iron casserole. Lift the meat and  carrots from their cooking liquid with a perforated spoon and arrange  round it. (Without a dumpling, simply put the carrots and potatoes  into the casserole.) Mix the cornflour with enough water to make a  smooth cream, then stir into the stock from the carrots and meat.  Bring to the boil and pour over the carrots and meat. Peel and cut  the potatoes into large cubes and arrange on top, adding extra  boiling water if necessary so that they are just submerged. Sprinkle  with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and 2 tablespoons of  syrup. Cover and bring to the boil on top of the stove, then transfer  to a slow oven, Gas No. 2 (300 degrees F/150 degrees C), for 3 1/2  hours. Uncover and taste, adding a little more syrup if necessary.  Allow to brown for a further half an hour, then serve. The potatoes  and the dumpling should be slightly brown and the sauce slightly  thickened.
