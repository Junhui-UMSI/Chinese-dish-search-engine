1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheet(s) ready. Sift  together the flour, baking soda, spices and salt; set aside.      2. Beat the butter and 1 cup of the granulated sugar in large bowl of an  electric mixer on high speed until light, 1 minute. Add the egg and  molasses;  mix well. Stop the mixer and add the flour mixture. Mix just  until combined.      3. Using about 1 1/2 teaspoons dough for each, roll dough into balls.  Roll  in the remaining  1/2 cup granulated sugar so they are fully coated.  Arrange  on baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart. If you prefer a  thin, crisp  cookie, they may be flattened with a glass that has been  dipped in sugar.      4. Bake until set, 9 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
