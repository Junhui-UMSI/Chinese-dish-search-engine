milk, Eggs, Flour, Salt, 
Break eggs into bowl & beat until foamy. Add milk, flour & salt & beat  briskly 1/2 minute. Scrape down sides of bowl & beat 1-1/2 minutes. Pour  smooth batter into 6 cups of a popover pan or muffin pan, 2/3 full. Bake at  400 for 50 minutes or until puffed up & golden brown. Do not open oven door  until baking time is up. Serve hot. (These are tough after they get cold).    MARY BARNES    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
