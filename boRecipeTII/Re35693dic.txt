Stuffed Bell Peppers (Bharva Hari Mirch)
Cayenne pepper; optional, Coriander, Carrots; grated, Vegetable oil, Mustard seeds, Turmeric, Green bell peppers, Shredded cabbage, Salt, 
Wash and dry the bell peppers. Cut the bell peppers lengthwise (from the  stem side) in half. Remove the seeds and cut out the pulp part near the  stem, leaving the pepper in a cup-like form. Set aside. Heat 1/2 tsp. oil  in a large, nonstick fry pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds, covering  with a lid to avoid splattering. Fry for a few seconds until the mustard  seeds stop popping. Add the shredded cabbage and carrots. Stir. Add  turmeric, salt, coriander and cayenne pepper and stir. Cover with a lid,  heat through, reduce heat and simmer for 5-7 minutes. The vegetables should  be slightly tender. If there is any excess liquid accumulated at the bottom  of the pan, increase heat to evaporate it. Remove from the heat and cool to  room temperature. Divide cabbage mixture into eight equal parts. Stuff the  bell pepper halves with the mixture. Clean the fry pan and heat the  remaining 1-1/2 tsp. oil over medium heat. Place the stuffed bell peppers  in the hot oil with the stuffed side f! ! ! acing up. Reduce heat, cover  with a lid and simmer for 10-12 minutes until the bell peppers become  tender. The bottom of the bell peppers will be slightly black. Transfer the  bell peppers to a serving tray.
