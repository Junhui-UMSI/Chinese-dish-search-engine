In a large saucepan, combine beer, water, bay leaves, peppercorns and salt.  Bring to a boil; add fish, then cover and turn off heat. Allow to cool,  covered, about 15 minutes or until fish is opaque throughout. (Fish cooks  as liquid cools; this extra-gentle method of cooking keeps the fish flesh  intact.) Meanwhile, cook fresh corn in boiling water until tender; drain,  then cut kernels from cobs. Combine corn, tomatoes, bell pepper, poblano  chile, hot chiles and green onions; set aside. Then prepare dressing: whisk  together salsa or tomatillos, lime juice and oil. Taste and adjust heat; if  not hot enough (or if you used tomatillos), add jalapeno juice to taste.  Toss dressing with vegetables and place mixture in a large salad bowl.  Drain fish; gently flake and scatter around edge of bowl. Sprinkle with  cilantro, if desired. Makes 4 servings.    NOTE: If you have fresh tomatillos on hand, you may use them in place of  the canned variety. Remove the husks and stems, then steam fruit about 5  minutes until soft; chop enough to make 1/4 cup.
