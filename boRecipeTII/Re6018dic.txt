Melt remaining butter; butter a pan abt. 2 inches smaller than the  phyllo.  Put 7 to 8 phyllo sheets, buttering each before addint it, into  the pan, letting phyllo extend on all sides. Pour in meat mixture and  spread it ivenly.  Fold overlapping phyllo back onto meat. Butter these  well.  Carefully cut remaining sheets of phyllo to fit the top of the pan.  Brush each with butter and lay on the filling to make the top of the pitta.  Pour on any remaining butter and sprinkle the top very lightly with a  little water (to keep phyllo from rising too high).
