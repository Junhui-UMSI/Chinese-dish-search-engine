Dry Red Wine, Onions; finely chopped, Whole black peppercorns, Rosemary, dried, Trout;*, Mint, fresh; finely cut, Bay leaf; crumbled, olive oil, Egg yolks; lightly beaten, Salt, Water, Thyme, dried, 
* 8 to 12 ounces each, cleaned but with heads and tails left on    In a flameproof glass, enamel or stainless-steel baking dish large enough  to hold the fish in one layer, combine the red wine, olive oil, water,  onions, mint, rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns and salt, and stir  thoroughly. Wash trout under cold running water and dry them completely  with paper towels. Then place them in the marinade, turning them about to  coat them thoroughly. Marinate at room temperature for about 30 minutes,  turning the trout over after       15    minutes.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. On top of the stove bring the marinade  to a simmer, then lay a sheet of wax paper or foil lightly over the baking  dish. Bake in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes, or until the fish is  firm to the touch. Be careful not to overcook.    With a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to a heated serving platter and  cover loosely with foil to keep them warm. Strain the cooking liquid  through a fine sieve into a small saucepan, pressing down hard on the  onions and herbs with the back of a spoon before discarding them. Whisk  about 1/4 cup of the liquid into the beaten egg yolks, then whisk the  mixture into the remaining liquid in the pan. Heat slowly, whisking  constantly, until the sauce thickens lightly. (Do not let it come anywhere  near a boil or it will curdle.) Taste for seasoning.    Pour the sauce over the trout or serve the sauce separately. Traditionally  the trout are accompanied by hot, freshly boiled potatoes.
