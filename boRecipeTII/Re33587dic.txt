PREHEAT OVEN TO 375 DEGREES 1. In a small bowl or 2 cup measuring cup, beat  the egg until foamy. 2. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and blend well. 3.  Add the baking soda, one teaspoonful at a time, sprinkling it in and  beating until the mixture is smooth and the consistency of light cream. 4.  Add the lemon juice all at once and blend into the mixture. Stir, but do  not beat (you want it creamy, but without a lot of air) 5. The mixture will  congeal into a pasty lump.  Scoop it out of the bowl with a spatula and  spread it on a floured surface. 6. Sift the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar  together and use the fingertips to work it into the egg- lemon mixture. 7.  With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out 1/32 thick and with the tip  of a sharp knife, cut out angel shapes and twist the edges up to form a  shell-like curve about 3/8" high. Sprinkle on the remainder of the sugar.  8. Brush each angel with melted butter. 9. Place the angels one inch  apart on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 12 minutes or until golden  brown.
