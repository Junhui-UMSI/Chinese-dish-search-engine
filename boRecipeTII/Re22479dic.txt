Sort the beans to make sure they are free of stones or other debris. Rinse,  then cover with cold water, refrigerate, and soak overnight. The next day,  drain the beans, place them in a large pot, and cover with the stock. Bring  to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer the beans for 1 1/2 to 2 hours,  or until they are tender. Add 1 teaspoon of salt in the final 15 minutes of  cooking. The addition of salt earlier in the cooking process will result in  tough beans.    Remove the beans with a slotted spoon and transfer to a large mixing bowl.  Add all the remaining seasoning and other ingredients to the warm beans in  the bowl and toss together. Adjust the salt and a dd freshly ground pepper  to taste. Serve warm or chilled.    >From Michaels Place Show # 1A23    Recipe by: Michael Lomonaco Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #533 by "Master  Harper Gaellon" <gaellon@inch.com> on Mar 21, 1997
