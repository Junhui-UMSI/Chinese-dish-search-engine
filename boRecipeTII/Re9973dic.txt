Purim Patties
(dry roasted) unsalted, Chinese noodles, Chocolate chips, 
Linda asked what other pastries for Purim. Well here is a sweet that is not  a pastry or a cookie but a delightfully delicious and easy to make sweet  that I include in my shalach manot gifts. Its especially fun to make with  the children (and grandchildren, of course) because its fast and theres  not baking or real cooking involved. When its not Purim, we call them  spiders, but on Purim we call them "Purim Patties". Makes about 3 dozen    Mix the noodles and peanuts in a large bowl and set aside. Melt the  chocolate chips in a double boiler (NOT in the microwave) and, when melted,  mix with the noodle peanut mix. Mix well so that everything is coated with  the chocolate. Drop by teaspoonsful onto a waxpaper-covered cookie sheet  until set. (In humid Florida I sometimes set them in the refrigerator.)  These keep indefinitely, in the event there are any left over.
