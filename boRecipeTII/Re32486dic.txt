I know there was a request for lowfat cornbread muffins and granola bars.  Here are a couple of recipes I came across yesterday in "Secrets of  Fat-Free Baking" by Sandra Woodruff, RD.    Combine the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and baking soda, and stir to  mix well. Add the buttermilk, molasses or sugarcane syrup, and egg whites,  and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in the dates.    Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray, and fill 2/3 full with the  batter. Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes, or just until a wooden tooghpick  inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.    Remove the muffin tin from the oven, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes  before removing the muffins. Serve warm or at room temperature.
