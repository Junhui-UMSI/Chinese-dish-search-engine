Baked Fish
Lemon juice, Pepper, Fish fillets, Margarine, onion, 
If fish fillets are large, cut into 5 or 6 serving pieces. Sprinkle both  sides of fish with salt and pepper (I dont). Mix margarine or butter (I  use butter), lemon juice and onion. Dip fish into margarine/butter mixture;  arrange in ungreased square pan, 9 x 9 x 2 inches. (I always use a longer  pan).Pour remaining mixture over fish.    Cook uncovered in 350 degree oven until fish flakes easily with fork, 25 to       30    minutes.    I served this with kind of a rice pilaf:  I stir fried sliced fresh  mushrooms, celery and onion, sauteed, and then added cooked rice to the  veggies, and also had fresh asparagus.
