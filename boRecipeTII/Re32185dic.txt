CUT THE PIECE OF PORK BUTT in half. Cut the two halves into 3/4-inch  strips. Put the strips in a bowl with the marinade and mix well to coat  them thoroughly. Marinate at room temperature for 3 hours, or overnight in  the refrigerator. Remove the pork from the marinade and baste the strips  with the malt-sugar mixture. Use curved skewers (available in Chinese  cookware shops and some restaurant- supply stores) to hang the meat from  the top shelf of the oven over a large pan filled with water to a depth of  1/4 inch. Roast the pork at 350F for 45 minutes, basting occasionally with  the malt sugar or honey. Increase the heat to 425F and roast for 20 minutes  to finish the pork. When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut it into  1/2-inch slices. Arrange the pork slices on a platter. Serves 4 to 6 as a  main course accompanied by vegetables, 8 to 10 as an appetizer.
