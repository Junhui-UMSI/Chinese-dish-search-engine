Beat the eggs  slightly with a wire whisk, add milk and seasonings, and beat a little  more. Stir in the crabmeat and pour into individual buttered casseroles.  Cover and bake in a medium oven (350 degrees F) 30 minutes. Serves four.    I found this recipe in an old cookbook I picked up at a yard sale.  The  title, 150 Recipes  Casserole Cookery  One-dish Meals for the Busy Gourmet  and the authors are Marian and Nino Tracy and it was first printed in 1940!  The last print date is October 1950! I hope that you get a kick out of some  of these recipes. Trish.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #66    From the MealMaster recipe list.
