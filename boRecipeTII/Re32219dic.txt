Barbecued Shrimp on a Stick
shrimp, 
This is a simple recipe that you can use to add a bit of color to the  barbecue buffet. Purchase large shrimp in the shell and skewer them on  bamboo barbecue sticks. Place them in your cooker when everything else is  just about finished. They will take only a few minutes to cook and the  smoke flavor on the shrimp is just wonderful. Be careful not to overcook  this delicacy.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
