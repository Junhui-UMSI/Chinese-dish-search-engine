Beat at medium speed until well mixed. Stir  in raisins and zucchini. Pour into greased 13x9x2" pan. Bake at 350 for 50  minutes or until done. Cool.    This recipe was given to me by my mother and originally had oil instead of  the applesauce. I replaced the oil with applesauce and was very suprised at  how good the cake still was. It has a rubberly-like texture (it was the  same with oil) but is very good unfrosted. I keep mine covered with plastic  wrap in the fridge after it has cooled. The eggs are the worst fat  contributors to this recipe. Ellen Markovich    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
