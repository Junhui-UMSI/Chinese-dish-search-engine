Vegetable Gumbo
Tabasco sauce, Onion, Green pepper, Paprika, Tomatoes, Vegetable Bouillon granules, Celery, Garlic, Water, Okra, Vegetable coating spray, White Grape Juice, Basil, Fresh parsley, Corn, 
Method: In a large heavy stew pot, place bouillon and 1/2 C white  grape juice, onion, green pepper, celery garlic, cook until tender,  5-7 minutes. Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring  occasionally to keep from sticking to bottom. Cover and simmer gently  until corn and okra are done. (or simmer in crockpot 6-7 hours)    Note:  Cut fresh corn from cob with a sharp knife, then scrape the  remaining corn off the cob.  Four ears will make about two cups. If  you use dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before  adding to the pot, this releases their aroma and goodness. Exchanges:  1 Veg, 1 Bread, and 107 calories.
