Place pumpkin in large bowl and ladle out stew, scooping  out some of pumpkin with each serving. Makes 6-8 servings.    While this is not necessarily just a Halloween recipe, we have made it many  times for Halloween parties as the main course. I have probably posted it  before here, but since we have so many new people, thought I would do it  again. It always gets rave reviews.
