Combine sour cream, butter, 2 tablespoons grated cheese, salt, pepper and  paprika; stir over low heat to melt cheese. Remove from heat and mix in  chives; toss lightly with zucchini. Place in a buttered 1 1/2-quart flat  baking dish; top with crumbs and sprinkle with additional cheese. Bake in a  preheated 375F oven for about 10 minutes.
