Potty Jello
*****  NONE  *****, 
Purchase the plastic bowl that fits in a childs potty training chair (they  sell them at places like KMart).  Wash the bowl and prepare lemon jello per  package directions.  Float miniature O-Henry bars in it, refrigerate, and  serve.  Get the picture?  Next fun recipe.  Have you ever seen a recipe for Aquarium Jello?  You take  blue jello, make it in a clean glass aquarium bowl.  Float gummy fish and  plastic people for swimmers and plastic plants and stuff.   Well, what wed  do for a Halloween party would be to make a Toxic Aquarium.  Mix orange and  blue jello to get a sickly shade of green.  Lifesavers make old tires and  you can toss in other junky things for trash on the bottom of the sea.  Something barrel-shaped for that illegally dumped toxic waste. Float your  fish upsidedown on top, and add a plastic skeleton or two. Havent figured  out a good way to put something on the bottom to represent the sand, tho.
