Microwave at high (100%) ten minutes. Reduce  power to medium (50%). Microwave until beef and potatoes are tender, 50  minutes to 1 hour, stirring after half the cooking time. If using oven  other than carousel, stir 2 or 3 times during cooking. Let stand 5 to 10  minutes.  Serve over rice, noodles or potatoes, if desired.    This recipe is from the Sharp Carousel Microwave Cookbook. I made it for  dinner tonight because I had only an hour to make dinner and only had a  roast thawed. I cut the roast into cubes, and I almost made the time limit,  but not quite. It was very good.
