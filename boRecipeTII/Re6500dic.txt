Poached Egg Rice
-(up to), Oyster sauce, Water, Rice, Eggs, 
1. Boil or steam rice (see recipes).    2. Bring water to a boil in another saucepan. Break eggs one at a time onto  a flat dish; then gently ease into boiling water. Reduce heat to medium and  poach until the egg whites set, but the yolks are still moist.    3. Arrange cooked rice on a serving platter; top with poached eggs.  Sprinkle eggs lightly with oyster sauce and serve. VARIATION: At the end of  step 1, while the rice is still in its cooking pot, make four indentations  in its surface with the bottom of a glass. Then break a raw egg into each  indentation. Cover the pot and let stand 1 to 2 minutes. (The hot rice will  cook the eggs.)    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.
