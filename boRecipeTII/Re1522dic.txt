Broccoli Frittata, Parma Style
Unsalted butter, olive oil, Onion, Garlic, Cooked ham; or, Canadian bacon; chopped, Broccoli florets; small, Strands cooked spaghetti;, Eggs, Parmesan cheese; freshly, Crushed red pepper, 
1- Heat 3 tablespoons of the butter with the oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet  over medium temp. Saute the onion until golden. Add the garlic and ham;  cook 3 mins. Stir in the broccoli flowerets and spaghetti; toss until well  coated with the mixture. Remove from heat.    2- Beat the eggs in a large bowl until light. Add the broccoli mixture and  all but 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan.    3- Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Pour  in the broccoli-egg mixture. Immediately reduce the heat to low; cook,  without stirring, 20 minutes.    4- Using a long spatula, carefully loosen the edges of the frittata and run  the spatula underneath to loosen the bottom. Place a shallow plate over the  skillet and quickly invert the fritata onto it.    5- Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium-low  heat. Carefully slide the frittata back into the pan. Sprinkle it with the  crushed pepper and the remaining cheese. Cook 5 minutes longer. Serve (from  4 to 6) from the pan, in wedges -- at any temperature, "This is the very  best Italian fritata [Bert had] ever sampled."
