Tamales #3
Pork shoulder, Garlic, Water, Masa harina, Salt, Ground red chile, Lard, Dried corn husks, -(up to), Ground oregano, Flour, 
This recipe is taken from _The Best of New Mexico Kitchens_ cookbook.  Like  it says in the book, making tamales is a lot of work but you get a high  yield and they freeze well.    Cover the pork with water, add the garlic, and bring to a boil.  Simmer  gently, covered, until meat is tender.  Cool slightly.  Discard the garlic.  Chop the meat and set aside.  Mix the chile powder, oregano, and flour with  2 cups of the meat stock and add this to the chopped meat. Bring to a boil  and simmer gently until mixture is thick. Cool. Beat the lard until it is  light and fluffy. Blend in the masa harina. Then add enough meat stock or  water to make the mixture soft and pliable. You should be able to spread it  easily, but it shouldnt be soupy. Soak the husks in hot water until they  are soft. Drain. Spread a thin layer of masa on a husk. Put a heaping  tablespoon of the meat mixture down the center of the masa. Roll the husk  carefully around the meat filling. Wrap another husk from the opposite  side.  Dont squish them! Tie ends with string. Stand the tamales on their  ends on a layer of corn husks in a steamer or blancer. Steam for about an  hour.  Drain and serve with more red chile sauce and beans.
