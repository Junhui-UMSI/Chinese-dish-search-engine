Soak the beans in water to cover overnight.    To make the gnocchi mix the flour and bread crumbs in a large mixing bowl.  Add the milk, salt and pepper and mix well. Knead the dough on a floured  board until well blended. Divide the dough into three equal parts, allow to  rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Take the dough and form into long, narrow  cylinders, about 1/4 inch in diameter. Cut the dough into small pieces the  size of your pinky nail. Dont allow them to stick. At this point, you can  freeze them for future use or cook them right away.    To make the sauce drain the beans and cook in enough salted water to cover  by 1 1/2 inches until tender, about 20 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a  saucepan over medium heat and saute the pancetta for 2 to 4 minutes. Add  the garlic, carrot, celery and onion. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes; do not  brown. Add the wine and cook until it reduces by half. Add the tomatoes,  drained beans, basil and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, lower the  heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.    When the sauce is almost done, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil  over high heat. Drop the gnocchi in and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until  they float. Drain well and place in dishes or bowls. Spoon the sauce on top  and serve immediately.    Yield: 4 servings as an appetizer or first course    NOTES : Recipe courtesy of David Ruggerio, "Little Italy"    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9059    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Feb 7, 1998
