Enjoy!    Make sauce by sauteeing onion, garlic, bell pepper, herbs and salt for 8-10  minutes.  Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to a boil, then simmer,  partially covered, for 25-30 minutes.  You can do this way ahead of time  and let the sauce sit for a few hours till youre ready to make lasagna.  Add parsley at the last minute. When youre ready to make the lasagna, add    1 1/3 c. water to the sauce (this cooks the noodles - if you are using  cooked noodles, dont add water).    To make lasagna: Preheat oven to 375.  Mix spinach and ricotta thoroughly  (add a pinch of salt).  Pam a 9x13 baking pan.  Spread some of sauce in the  bottom of the pan.  Cover with a layer of dry lasagna noodles (1/3 of  them). Place glops of the ricotta mixture here and there (use half). Add  1/3 of the sauce, followed by 1/2 the mozarella. Sprinkle with Parmesan.  Add second 1/3 of the noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, andother 1/3 of  the sauce, and cover with remaining mozarella and more Parmesan. Add a  final layer of noodles, the rest of the sauce, and sprinkle to top with  Parmesan.    Cover very tighly with aluminum foil.  Bake for an hour, or until the  center is tender when pierced. Let stand at least 10-15 minutes before  cutting.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #42    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
