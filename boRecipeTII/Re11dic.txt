These are some pretty good recipes for chileheads.   The original recipes were from Emeril, but I have kicked it UP!   I have used habaneros dried and  powdered for the Jerk Spice mixture.   If I had access to Datil Peppers I  think that would be the best!    Combine first 8 ingredients in a bowl or in a food processor. Season swordfish with jerk spice and drizzle with oil. Place on grill for 3  minutes. Spoon 1/4 of rub on each fish and flip to other side.   Spoon the rest of the rub on each fish and cook 1 minute. Remove and serve over salsa.    For the salsa, heat orange juice in pan over the grill until warm.   Add mangos, cilantro and salt and pepper and let cook for 3 minutes without  boiling. Spoon onto plate and over arugula.  Place swordfish over salsa.
