(I got this last spring from Cooking Light, they had a whole section on  potato salads and we tried four or five of them that we still use  constantly.  I will share two tonight)    Place potatoes in water, bring to boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20  minutes.  Cut potatoes into quarters, ditto artichokes.  Add olives, onion,  and parsley.    Combine vinegar and next six ingredients and stir well.  Pour over potato  mixture and toss gently.  Serve warm or cover and chill.  8 servings.
