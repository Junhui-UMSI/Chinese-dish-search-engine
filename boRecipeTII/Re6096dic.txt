Beat until smooth. Stir in enough flour to make dough  easy to handle.  Turn dough into lightly floured surface; knead until  smooth and elastic (5 minutes). (Dough is ready if an indentation remains  when touched). Heat oven to 500 degrees. Form dough and put on cookie sheet  (can sprinkle with corn meal first). Slide onto stone after stone is  heated.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #47    From the MasterCook recipe list.
