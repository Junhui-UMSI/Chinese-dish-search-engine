Wild Rice -- Basic Recipe
Salt, optional, Wild rice, Water, 
Rinse rice throughly in a strainer. Place the wilr rice and water in a  heavy 3 liter saucepan, (salt optional). Most chefs prefer to add salt  after cooking. This procedure generally ensures proper grain expansion and  the enhancement of natural wild rice flavour. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to  low boil, cover loosely and cook 45 to 60 minutes, or until rice has puffed  and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat. Fluff rice with  fork, cover tightly and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain off any excess  water. (For a softer texture wild rice, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more water when  cooking.)    Add additional flavour by serving with butter, margerine, salt or spices.    Makes about 1 quarter, or 5 to 6 servings.    NOTES : "A Gift from the Great People:"  Wild Rice -- Manomin to Indian  People. "Since Indian People first presented wild rice to the early fur  traders, this unusual grain has been prised as a distinguished rare gift.  "Actually a tall water grass, wild rice is the only cereal grain native to  North America. "Wild rice enhances meat, poultry, fish, shellfish and wild  game.  Enjoy it in side dishes, caseroles, soups, salads, breads, snacks,  and even desserts. We hope you enjoy its sweet nutty flavour. "Wild rice is  one of natures most nutritous gifts, high in fiber, low in fat (130  calories per cup), rich in protein, minerals and vitamin B. "Wild rice is  an excellent choice for people who are nutritionally conscious about what  they eat. "Wild rice expands 4 times when cooked, thus providing many more  servings per pound over white or brown rice and therefore establishing  affordable costs per serving."
