7-Layer Mexican Dip
Jalapenos, Sour cream, Refried Beans, Tomatoes, Taco Seasoning, Olives, Onion, Avacados, Cheese, 
Mix the refried beans and taco seasoning together (I also mix the chilis  in with this, but some people put the chilis as a layer) Mix this really  well (I used a food processor, but today I am going to use my mixer). This  is the first layer.    Put a layer of sour cream on top of the refried beans, taco seasoning and  chilis.    Next put a layer of well mixed/mushed avacados (you need enough to cover  the pan, I use a cake pan normally) on top of everything else    Next sprinkle cheeses on top (I just thought about it and I put the avacado  first and then the sour cream, but I suppose it doesnt matter). I think the  more cheese the better myself *grin*!    Next cut up tomatoes and add as many as you like, which I like to use at  least 2 cut up tomatoes.    Last put chopped up olives.    Put in the oven until the cheese is melted. I use a low heat so that  everything else warms up.    Last but not least pull out the chips and dip! Everyone really enjoys this  dip. I hope you do too.
