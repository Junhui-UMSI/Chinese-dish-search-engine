Touch of Grace Biscuits
Bleached; All-Purpose Flour,, Salt, Self-Rising Flour; A, Shortening, Nonstick cooking spray, Sugar, Baking soda, Buttermilk; Up To 1 1/4 Cups, Butter, 
1. Preheat oven to 475 and spray an 8-inch round cake pan with the nonstick  cooking spray.    2. Combine self-rising flour, soda, salt and sugar in a medium mixing bowl.  With you fingers or a pastry cutter, work the shortening into the flour  mixture until there are no shortening lumps bigger than a big pea.    3. Stir in the buttermilk and let stand 2-3 minutes. This dough is so wet  that you can not shape it in the usual manner.    4. Pour the cup of all-purpose flour onto a plate or pie tin. Four your r  hands well. Spoon a biscuit-size lump of wet dough into the flour and  sprinkle some flour over the wet dough to coat the outside. Pick up the  biscuit and shape it roughly into a soft round. At the same time, shape off  the excess flour. The dough is so soft it will not hold its shape. As you  shape each biscuit, place it in the pan. Push the biscuits tightly against  each other so that they will rise up and not spread out. Continue shaping  biscuits in this manner until all the dough is used. To make a large batch  of biscuits in a hurry, spray a medium small (2-inch) ice cream scoop with  nonstick cooking spray. Cover a jelly roll pan with the all-purpose flour.  Quickly scoop the biscuits onto the four, sprinkle with flour and place in  small pans.    5. Brush the biscuits with melted butter and bake just above the center of  the oven until lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. Cool for 1 or 2 minutes int  he pan, then dump out and cut the biscuits apart. "Butter em while theyre  hot!" Split the biscuits in half, butter or spread with a flavored butter,  and eat immediately.
