Ceia De Natal (Brazilian Christmas Turkey) Pt 2
See part 1, 
While its roasting, make sure to baste the turkey at regular intervals  with the remaining marinade, about every half-hour. Remove the foil for the  final 20 minutes of roasting to crisp the skin and turn it a rich golden  brown.    To present, serve slices of white meat surrounded by peaches and prunes on  a large platter, and the pieces of dark meat on a separate platter  accompanied by the dressing.
