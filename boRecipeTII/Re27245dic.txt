Beat the egg whites.  You should beat *15* minutes by hand  or ~3.5 - 5 by machine. You should have about 20 - 30 times your original  volume.  Put sugar in egg yolks.  Beat them.  Youve beat enough when the  color becomes light lemon instead of orange.  Put the mascarpone in the egg  whites stir until well mixed.  Put yolks in too.  Beat again.  It must  become very homogenous in texture and thick enough that it will barely drip  off the beater. Lay a thin layer into the casserole dish. Mix the espresso  coffee & liquor (3-1) ratio. Take cookies & dip them into the coffe/liquor.  (just long enough that they absorb all the way thru, but dont get mushy.  Place them one by one, on top of the thin layer of mix in the casserole  dish.  When completed with one layer, cover with more mix. Do another layer  (two to three layers of cookies is just right). Grate the bakers choclate  (almost to a powder). Cover evenly (& pretty heavily) Refrigerate one night  , then eat!!!!!!!!
