Pork Chops in Crock Pot
Chili powder, Ketchup, Salt and pepper, Onions, Garlic, Worcestershire Sauce, Water, Pork Chops, Vegetable oil, 
Cook onions in oil until lightly brown. Add other ingredients. Cover and  simmer about 20 minutes. Put pork chops in crock pot and cook 8-10 hours  with sauce. Serve hot.    Notes: What I do is mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl place a little  on the bottom of the crock pot add a few chops sprinkle with some of the  onions then another layer of the sauce, rest of chops, onions and top with  remainder of sauce. I dont bother cooking the onions in oil either. Find  it a waste of time. And I omit the oil.    Posted to T.nt (sdm-marked) Recipes Digest by Laurie <lcouv@ican.net> on Mar 26, 1998
