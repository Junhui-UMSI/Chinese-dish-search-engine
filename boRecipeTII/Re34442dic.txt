Bean Dip
Vinegar; cider preferred, Beans; cooked, Onion; minced, Salt, Cumin powder, Chili powder, Grated cheese, Green chili peppers; canned, Tabasco sauce, Oregano; crushed, dried, Garlic powder, 
drain freshly cooked hot beans and toss into food processor with remaining  ingredients.  Process until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth.  Taste,  adding additional vinegar and or seasoning to taste.  Serve hot with chips  or tortillas.    Serves well in a cock pot or bean pot heated in an oven at 350 degrees for  30 minutes. The heavy ceramic hold heat and keeps the dip warm longer.    Can also be used as a sandwich filling or burrito filling.    Original recipe by Roberta Bishop Johnson, Champaign, Illinois.

Black beans also work well  Green Chilis are optional.  Use Jalapanos if there are chili heads to be  fed. Cheese can be cheddar, colby, jack, etc. Fetta works well as does  mixed cheeses. Vinegar amount can vary from 1 to 4 tablespoons depending on  the amount of chili Tobasco and chili powder are optional (for  not-chili-heads) I like a chipolte chili or two in this for heat and flavor  Author noted that family thought there was something wrong with the flavor  of the dip, but could not identify it until the dip was gone -- and what  was wrong was the dip was gone.
