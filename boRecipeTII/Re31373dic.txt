Barbs Potato Soup
BARB DAY, Bacon; diced, milk, Egg noodles, Heavy cream, Cabbage; chopped, Butter, Chicken broth, Potatoes; peeled, diced, Butter, Onion; diced (See note), 
Note: I like to prepare onion by placing it in a covered vessel and  placing it in the microwave on high, (skin on) for about 5 minutes. When  the onion is done, the skin can be slipped off easily, and the onion  chopped.  This is equivalent to sauteeing to the point where the onion is  translucent, but for this dish the onion still needs to be sauteed. Using  this method cuts out the tears and most of the odor, not to mention, no use  of fat! Cook the bacon in the butter until it is lightly browned, then add  the onion and cook for a few minutes, until the onion just begins to brown.  Add the cabbage, and cook until it is very limp. Now add the diced  potatoes, and chicken stock. Salt and pepper to taste.   Cover and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender. Add the noodles on  top of the mixture, and cover again. Cook for about 6 to eight minutes, or  until the noodles are almost done.    Add the milk and cream, and the 2 tablespoons of butter, and correct  seasonings. Stir and cover the pan again. Cook over low heat just until  warmed through.    Serving Note:  You might like a little crisp fried, crumbled bacon and/or  chopped chives or green onion tops as a tasty garnish.
