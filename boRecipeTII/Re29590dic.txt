Tartufo
Chocolate -- coarse chop, Cocoa, Heavy cream, Instant expresso or coffee, Water, Sugar, Rum, Maraschino cherries, Egg yolks, 
Soak cherries in rum. Sift sugar; cocoa, and instant coffee together and  place in a heavy sauce pan. Add the water and mix well. Bring to a boil and  cook until everything is well mixed. While syrup is cooking, whip the egg  yolks until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed of the beaters to the lowest  level and add the hot syrup in a continuous fine stream. Continue beating  until the mixture is thick and forms a ribbon pattern when the beater is  pulled away. Chill well. Whip the cream with the 2 tablespoons of rum until  stiff. Fold into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the chopped chocolate.  Arrange foil lined paper cups in a muffin pan. Fill each cup 1/3 of the way  full. Place a cherry in each cup then fill the rest of the way. Freeze at  least 4 hrs. Before serving pipe whipping cream on top if desired. It will  keep in the freezer for about a month.
