Quickie Cookies a la Stove Top
Vanilla, Sugar, Oatmeal, milk, peanut butter, wheat germ, Butter or margarine, Cocoa, 
Combine sugar, cocoa, butter and milk in a saucepan and boil over med heat  for 1 min.  Stirring constantly, fold in remaining ingredients. Drop with a  teaspoon on wax paper and let harden.  Work quickly because the hardening  doesnt take long.  Store in an airtight container because they can also  dry out.    From "The Taming of the C.A.N.D.Y.
