Process the ingredients according to the  manufacturers instructions for the basic bread  setting. Remove the bread from the bread pan to a rack  to cool.  Wrap in aluminum foil ior a paper bag to  store. This is for a 1 1/2 pound loaf.  I have set the  serving for "3" if you make a 1 pound loaf, set the  servings for "2" and let the great MM make the  conversion for you.
