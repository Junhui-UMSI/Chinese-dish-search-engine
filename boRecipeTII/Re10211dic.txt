I liked the outcome and actually ate it with ff sorbet and also  by the spoonful. Its possible that some people who like to experiment  could suggest improvements, like added flavorings or extracts or honey.  Depending on the temperature served, it could also be a sauce or the base  of some kind of mousse. Dont worry about the buttermilk contributing a  strong flavor, IMHO, the flavor was more sweet and cocoa-ey.    Combine cocoa and brown sugar in a saucepan.  Gradually add buttermilk,  stirring Cook (low-to-medium heat) until sugar dissolves, whisking to  remove lumps. Remove from heat. The sauce will thicken as it cools. Store  in refrigerator in tightly sealed container. Makes about 3/4 cup  sauce/frosting.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #107    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
