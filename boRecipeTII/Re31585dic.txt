Swirled Mint Cookies
Butter or margarine, Baking Powder, Sugar, Egg, Peppermint extract, Green food coloring, Vanilla, Flour, Red food coloring, 
1. Combine flour and baking powder. In a large mixer bowl, beat butter or  margarine till softened. Add sugar and beat till fluffy. Add egg, vanilla,  and peppermint extract and beat well. Add flour mixture and beat till well  mixed. Divide dough into thirds. Stir red food coloring into one third,  stir green food coloring into another, and leave the remaining third plain.  Cover each and chill about 1 hour or till easy to handle.    2. Divide each color of dough into four parts. On a lightly floured  surface, roll each into a 1/2 inch diameter rope. Place one red, one green,  and one plain rope side-by-side. Twist together to swirl the colors. Slice  the twisted ropes into 1/2 inch pieces for larger cookies, or 1/4-inch  pieces for smaller ones. Carefully roll into balls, blending colors as  little as possible. Place about 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie  sheet.    3. Flatten to 1/4 inch thickness with the bottom of a glass dipped in  additional sugar. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake in a 375 degree oven  until done (8 to 10 minutes for larger, 6 to 8 for smaller.) Remove and  cool. Makes about 72 (2 1/2 inch) or 144 (1 1/4 inch) cookies.
