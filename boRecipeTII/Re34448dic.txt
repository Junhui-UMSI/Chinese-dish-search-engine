Bean Dip
Rosarita non-fat refried, To four cloves of garlic, 
Put about 1/3 of the beans and the other stuff in a food    processor and chop into a soupy mess.  Add the rest of the beans, then  enjoy with Guiltless Gourmet non oil added    tortilla chips or homemade greaseless corn tortilla chips.    This snack/mini meal is very easy to make, but it sure tastes good to me.
