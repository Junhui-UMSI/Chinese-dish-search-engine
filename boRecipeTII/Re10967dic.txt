Raclette #1
raclette cheese, potatoes, Gherkins, 
From: dan hirschi <vfoao0cy@huey.csun.edu>    Date: Thu, 5 May 1994 11:07:41 +0800 (PST)  I have tried Raclette that my parents brought back from Switzerland.  I am  still having trouble finding it in Los Angeles--One store (Trader Joes)  says they normally stock it in the fall...    There are Raclette machines sold in Switzerland.  One appears to be a stand  for the half-wheel of cheese and a heating element to melt it.  Another  looks like a toaster oven with individual trays to melt slices of cheese  with other toppings...    Lacking both devices, I resorted to gently melting slices of the cheese in  a non-stick frying pan and pouring the liquid cheese on the peeled, boiled  potatoes.  This worked fine and tasted great.    taken from "A Taste of Switzerland" by Sue Style    Light a good fire.  Buy yourself a half wheel of real Raclette cheese,  preferably from the Valais (Gosmer, Bagnes, Orsie`res etc.), between three  and five months old. Scrape off the rind, top and bottom, so that the  cheese can melt more easily. Prepare boiled potatoes in their skins and  have a ready supply of gherkins or cornichons, pickled onions and black  pepper.  When the fire died to a mass of glowing embers, procure yourself a  large flat stone and put it before the fire. Set the half cheese on top,  its cut surface exposed to the heat. Nearby have a supply of plates. As the  cheese melts, scrape it off on to a plate and serve it at once. Continue  this way until everyone is full.
