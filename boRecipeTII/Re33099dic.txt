Its lighter in  texture, and less flat than some recipes, but tasty nonetheless:    For the sponge: Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large mixing bowl.  Whisk it in and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in flour.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let stand until bubbly and doubled in  volume, about 45 minutes.    For the dough, sprinkle yeast over warm water. Let stand until creamy,  about 5-10 minutes. With a wooden spoon, stir the yeast mixture and the  olive oil into the sponge and mix well. Stir in 1 c of the flour and the  salt.  Stir in enough remaining flour to produce a soft dough. Knead on a  lightly floured board until soft and smooth, about 6-8 minutes.    Place dough in a lighly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise  until doubled 1 to 1 14/ hrs or overnight in the fridge.    Divide dough in half and press into two lightly oiled 9" round cake pans.  If dough shrinks from the sides, let rest a few minutes then stretch it  again. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes or  until dough is full of air bubbles. Just before baking, press your  fingertips deep into the dough all over the surface to dimple the loaf.  Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt.    Bake at 425 deg. for 20-25 minutes until top is golden.  Remove from pan  and cool on a wire rack.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
