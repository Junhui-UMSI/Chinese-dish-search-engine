Worlds Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
Salt, Eggs, nuts, Semi-sweet chocolate chips, Flour, Vanilla, Granulated sugar, Brown sugar, Butter, Baking soda, 
This recipe is said to have come from a famous cookie maker. So make,  bake, and compare to see if these cookies arent "the real thing." One  feature that distinguishes these cookies from traditional chocolate chip  cookies is their perfect size. It comes from using a small size ice cream  scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet.     Preheat oven to 350?.     In a large bowl, combine sugars; add in butter and cream together with the  sugar. Add vanilla and eggs; mix together.     In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients and add to the creamed  mixture. Mix well; the dough will be stiff. Add the chocolate chips and  nuts (if using).     Line the cookie sheets with baking parchment or wax paper. Drop dough with  a small ice cream scoop onto the sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes at 350?. Remove  from oven and cool on wire racks.     Variation: For ice cream sandwiches, turn one cookie face down, place a  scoop of ice cream on it and top with another cookie.    Yield: 2 1/2 dozen.
