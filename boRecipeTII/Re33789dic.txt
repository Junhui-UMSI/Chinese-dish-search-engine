I. Melt butter in a heat-resistant, non-metallic broiler-proof skillet on a  conventional surface unit. When butter is hot, sear lamb chops on both  sides until lightly browned. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Or use  the "browner" for 4 to 5 minutes per side. 2. While the chops are browning,  drain pineapple juice into a small heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl.  Reserve pineapple chunks; add brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch and brown  bouquet sauce to pineapple juice. Stir to combine. 3. Heat pineapple juice  mixture, uncovered, 2 minutes in Micro- wave Oven or until thickened and  clear. 4. Pour thickened sauce over browned lamb chops. 5. Add carrot  slices and heat, covered, 5 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add pineapple chunks  and heat, covered, 2 1/2 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add green pepper  squares and heat, un- covered, in Microwave Oven 2 1/2 minutes, or until  lamb and vegetables are tender. Variations: Pork chops, veal chops,  boneless chicken pieces or shrimp may be substituted for the lamb chops;  however, cooking times will have to be adjusted for pork, chicken, and  shrimp. Pork chops will require an extra 2 minutes in Step 5, as pork  should always be cooked to well-done. Chicken should be cooked for only 4  minutes in Step 5 and shrimp 3 minutes.
