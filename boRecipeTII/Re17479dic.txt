Walts Habanero Jelly
Cider vinegar, Orange bell peppers, Canning lids, Dry Pectin, Sugar, canning jars, Habanero Chiles, Butter, 
Seed and stem bell peppers, cut into pieces and process in a food  processor. Do not puree. Seed and stem habaneros leaving as many seeds as  you want heat.  Process in a food processor as with the bell peppers.  Removing the seeds will remove part of the vein, therefore the heat. Use  only the small amount if you want a milder jelly. 	Place sugar in a  separate bowl.  Place the chiles, bell peppers, vinegar, dry pectin and  butter in a large stainless steel pot. Bring this to a rolling boil (one  that does not stop when stirred). Stirring constantly. 	Add sugar  immediatly to chile mixture. Return to a rolling boil and boil exactly one  minute.  Stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off any foam.  	Immediatly fill jars to 1/8 inch from the top. Cover with flat lids and  screw bands tightly. Invert jars for 5 minutes to distribute the chiles.  After jars are cool check seal by pressing middle of top with your finger.  If the bubble springs up jars are not sealed.
