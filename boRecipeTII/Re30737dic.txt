First make the marinade.  Put the chopped onion, garlic, ginger, and lemon  juice in a blender or food processor, and blend until you have a smooth  paste.    Place the paste in a bowl large enough to hold the chicken.  Add the  yogurt, spices, and food coloring.  Mix well.    Remove the skin from the chicken.  With a sharp knife, make two deep  slashes on each thigh.  Put the chicken in the marinade and stir until all  pieces are well coated.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.  (A large  sealable food storage bag is very helpful for marinating.)    Remove the chicken from the marinade.  Broil in the oven until thoroughly  cooked -- about 25 minutes -- or cook on a grill.    Serve garnished with thinly sliced onion rings and lemon wedges.    Per serving: 193.4 calories, 5.7 g. fat,  CFF 27.0%  *Garam masala is a spice mix used in many Indian recipes.  It is available  at Indian groceries, but is easy to make at home.  The following recipe  will make about 3 tablespoons of garam masala, more than is needed for the  Tandoori Chicken..    1 tablespoon cardomon seeds (NOT whole pods) 2-inch stick of cinnamon 1  teaspoon cumin seeds 1 teaspoon whole cloves 1 teaspoon black peppercorns  1/4 of an average-sized nutmeg    Place all ingredients in a coffee grinder or spice grinder.  Grind until  spices are finely ground.  This can also be done in a blender, though it  takes a little longer to get the right consistency.
