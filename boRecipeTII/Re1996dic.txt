Christmas Goose
Tangerines, (1/2 stick) butter, melted, Rubbed sage, Salt, Black pepper, Goose (8-9 lbs.) thawed if, Light brown sugar, Orange juice, Cornstarch, 
Preheat oven to 400F.  Finely grate tangerine peel and set aside  tangerines.  In a small bowl, combine the tangerine peel, 2 tablespoons of  the butter, the sage, salt and pepper. Place goose in a large roasting pan  and rub the butter mixture evenly over the entire goose. Quarter tangerines  and place in the cavity of the goose.    Roast 30 minutes.  Reduce oven temperature to 325F and roast 2 1/4 to 2 1/2  hours, or until no pink remains inside, juices run clear and the internal  temperature of the meat is 180F to 185F, basting with the pan juices every  30 minutes.  Allow to sit 15 minutes before carving.    Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine remaining melted butter and brown  sugar over medium-high heat. Heat 1 minute, or until sugar is melted,  stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, combine orange juice and  cornstarch; mix well.  Add to the butter mixture and heat over medium-high  heat, stirring until thickened. Reheat sauce before serving with the goose.  Tip:  For a pretty presentation, garnish the serving platter with  additional tangerines, clementine slices or kumquats. Yield: 6 to 6  servings.
