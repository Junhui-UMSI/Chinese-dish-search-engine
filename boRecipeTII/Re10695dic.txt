Quick Spaghetti
Black Pepper, Pasta sauce; hot, Parsley, Grated Parmesan cheese, Fresh spaghetti, 
Cook spaghetti in a large pan of boiling water 3-4 minutes, or until just  cooked through. Drain well and toss with remaining ingredients.  And to make the bread special....mix together equal parts mayonaise and  parmesan cheese and spread on bread, lightly sprinkle with garlic salt and  toast....I love to do this and have had many compliments on it....
