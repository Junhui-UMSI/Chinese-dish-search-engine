Sweet Yeast Crisps
Active dry yeast, All-purpose flour, sifted, Temperature, Salt, To 1 cup granulated sugar, Lightly salted butter or, Warm water, 
Combine the water and yeast in a small bowl; let stand for 2 minutes. In a  large mixer bowl, beat the butter and salt until creamy. Add the flour, 1/2  cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. (This can be done with an  electric mixer at low speed.) Stir in the yeast mixture. Cover the mixture  and chill for 1 hour.    Place 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in a pie plate or shallow pan. Drop level  tablespoons of the chilled dough into the sugar. Roll each tablespoon into  a ball and coat well with sugar. Place the sugar-coated balls in a shallow  pan and chill for 30 minutes.    Heat the oven to 375F.  On a well-sugared board, working with one ball at a  time, press additional sugar into the dough while you pat the ball into a  square.  Using a sugared rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a  square about 3 x 3 inches.  Cut each square diagonally into two triangles.  With a metal spatula, lift the triangles onto an ungreased baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining balls of dough.    Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let the crisps rest on  the baking sheet for 30 seconds before removing them to wire racks to cool  completely.    The crisps taste best when fresh, but can be stored in an air- tight  container.    Makes about 5 1/2 dozen wafers.    [ The Redbook Breadbook ]    Posted by Fred Peters.
