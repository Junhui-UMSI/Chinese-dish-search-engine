Bacon and Water Chestnut Tidbits
Bacon slices, Soy sauce, Canned water chestnuts, Brown sugar, 
Preheat the oven to 425F.  Drain the water chestnuts, rinse them in cold  water and pat dry.  Roll each water chestnut in brown sugar.  Cut the bacon  slices in half, wrap each half around a water chestnut and secure it with a  tooth pick.  Sprinkle with soy sauce.  Place in a shallow baking dish and  bake in the oven, turning occasionally, until the bacon is crisp, about 20  to 30 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and serve at once.
