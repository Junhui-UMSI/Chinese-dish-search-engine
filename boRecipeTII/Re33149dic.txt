Basic Leftover Casserole
Butter, garlic, Flour, Milk, chicken, Milk, Frozen vegetables, Cooked pasta, Onions, sharp cheese, 
Take the pasta or rice, the meat, and the veggies, and dump them into a 9x9  baking dish.  Make the sauce by melting the butter in a medium saucepan  over low heat. If you want to saute the onions or garlic or whatever add-in  youre using, use one more Tbsp butter. Add the flour and stir until  completely mixed into a thick paste. Add the milk and slowly bring to a  boil.  Lower heat and cook just until thick. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Remove the sauce from the heat.  Add cheese if making a cheese sauce. Stir  until melted.  Add desired seasonings to taste. Pour over top of casserole  mixture and stir gently until mixed well. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  Let stand about 10 minutes before serving. This is a great way to use up  leftovers, and its different every time you make it because you improvise.  Very easy, too, and it freezes well as long as youre not using a very hard  cheese (hard cheeses will separate and the oil will float to the top. Use a  breadcrumb topping if youve got a craving for Jarlsberg or Gruyere or  Parmesan.)    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS  1-201-822-3627  Posted by FAYLEN    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
