Mix dates and baking soda in a heat-proof bowl. Pour boiling water on top  and leave to stand. Cream butter and sugar until pale, then add eggs one at  a time, heating well after each addition. Gently fold in sifted flour, stir  in the date mixture, and pour into a lightly buttered 18cm or 7" square or  round cake tin. Bake in a preheated oven (180 C) for 30-40 minutes, until  an inserted skewer comes clean. Combine sugar, cream, vanilla essence and  butter in a saucepan, bring to the boil, stirring, and simmer for five  minutes. Set aside until ready to serve, then quickly reheat when needed.  Cut pudding into squares and place each square in the centre of a warm  dinner plate. Pour hot toffee sauce over each square and serve with fresh  cream.    Recipe By     : Jill Dupleix
