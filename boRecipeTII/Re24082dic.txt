1.  Preheat oven to 180 ?C .    2.  In a large bowl, break up tofu with a fork until it looks like cottage  cheese. Stir in the cottage and ricotta cheese until the mixture is  uniform.    3.  Put a small amount (50 ml) of spaghetti sauce in a large lasagne pan  until the bottom is thinly coated. Add 3 or 4 uncooked lasagne noodles  (they wont completely cover the bottom), then add enough sauce on top of  noodles so that about 1/3 jar of sauce is used up. Next add 1/3 of sliced  mushrooms, then 1/3 cottage cheese mixture, then 1/3 each of mozerella,  provolone, and parmesan cheese. Make two more layers of noodles, sauce,  mushrooms, cottage cheese, and sliced cheese.    4.  Cover the lasagne with foil, making a "tent" if you can so the top does  not touch to cheese. Make sure the edges are crimped tightly. Bake for 1  hour at 180 ?C (you can take the foil off the last ten minutes if you want  the cheese to brown), and let stand 15 minutes to set. The noodles will be  a little chewy, and the lasagne is also very good (perhaps even better!)  reheated. .SH "Alternate Baking Instructions:" Bake the foil-covered  lasagne for 45 minutes, then let cool. It can then be frozen or  refrigerated for baking later. If frozen - bake at 180 ?C (with foil) for  45 minutes. If refrigerated, bake at 180 ?C (also with foil) for 20  minutes. These methods produce softer noodles.    Difficulty    : moderate. Precision  : approximate measurements.    Recipe By     : Tracy Sconyers igor!yoda!tls@uunet.UU.NET
