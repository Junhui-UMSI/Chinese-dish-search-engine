Banana Nut Bread
Dry milk, Salt, Nuts;chopped, Yeast, Butter, Bread flour, Water, JONI CLOUD SSMW41A, Brown sugar, Cinnamon; or nutmeg, 
Just add as your B/M requires. I baked it on Bake Light in my Pan-1Lber.  It came out nice and high and Light, but I thought it could have more  banana s. I used 1/2 cup but would go to 2 small Bananas.Was also good  toasted. Good Luck and Enjoy from Mrs Tater-Head  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #484 by angstrom@juno.com (Angela  L  Gilliland) on Jan 01, 1998
