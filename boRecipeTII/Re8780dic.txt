Pozole (Pork Ribs and Hominy Soup)
County-style spare ribs, Salt and pepper, pork neck bones, Onion, white hominy, Water, garlic, 
Place first 6 ingredients in a large soup pot and cook for 45 minutes over  medium heat, partially covered.  Test for doneness after 30 minutes and  adjust heat accordingly.  Best to simmer the last 15 or 20 minutes.  As  soon as meat feels done but not falling off the bones, add hominy, juice  and all. Simmer for a few minutes more, and correct seasoning. Broth should  be very tasty.    Serve in large soup bowls, with dishes for bones handy.  Serve 2 ribs and  one neck bone per person.    Garnishes:  chopped green onions, crushed dry oregano leaves, chopped fresh  cilantro leaves, quartered fresh limes,  and crushed red pepper flakes.  Serve with garlic toast or hot garlic bread.
