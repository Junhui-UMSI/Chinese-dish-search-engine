Vegan Low Fat Artichoke Soup or Sauce
Plain artichokes , tabasco, Leek, , rice, Dried tarragon, Fresh lemon juice, 
Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan. Bring to a boil and then turn down  to a simmer. Cook for twenty minutes or longer if necessary until rice is  cooked. (It is OK if rice is mushy, because it will be pureed later  anyway.)    Put solids and a bit of the liquid into a food processor and puree. Mixture  will probably be a bit coarse. Return to the pan and stir into the rest of  the liquid. Return to stove and simmer uncovered for a few more minutes.  Mixture should be thick.    Be sure to use regular rice, not the minute or instant cooking variety.  This makes a thick soup or sauce which can be ladled over cooked noodles.  If mixture is not thick enough to suit you, cook longer. It will thicken.  If you prefer a thinner soup, you can use a bit more broth. (I have made  the soup with 4 cans of broth. After it is pureed it is very thin. I  usually have to cook it uncovered for at least another twenty minutes in  order to thicken it up enough to call it soup.)    Note: If you use 2 tablespoons of lemon, it is very tart and very "adult"  (in other words perhaps too tart for kids). You may wish to try one the  first time you make the recipe. I usually just use half a lemon and dont  bother to measure. But sometimes it is pretty tart that way if its a big  lemon.    Some recipes which call for leeks tell you to only use the white part. Not  so here. You can use some of the green, just dont use the leafy part at  the top. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #140 by Mezzatesta@aol.com on Jul 5,  1997
