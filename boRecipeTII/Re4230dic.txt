Perfect Popcorn Balls
Karo light corn syrup, Popcorn, popped, Sugar, Salt, Vanilla, Food coloring, 
Keep popped popcorn in warm oven. In a heavy saucepan, stir corn syrup,  sugar and salt, cook over medium heat. Stir constantly until mixture begins  to boil. Do not stir again. Cook on low without stirring for 4 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla (and food coloring now). Slowly pour over  popped popcorn mix with large spoon. When cool enough to handle, yet still  quite warm, quickly shape into balls. Keeping your hands lightly buttered  will keep mixture from sticking to your hands. Makes 12 (3 inch) balls.
