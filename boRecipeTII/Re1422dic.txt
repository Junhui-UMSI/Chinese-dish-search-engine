Never tried it with adobo, but now that you mention it.... Heres the stuff  a had on my cheese enchiladas tonight.    Heat the fat and flour over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until you  get a dark brown rioux. Add the onions and cook until tender. Add the  garlic and stir for a few seconds. Add the spices, stirring to blend them  and release their flavors, then immediately add the liquid (this is also  when I would add the adobo to taste).    Stir/whip/blend until the mix is smooth, then let it simmer for at least 10  minutes on low heat, covered.    You can strain it if you dont like the lumps of onion and garlic. If you  choose to use onion and garlic powders instead, put them in AFTER the  liquid and add a pinch of sugar.    And if you want, you can add chopped fresh chiles at the same time as the  onion.    Top the enchiladas with chives, green onion, crab meat, chopped fresh  tomatoes, olives, sour cream, or even roasted corn.
