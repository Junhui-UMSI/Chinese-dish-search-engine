Heat oven to 375 degrees..    In a bowl, combine apples, sugar, flour, spices to taste, cherries, lemon  juice and peel, and butter. Toss to mix; transfer to a buttered deep round  baking dish.    Into a bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Add  butter and shortening and blend with your fingertips or pastry blender  until it resembles coarse meal. Add 1 cup of the cream, stirring until  dough forms a ball. Be careful not to overwork dough. On a lightly floured  surface, turn out dough and pat into a 1/2-inch thick round. Use a 2 to 2  1/2-inch biscuit cutter to stamp out rounds. Gather scraps into a round and  stamp out more rounds.    Arrange rounds, lightly touching one another, on top of apple filling so  they form one continuous layer. Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons  heavy cream and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar to taste. Bake cobbler in  middle of oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until filling is bubbling and dough is  pale golden.
