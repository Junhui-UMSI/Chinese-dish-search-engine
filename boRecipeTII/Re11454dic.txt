Raspberry Borscht
Balsamic vinegar, Lemon juice; to taste, Water, Sugar; to taste, Raspberries, Sugar, Lemon juice, fresh, Beets; or more, Salt, Red onion; minced, 
Cut the tops off the beets, scrub them thoroughly, and put them in a  saucepan with enough water to cover them by an inch and a little pinch of  salt. Simmer the beets, covered, for 30 minutes if theyre small, closer to  45 if large. They must be tender.    Drain the beets, reserving the cooking liquid, and allow them to cool. When  you can handle them, peel them and cut them into quarters or eighths.    Combine the beets, raspberries, red onion, and 2 cups of the reserved  cooking liquid, and puree it all in batches in a blender. Strain the puree  through a sieve to remove the raspberry seeds. Stir in 1/2 cup of lemon  juice, the balsamic vinegar, and 3 tablespoons of sugar. Stir until the  sugar is dissolved, and taste. Add more lemon juice and more sugar only if  needed, until the right sweet-sour balance is achieved. You might need a  teensy pinch of salt, but be careful.    Chill the soup in the refrigerator, and when it is completely cold, taste  it again. Correct the seasoning if necessary. Serve in chilled bowls, with  a spoonful of sour cream in the center of each one.
