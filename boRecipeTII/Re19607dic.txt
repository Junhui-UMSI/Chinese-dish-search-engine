Annabels Rice Pudding
Pudding rice, Sugar, Cups, Imperial pint; 2 1/2 US, 
Bring the milk to the boil, then pour over the rice and sugar. Then EITHER  bake in a very low oven for about 2 hours, or, which I prefer, stir on a  low heat on the top of the stove until the rice is cooked. This will not  thicken all that much until it is cold, but when cold it is deliciously  creamy.
