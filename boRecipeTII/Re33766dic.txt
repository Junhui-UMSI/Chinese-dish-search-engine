Sweet and Sour Cucumbers
Salt, Celery seed, Sliced onions, Sliced cucumbers, Vinegar, Mustard seed, LIQUID, Sugar, 
This is from the back of a vinegar jar - Heinz, I think.    Sprinkle salt over cucumbers and onions.  Let stand 1 hour.  Drain.    Mix liquid ingredients together and pour over cucumbers.  Refrigerate 24  hours.  (This was a big hit when I took it to a friends house at Rosh Hashanah  time)    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #86    Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 09:26:38 -0600    From: mlefko@dct.com (Marsha Lefko)
