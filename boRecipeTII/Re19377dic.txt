Vegetable-Stuffed Trout
Onion, Assorted seasonings, Lemon juice, Trout, about, Green pepper, Margarine, 
Clean and scale the trout.  Wash carefully.  You can leave the heads on if  you like.    Cut up the green pepper and onion into bite-size chunks. If youre feeling  experimental, try adding a bit of tomato (or whatever).    Melt the margarine in a microwaveable dish big enough to accommodate the  fish. Stir in the lemon juice. Roll the fish around in the lemon-butter  mixture and sprinkle with seasonings to taste. Add the vegetables to the  dish (dont put them in the trout yet).    Cover loosely to prevent spatters (a paper plate or wax paper works fine)  and microwave on high power for about 7 minutes, or until the fish is  opaque and flaky and the vegetables are tender. Flip the fish over and stir  the vegetables once or twice during this time. Scoop some of the vegetables  and sauce into the body cavity before serving.    NOTES:    *  Stuffed trout cooked in a microwave oven -- I prefer fish cooked in the  microwave to ordinary baked fish, because it doesnt get dried out. The  texture is similar to what you get when you cook fish wrapped in aluminum  foil outdoors over a wood fire. Its also much less work!    *  This recipe is for a standard 600 to 700 watt microwave oven.    : Difficulty:  easy if you know how to clean a trout.  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.  : Precision:  No need to measure.    : Sandra Loosemore  : Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA  : {decwrl, utah-gr!uplherc}!esunix!loosemor    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
