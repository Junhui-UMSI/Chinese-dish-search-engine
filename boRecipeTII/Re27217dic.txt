Toast the pecan  halves on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 10  to 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Combine 1 1/4  cups of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt  saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will  resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 8 to 10  minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly  with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will  first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as  it caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Add the unsweetened chocolate and stir gently to  blend. Pour the chocolate-caramel mixture over the  pecans and stir with a spoon to completely coat the  pecans with the chocolate caramel; spread the mixture  evenly over the bottom of the baking sheet. Freeze the  chocolate pecan crunch for 20 minutes. Remove from the  freezer. Chop the chocolate pecan crunch into 1/4"  pieces. Store in a sealed plastic container in the  freezer until needed.
