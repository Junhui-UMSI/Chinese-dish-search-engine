Stuffed Baked Brie
Scallion, Garlic, Mushroom, olive oil, Crescent Roll Dough, Maggi sauce, Brie Cheese, 
Saute onions and scallions in olive oil, just until translucent and  aromatic. Add mushroom pieces and continue to saute until most of the  moisture has evaporated. Stir in Maggi Sauce. Saute 1 minute more. Set  aside and let cool. Open Crescent roll dough and unroll carefully, pressing  the seams together as you go, to form a large square. Remove rind from top  of brie round. When mushroom mixture has cooled, spoon mixture into center  of dough square. Top with cheese round, cut-side down. Wrap dough up around  cheese, taking care to seal all openings. Trim off excess dough. Sprinkle  with chopped pistachios. Place seam-side down on a baking sheet covered  with parchement paper. Bake at 350F for 12-15 minutes, watching that the  dough doesnt get too browned. Remove from paper.
