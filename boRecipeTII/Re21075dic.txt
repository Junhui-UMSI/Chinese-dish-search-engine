Recipe by: The New McDougall Cookbook Preparation Time: 0:40     Saute the onion, garlic, oregano, and pepper in a small amount of water  until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside.     Dice the remaining vegetables, except the tomatoes, and place them in a  large pot; add the sauteed onion mixture. Add water just to cover the  vegetables.  Add the bay leaves, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat.  Simmer unti the vegetables are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.     Place the tomatoes in a blender or food processor and process until  pureed.  Pour into a saucepan and gently boil for 20 minutes to remove any  acidic taste.  Add the tomatoes to the soup, along with the cooked beans.     Cook for 30 minutes over low heat.  Refrigerate overnight to allow the  flavors to "marry."  Reheat and serve the next day.    83 calories, 0.5 grams fat per serving.    Variation:  One-half cup each of corn and green beans can also be added to  the soup.
