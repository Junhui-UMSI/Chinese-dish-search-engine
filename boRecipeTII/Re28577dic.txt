1. Prepare a very hot charcoal fire. 2. There should be about 6 individual  steaks. Cut each of these in half. Blend the oil, 2 tsp garlic ans 3 tbsp  vinegar in a flat dish. Add the steaks, turning to coat the pieces well.  Set aside. 3. Core the tomatoes but do not peel them. Cut them into 1/4-in.  cubes and put them in a mixing bowl. Add the onion, chilies, coriander,  remaining garlic and vinegar. Blend well. Set this sauce aside. 4. Put  about 4 slices of steak at a time on the hot grill and cook for 1 min. or  less to a side, depending on the desired degree of doneness.  Simultaneously, add a similar number of tortillas and cook them for a few  sec. to a side just to heat through. Do not heat for for long or they will  dry out. 5. Place one piece of steak in the center of a warm tortilla,  spoon a little sauce over the meat and fold the side of the tortilla over  the ends up to enclose the meat. Eat like a sandwich.
