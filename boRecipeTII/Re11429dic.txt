Heat oven to 350. In large mixer bowl combine sugar, butter and almond  extract. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy (1 to 2  minutes). Reduce speed to low; add flour. Continue beating until well mixed  (1 to 2 minutes). Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 2 inches apart on  cookie sheets. With thumb, make indentation in center of each cookie (edges  may crack slightly). Fill each indentation with about 1/4 teaspoon jam.  Bake for 14 to 18 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Let stand 1  minute; remove from cookie sheet.    In small bowl stir together confectioners sugar and 1-1/2 teaspoons almond  extract. Gradually stir in enough water for a thin glaze. Drizzle over  cooled cookies.    Makes 3 1/2 dozen cookies. Store in airtight containers up to 1 week or  freeze up to 3 months.    Tip: If cookies are spreading too much, chill dough 1 hour or stir in 1 to        2    tablespoons flour.
