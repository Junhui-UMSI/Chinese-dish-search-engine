Cook 3 - 5 minutes until mix  just begins to run golden.  Add chicken stock gradually, whisking to  prevent lumps, until liquid thickens. Reduce heat to simmer and add  potatoes, cream, chopped bacon, parsley, garlic, basil, salt, pepper sauce  and black pepper.  Simmer 10 minutes; DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL. Add grated  cheese and green onions.    Heat until cheese melts smoothly. Garnish each serving as desired with  chopped bacon, grated cheese and chopped parsley.
