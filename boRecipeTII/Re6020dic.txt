Pix Rowe Millers Family Fish Chowder
Potatoes; peeled, Diced yellow onions, Cod, Bacon; 1/4" thick, Haddock, Evaporated milk; (3 cups), Whole Milk, Black Pepper, Salt, 
Fry the bacon, remove from the pan, and place on a paper towel. Saute the  onions in the bacon fat and set the pan aside. Cut the potatoes in half the  long way, then into 1/4" slices. Put them in a nonreactive pot large enough  for the chowder. Cover the potatoes with water and boil until tender. Be  careful not to put in too much water or the chowder will be soupy. While  the potatoes are cooking, cut the fish into generous bite-sized pieces.  When the potatoes are ready, add the fish to the pot, cover and simmer  until the fish flakes. When the fish is done, crumble the bacon and add it  to the pot along with the onions and any grease in the pan, the evaporated  and whole milks. Bring the mixture to boil, cover, and turn the heat down.  Simmer for five minutes and add salt and pper to taste. Chowder invariably  tastes better when made a day ahead.    According to Katherine Hall Page.... The Rowe recipe may be happily  modified in all sorts of ways. The chowder is still quite delectable with  olive oil instead of bacon fat. You may also use salt pork. Two kinds of  fish make for a more interesting chowder, but these can be any combination  of the following: haddock, cod, pollack, monkfish and hake. Finally there  is the question of garnishes: dill chopped parsley, oyster crackers, butter  are all good. And Faith and Pixs friend on Sanpere, Jane Weiss, swears by  her chowder to which she adds curry spices!
