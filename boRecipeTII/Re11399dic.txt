Suhour ("the meal before sunrise") is usually good, stick-to-your-ribs  food.    Rinse lentils and drain, picking out any discolored ones. Combine  with 5-6 cups water in a large kettle and bring to a boil. Lower heat  and simmer for 20 minutes, skimming off foam as it forms on top.    While the lentils are cooking, combine ground meat with parsley, salt  and pepper. Using about a tablespoon of the meal mixture for each,  form into small meatballs and chill until needed.    Heat the olive oil and saute the onion until soft and golden. Reserve.  When lentils are soft, mash them with the back of a spoon to thicken  the soup. Add shaarla (or vermicelli) and meatballs. Cook 10-15  minutes longer, until meatballs are cooked through. To serve, divide  onion slices among 6 bowls. Stir lemon juice into soup and ladle over  onions.    Makes 6-8 servings.
