Raspberry Vinegar - Rons Easy Method
Ripe Raspberries, Wine Vinegar, 
Take the raspberries and soak them for at least 10 days in the wine  vinegar.  Strain the mixture through a fine sieve or muslin cloth  [cheese-cloth].  Heat the mixture to just under boiling.  Cool and bottle  in sterilised containers. Sterilise [we spell it this way!] Colonials  should substitute a z    :-) Rons note: You can substitute strawberries and make Strawberry Vinegar  if you wish!    ron@crocks.com.uk  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #009 by scotlyn@juno.com (Daniel S Johnson)  on Jan 8, 1998
