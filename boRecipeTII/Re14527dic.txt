My favorite is Jackie Mannis  recipe for "cream" of corn soup:    Saute onion and corn in a few tspns of water, adding more if it gets dry.  Add cornmeal, stirring to avoid lumps, and so all veggies are covered.  Slowly add water and stir to once again avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, then  simmer for 40 min. Add salt/tamari at end.    I am not a big soup fan, but I had 2 bowls of this stuff. The best part is,  you can make a ton and not have to cook for a while.
