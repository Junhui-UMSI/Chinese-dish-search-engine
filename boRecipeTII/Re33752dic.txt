In a medium bowl, mix together the egg, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the  ground chicken and 2 tablespoons of the flour. Sprinkle the remaining flour  on a sheet of waxed paper. Drop the chicken mixture by heaping teaspoons  onto the floured waxed paper and roll in the flour to form balls.    Heat the canola oil in a nonstick frypan over high heat. Add the chicken  balls and cook, turning, until brown, about 6 minutes. Remove the chicken  balls and drain on paper towels. Drain the oil from the frypan, reserving 1  tablespoon.  Drain the juice from the pineapple into a measuring cup; add  water to make 1 cup liquid. Add the bouillon cube to the pineapple juice  and stir to dissolve.  Place the frypan over low heat; add the pineapple  chunks and green peppers. Stir and cook for about 2 minutes. Combine the  cornstarch, sugar and ginger in a small bowl; stir in the soy sauce and  vinegar until smooth.  Add the pineapple juice and then the cornstarch  mixture, stirring, and cook until clear and thickened, about 5 minutes.    Arrange the chicken balls over sauce and serve with hot cooked rice and  crisp Chinese noodles.    [THE EVENING SUN; January 2, 1991]    Posted by Fred Peters.
