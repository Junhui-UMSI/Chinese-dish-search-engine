Melissa Hill Moore    "Salsa jalape=F1a;" is a fiery condiment made with ripe jalape=F1o chilis.  It can be replaced in this recipe with any hot sauce that suits the taste.    Combine all the ingredients and cook thoroughly over very low heat. Be very  careful, since it burns easily.    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 09, 1998
