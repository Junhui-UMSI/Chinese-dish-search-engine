It is particularly important not to allow the filling of this tart to boil  ~ it might do so towards the end of its cooking time.    Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC/500 oF.    Lightly butter and flour an 18 cm ( 7 in) tart tin with a removable base.    Line the prepared tart tin. Blind-bake it for about 10 ... 15 minutes,  protecting the edges with aluminium foil. Leave it to cool in its tin.    Reduce the oven temperature to 190 oC/375 oF.    Whisk the egg, egg yolks, sugar and cream together, making sure the sugar  dissolves.    Arrange the raspberries on the bottom of the pre-cooked pastry shell,  pointed ends facing upwards, in concentric circles. Cover them with the egg  mixture.    Bake the tart for about 40 minutes in the bottom of the oven. WATCH VERY  CAREFULLY TO SEE THAT THE FILLING NEVER REACHES BOILING POINT.    When the tart has cooled completely, take it out of the tin.    (From: Fredy Girardet, Cuisine Spontanee, M Papermac, ISBN 0 333 40957 4)
