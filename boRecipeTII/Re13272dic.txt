WW Dry Cream Soup Mix
Cornstarch, Dried onion flakes, Pepper, Basil, Powdered nonfat milk, Chicken broth mix, Thyme, 
Combine and store in an airtight container. Use 1/3 cup of mix to 1 1/4 cup  of water. For extra thick, use only 1 cup of water. 1/3 CUP   1/2 MILK AND  30 CALORIES. Servings are a guess. Could combine this with cheese for a  topping for vegetables  or baked potatoes. Also could use mix with tuna  over toast.
