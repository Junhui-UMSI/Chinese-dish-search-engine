Mix chicken, sherry, soy, and salt. Let sit for at least 30 min. Mix  in beaten egg. Combine cornstarch and flour (this makes a coating that  approximates water chestnut flour). Dredge chicken cubes in flour,  shaking off excess. Let rest for a few minutes. Deep fry in hot oil  (360) for 2 (for white meat) to 3 (for dark meat) min. Drain on paper  towels and keep warm.    Saute ginger and garlic in oil over high heat. Add rest of sauce  ingredients. Add peppers and stir-cook for 1 min. Add pineapple and  lychee/orange. Raise heat to high high. Mix cornstarch with water and  mix in. Taste now for seasoning - if it needs a little sugar,  vinegar, or salt, add that now. When sauce thickens and turns glossy,  it is ready.    MEANWHILE, reheat the kettle of oil to high (375) and refry the  chicken for 2 min or until its golden and crispy on the outside.    Add chicken to sauce and vegetables, toss, and serve with white rice.    Recipes posted to FIDO COOKING echo by Mike Loo, an excellent cook, between  Dec 1, 1944 and Jul 31, 1995.
