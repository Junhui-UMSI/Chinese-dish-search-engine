Salt the pork for several days then cut into pieces, wash, dry and fry on  both sides in hot butter. Put into a pot with sauerkraut on top. (If the  sauerkraut is too sour, soak it in water and drain). Add the quarter pound  of butter, apples, white wine and sugar, cover and cook slowly for 2 hours.  When it gets too dry, pour in some water. For the meat dumplings chop the  pork and veal; add the soaked roll, the egg, the tablespoonfuls of butter  and onion, mixed. Shape into dumpling and fry well done in the butter in  which the fried ribs have been. Serve the sauerkraut in the middle of the  platter, the ribs around it and the dumplings piled on top in a heap.    Taken from "Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book" by J.
