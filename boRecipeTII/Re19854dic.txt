Peel and core apples and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Dice fennel. Toast and  peel hazelnuts. Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces.    Combine  apples, fennel, lemon juice, honey, cider,  sambuca, nutmeg,  allspice and salt in a bowl; toss gently to combine. Cover and set aside.    Topping: Combine sugar, nuts, flour and salt in a processor.  Pulse until  nuts are finely ground. Add shortening and butter and pulse until mixture  resembles coarse meal. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing briefly  after each addition.  Continue adding water until mixture holds together  when pinched between your fingers. Do not overmix or the dough will be  tough. Pat into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 30  minutes.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    Spoon the apple mixture into a 9 x 13-inch glass baking dish.  Roll out the  dough on a lightly floured surface to a 9 x 13-inch rectangle; gently lay  the dough over the fruit, tucking in the edges. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove  from the oven and, using a spoon or spatula, break crust into 3- or 4-inch  irregular squares.  Press pieces into the apples, "dowdying" the appearance  of the dish. Return to oven and bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.  Let cool 15 minutes before serving.
