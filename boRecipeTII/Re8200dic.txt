Boil potatoes until done; put through a ricer or mash them. Heat the milk  and butter in saucepan to boiling; stir in potatoes, flour, eggs and salt.  Remove from heat and beat to form a ball.    Roll dough out into ropes about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into 1-inch pieces.  Roll each piece over the tines of an dinner fork with the tines turned down  (this makes ridges in the gnocchi). Drop into a kettle of boiling salted  water, simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Gnocchi are done when float to top. Serve  with butter and grated cheese.    >From Cook and Tell by Liz Caesar, 18-Feb-98, Riverside Press-Enterprise.  Topic: Gnocchi (pronouced no-key or yo-key, Italian, for dumplings).
