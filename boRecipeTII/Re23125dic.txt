*Dark Jamaican rum may be used. To be made as a wedding cake, many rituals  would have to be performed during the making of the cake. This is a  nonritual version. Sift the ground almonds and flour together to make a  very fine mixture. Add the salt, spices and baking powder and mix well. In  a separate bowl put the grated carrots and the nectar. Add the lemon rind  and juice. Cover and let stand. Cream the margarine and sugar together.  Separate the eggs, putting the yolks in with the margarine and sugar and  saving the whites for later. Beat the egg yolks in and then add the carrot  mixture. Stir well and let sit for a few minutes. Beat the egg whites until  soft peaks form, then set aside. Add the dry ingredients to the carrot  mixture and mix well. You should have a thick batter. Now beat the egg  whites a little more and fold the batter into the egg whites. Mix gently  until it is just barely evenly mixed. Pour into a greased ring mold. Bake  at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes. It is done when a skewer comes out  clean. Take out of the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Unmold onto a  serving plate dusted with confections sugar (this prevents the cake from  sticking as much).
