Sprinkle agar  flakes on top of the heated juice; allow to simmer for 3 minutes with the  flakes floating on top to soften the agar, then stir the agar flakes into  the juice. Simmer 5 minutes more, stirring well.    Mix the kuzu with the remaining 1/4 cup juice. Stir to blend out lumps.  Pour the kuzu mixture into the simmering juice & agar in the saucepan. Stir  until thick & clear. Add the fruit. Wait for it to rise to the surface.  Turn off the heat. Add the vanilla extract. Allow to cool a bit. Stir to  distribute fruit evenly. Chill until set.    Notes: Vary flavors of fruit juice (berry, cherry, peach etc).  Select  fruit that matches or complements fruit flavor.
