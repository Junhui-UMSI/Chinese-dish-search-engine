These two recipes are from the Honolulu Advertiser, sometime around 1979.  They were a Sunday morning treat, still warm from the bakery.    In the bowl of an electric mixer, soften yeast in water for 5 minutes. Stir  in sugar, butter, salt, lemon extract, 1 cup flour, eggs and cream. Beat on  medium speed for 2 minutes. Then with a heavy duty mixer or spoon, stir in  about 1 cup of the remaining flour until smooth.    Dough will be soft and sticky.  Cover and put in a warm place to rise until  almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.    Beat down dough to expel air, turn out onto a well-floured board and form  into a loaf.  Cut dough in pieces.  Shape each into a ball and then stretch  it into an irregular circle about 5 inches in diameter.    Place doughnuts on lightly greased cookie sheets, cover with clear plastic  wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 20 minutes.    In a deep frying pan or a 5 quart kettle, heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of salad  oil to about 350 degrees.  Add doughnuts, a few at a time, and fry,  turning, until they are golden brown.    Drain on paper towels.  Generously coat warm doughnuts with sugar. This  recipe makes 8.
