The  flaked  barley  has no husk, so I saw no reason  not  to  grind  it  finely.  Mash in at 130 degrees. Let rest 20 minutes or so. Mash at  150  degrees  for 115 minutes. Sparge. Let the spargings settle. What  seemed to  be 3 or 4" of hot break settled out of the initial  spargings!  Boil for 2  hours. Add hops as follows: 14 grams bullion and 16 grams  cascade (very  fresh) for 1:45. 10 g bullion and 14 g cascade for 1:05. 4  grams  hallertauer finish. Chill with an immersion chiller, and strain the wort  through the hops. Makes about 5.5 gallons of 1.068 wort. I had 374 out of  450 pt * gals of possible extraction, so an  efficiency of about 85%.
