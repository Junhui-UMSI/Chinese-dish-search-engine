Cauliflower Dish
Whole cauliflower, Onion, Garlic, Stick margarine, (8 oz) tomato sauce, 
Source: Amit Women cookbook/Efrat chapter (Chicago ARea)    Cook whole cauliflower until medium done. (I nuked it the night before and  then put it in the fridge). Separate into flowerets. In a pot, melt 1/4  stick margarine. Add one lg. chopped onion and two cloves garlic, minced.  Saute lightely. Add 8 oz. can tomato sauce. Bring to a boil Add  cauliflowerets. Simmer 15 - 20 minutes. Serve hot or cold.    Notes: I only stirred the cauliflowerets into the sauce and then put it in  the oven for the two hours until we ate; it held up fine. I felt it needed  a little more sauce and a little more kick - I added a squirt of ketchup  and it added that little something.
