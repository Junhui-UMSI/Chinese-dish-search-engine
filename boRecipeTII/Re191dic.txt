Ladyfingers
Eggs, Sugar, Vanilla, All-purpose flour, Salt, 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.   Grease and dust with flour a large baking sheet or 2 smaller ones.   Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they hold soft peaks, then beat in 2 tablespoons of the sugar and continue beating until the whites are very smooth, shiny, and stiff.   Using the same beaters, beat the egg yolks with the mixer until light colored and doubled in size.   Gradually add the rest of the sugar and continue beating until very thick and tripled in size.  Beat in the vanilla.    Sift the flour and salt together, then fold it and the egg whites into the egg yolk mixture, alternating the two.   Work lightly to keep the mixture as voluminous as possible.   With a large spoon or spatula, carefully transfer the batter to a pastry bag if you have one or into a heavy duty Ziploc plastic bag with a corner cut off.   Spoon or pipe the batter out onto the baking sheet(s) in finger shapes about 4 inches long and 1/2 inch wide.  You should have about 2 dozen.   Dust lightly with confectioners sugar.  Bake for about 20 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges.   Remove from the oven and transfer the ladyfingers to a rack to cool.     Makes about 24.
