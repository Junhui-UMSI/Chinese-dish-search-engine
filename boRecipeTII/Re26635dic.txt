Cook the noodles according to the directions on the pack. Cut the onions  and garlic into fine pieces. Make little balls of the minced pork and fry  this together with the sausages in a wok or wide frying pan. Then add the  cooked noodles and stir-fry. Now add all the vegetables, soy sauce, shrimp,  ham, and spices, add salt and pepper to taste ans stir-fry till it is  thoroughly hot. Serve on a plate. Add soy sauce, Sambal Oelek, or Sambal  Manis to taste.  Sambal Manis (dark hot condiment) is used more with these  two than the soy based pork ones.                                --- Jen Kuiper      Typos by Kath http://www.cyberspc.mb.ca/~pickell/recipe.html    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #255      Date: Tue, 17 Sep 1996 22:38:03 -0700      From: Julie Bertholf <jewel1@ix.netcom.com>
