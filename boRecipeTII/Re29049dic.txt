This served 2 easily and would have served 3.  Pre-warm/cook everything,  assemble it in a casserole, top with mozzarella and bake it about 15  minutes.    PastaZesta is a new product for us. Its a spaghetti, homemade, dried, flat  like soba, made of durum wheat, flavored with various - we chose tomat and  basil.  No eggs!  Very light and flavorful.  Cooks in 3 minutes. It comes  in a tan 8-oz box and was near the bottled sauces. We recommend it. Made in  Canada.    STEP #1  Using a micro-wave proof dish, like a pyrex measure, combine the  tomato sauce, garlic, basil, oregano and red pepper flakes.  Zap at 100% fo  about 2 minutes (700 watts). Stir and let stand.    MEANWHILE prepare the pasta.    STEP #2  Heat oil in skillet.  Press some (what you can) wheat germ into th  slices of mushroom and saute over medium-high heat, turning once, about 1  1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Remove from heat.    STEP #3  Set oven temperature to 375oF.  Place drained pasta in a shallow  casserole. Pour half the sauce on top and spread.  Season with pepper (a  little salt).  Sprinkle on remaining wheat germ, especially along the outer  edge where it will catch the sauce. Layer the mushroom slices on top of  that. Pour on the remaining sauce. Top with cheese. Top with parsley. Bake  about 15 minutes until cheese is melted and beginning to brown.    Nice served with asparagus.
