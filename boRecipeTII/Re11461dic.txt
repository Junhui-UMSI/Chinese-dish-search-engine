Its incredibly easy to make, and its  sinfully delicious.  A caveat: if you should use a store-bought jam instead  of homemade, you will be struck by lightening.  :-)    Melt chocolate.  Cream the butter and sugar.  Add the beaten eggs and blend  well, then gradually stir in the cooled chocolate.  Add the flour, and stir  to mix. Stir in the walnuts.    Put the batter into a buttered 9" pan.  Drop teaspoonfuls of the jam at  random on top of the batter.  Then swirl the jam with a fork to incorporate  it into the batter. Bake at 350o for 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted  comes out almost clean; do not overbake.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
