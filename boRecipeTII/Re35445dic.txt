Beef in Guiness
parsley, fat, Onions, Seasoned flour, Guiness, Shin of beef, Carrots, 
The Guiness in this recipe has the same function as the wine in Coq  Au Vin - the acid & moisture combined with the long, slow cooking  help tenderise the tough but flavoursome meat. Cut the beef into  chunks & peel & slice the onions & carrots. Toss the beef in the  flour & brown quickly in hot fat. Remove the beef & fry the onions  gently until transparent. Return the beef & add the carrots & the  liquid. Bring just to the boil, reduce the heat to a very gentle  simmer, cover closely & cook & cook for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Check that  the dish does not dry out, adding more liquid if necessary. Sprinkle  with chopped parsley & serve with plainly boiled potatoes.
