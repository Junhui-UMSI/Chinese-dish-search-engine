Appetizer Sandwiches
Loaf GOOD square white bread, Mayonaise, Asparagus (long stems), Butter, Salt and pepper, 
carefully remove asparagas spears from tin, spread on towel to drain for at  least two hours ;(if some are very "fat" split in half.  remove crusts from  bread carefully spread each square with butter, and then spread carefully  and generously with mayonaise. take a spear and put diagonal on bread -  sprinkle generously with S & P roll from corner to make a tube. I then cut  the tube in half to make smaller portions - your choice pile in bowl or on  plate, cover with aluminum foil (putting in Tupperware doesnt seem to have  the same effect, who knows why) Refrigerate for several hours. Remove from  frig at least 1/2 hour before serving.    So - easy right - make it in the morning - and the 1/2 hour out of frig is  while youre driving to the party ... every party I took these two they  were the first thing gone, men, kids, everyone said, these are weird, humm  but good!
