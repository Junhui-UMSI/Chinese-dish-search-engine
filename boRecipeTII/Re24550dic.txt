Rinse spears, pat dry and cut into 1 1/2 pieces, reserving tips.  Strain  stock or broth into a large saucepan and add the asparagus stalks, shallot,  potato and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the liquid to a boil over high  heat and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes, or  until asparagus is tender.    Meanwhile, in a saucepan of boiling salted water blanch the asparagus tips  until just tender, drain and refresh.    In a food processor or blender puree the soup in batches until smooth,  correct seasoning and return to saucepan. Heat until hot.    To serve: ladle soup into bowls and garnish with reserved asparagus tips,  yogurt, lemon peel and dill. Yield: 4 servings.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #102    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
