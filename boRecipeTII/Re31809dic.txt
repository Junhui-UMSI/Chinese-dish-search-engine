Carefully toss to mix thoroughly and set aside to marinate for 20  minutes.    2. In another large bowl combine cabbage, mushrooms, and sake. Toss well  and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.    3. In a small bowl mix together arrowroot and 3 tablespoons of the cold  water. Set aside.    4. In a fourth bowl mix together flour, eggs, and the remaining water.  Extract tofu from its marinade and dip slices into flour batter. In a  flat-bottomed skillet, over medium-high heat, heat safflower oil and saute  tofu on both sides until lightly browned. Remove tofu and set on a platter.    5. In a wok over medium-high heat, stir-fry contents of both bowls of  marinade for 5 minutes, then add arrowroot mixture and cook until mixture  thickens (about 2 minutes). Add tofu, cover, and steam 1 minute. Serve  immediately.
