Winter-Warmer Soup
Carrots, Tomato pur√©e, Turnip, Potatoes, pearl barley, vegetable stock, Spanish onion, salt and pepper, Dried mixed herbs, Leeks, 
Fill a very large saucepan with lid, if possible 2/3 full with cold water  and put it on to boil. This will take a long time, so peel and chop or  slice the onion, carrots, turnip/swede and potatoes. Trim the leeks, slice  down one side, and rinse them thoroughly in cold running water. Chop them  into 1/2 inch rings. Stir the stock cube into the boiling water. Add all  the prepared vegetables, the mixed herbs, and the pearl barley or rice as  you like. Turn down the heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally,  until the potato has cooked enough to thicken the soup and all the other  vegetables are tender, but still recognizable. It needs about 40 minutes.  Add more water if required, a little at a time. Adjust flavor with salt and  pepper, and tomato puree if liked.
