Using a sharp knife, cut the corn from the cobs and  set aside. In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of butter and saute the  onions and zucchini for 3 to 5 minutes over medium heat. Remove. Add  another tablespoon of butter and saute the tomato and tomatillos for 3 to 5  minutes.    Lightly grease a large casserole. Combine all the vegetables together;  season with oregano, salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the grated cheese and  dot with a little butter.    Bake the casserole, covered with its lid or with foil, for 30 minutes.  Run  it briefly under the broiler to brown before serving.
