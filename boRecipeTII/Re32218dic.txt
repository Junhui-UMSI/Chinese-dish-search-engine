Barbecued Shrimp Brushed with Creole Butter
Unsalted butter; softened, Large shrimp; shells on, Shallots, Worcestershire Sauce, Cayenne pepper, Fresh oregano leaves;, Lemon; cut in wedges, Garlic, Black Pepper, Fresh thyme leaves, Salt, Freshly ground white pepper, 
Using small, sharp scissors, snip along the top ridge of each shrimp shell.  Using a small knife, cut into the top surface of the shrimp to reveal the  vein, then rinse it away.    In a food processor, mince the garlic, shallots, oregano and thyme. Add the  butter, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and peppers and process until  thoroughly blended. Fit the Creole Butter between the shell and shrimp and  refrigerate. Set aside the lemon wedges. The recipe up to this point can be  completed 8 hours in advance of cooking.    Preheat a gas grill to medium (350#161#F). When the grill is preheated,  brush it with oil, then place the shrimp on the grill. When the shells turn  pink on the underside, turn the shrimp over. Cut into a shrimp to test for  doneness. The shrimp are done when the shells turn pink and the shrimp meat  has lost its raw inside color, about 6 minutes. (Alternatively, preheat the  oven to 500#161#F. Then turn the oven setting to broil and broil the shrimp  4 inches from the heat for about 6 minutes.)    Serve the shrimp immediately on 4 heated dinner plates accompanied by lemon  wedges and napkins.
