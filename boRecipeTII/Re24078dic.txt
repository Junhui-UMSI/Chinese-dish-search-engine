Toxic Aquarium Jello
See below, 
Well, what wed do for a Halloween party would be to make a Toxic  Aquarium. Mix orange and blue jello to get a putrid shade of green.  Lifesavers make old tires and you can toss in other junky things for  trash on the bottom of the sea. Something barrel-shaped (root beer  barrels?) for that illegally dumped toxic waste. Float your fish  upside-down on top, and add a plastic skeleton or two. Havent  figured out a good way to put something on the bottom to represent  the sand.
