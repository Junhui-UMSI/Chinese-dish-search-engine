Reserve the wine broth and allow it  to stand and cool. Discard the bayleaf from the contents in the colander  and allow remainder to cool for 1/2 hour.    Gently ladel off the wine broth until the liquid containing the sediment  equals 2/3 cup. Save the clear broth in case you need more. Be sure to  catch all the sediment because it is an important part of the recipe.    In your food processor; combine the contents of the colander, sediment  broth, butter, mustard and 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Process until the  mixture is a smooth, soupy puree. Fold in remaining bacon and pour into  final mold. If it is too thick to pour, you need to add more broth. Allow  pate to set in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.    Unmold, lightly sprinkle with cracked peppercorns and garnish with sliced  olives and parsley.    This recipe is an antique French farm recipe reported to be over 100 years  old.
