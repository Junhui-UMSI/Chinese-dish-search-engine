Apple Surprise Salad
Snickers candy, -(up to), Red delicious apples;, Cool Whip, 
From:    Julie Sterchi <sterchi@WABASH.NET>    Date:    Sun, 18 Aug 1996 00:29:02 -0700  Fold apple chunks and Snickers cubes into Cool Whip.  Garnish with a fan of  thin apple slices.  Serve immediately; the apple juice breaks down the Cool  Whip after awhile, so dont make this ahead of time.  (This may sound  weird, but its delicious! It kind of reminds me of nut-covered caramel  apples from the county fair. Kids absolutely love this recipe.)    EAT-L Digest 17 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
