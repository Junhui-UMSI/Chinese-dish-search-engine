Barley Buttermilk Soup
chives, parsley, Buttermilk, Black Pepper, cilantro, Paprika, Water, Barley, Turmeric, dill, Salt, red onion, 
RINSE THE BARLEY and put it in a pot with the water and salt to taste.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer until the barley is tender,  about 45 minutes. Drain the barley. (The liquid can be reserved to use in  another soup.) Toss the onions into the warm barley to wilt them slightly;  then put the mixture in a soup bowl with the buttermilk. Stir in the  turmeric and herbs and season to taste with additional salt. Cover and  refrigerate until chilled. Serve with freshly ground pepper and paprika or  with a garnish of blossoms, such as chive blossoms, cilantro flowers or  mustard petals.
