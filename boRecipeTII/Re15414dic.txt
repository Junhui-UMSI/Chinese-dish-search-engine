Recipe from Neosoft Recipe Archives Modified by Steve Tanner    Wash and presoak beans overnight.    Put the water, salt and chicken in a large Dutch oven or stock pot. Bring  to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for one hour. Remove from heat, move  chicken to a plate to cool, and skim fat and foam from the broth. Add  beans, onions, garlic, and seasonings to the broth and simmer for 1 hour.  Meanwhile, remove the meat from the chicken, discarding skin, fat, and  bones. Chop the meat into bite-size pieces. After beans have simmered for  an hour, add chicken and green chiles. Continue to simmer until beans are  very tender, but not mushy.    Serve with warm flour tortillas and side dishes of chopped onion,grated  cheddar or Monterey jack cheese, sliced jalapeno chiles, and sour cream.
