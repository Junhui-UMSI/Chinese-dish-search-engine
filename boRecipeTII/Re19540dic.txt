With 2  teaspoons place small heaps on your baking sheet. Let them dry overnight.  Next morning heat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius(!) Bake the cookies for  8-10 minutes.  They should keep their pale colour. Smells great !    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
