Peel, core, and thinly slice the apple. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a  9-inch, cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add apple slices and saute  until wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer slices to a plate. Increase heat to  high, add 1/4 cup sugar to skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until  sugar melts and turns golden, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and  arrange the apple slices in a circular pattern over the bottom. Set skillet  aside.    Chop pecans, toss with 3 tablespoons sugar and the cinnamon, and set aside.  Sift flour with baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside. Beat  remaining butter in a bowl until lightened. Gradually beat in 1 cup sugar,  eggs, one at a time, sour cream, and vanilla. Fold dry ingredients into the  batter.    Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350F. Sprinkle half of  the pecan mixture over the apples. Using your fingers or a spoon,  careflully spread half of the cake batter over pecans. Sprinkle the  remaining pecan mixture over the batter and carefully spread the remaining  cake batter over pecans. Bake the cake until top is golden and a toothpick  inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool on a rack  for 5 minutes. Run a small knife along the edge of the cake and carefully  invert cake onto a serving platter. If apples stick to the skillet, loosen  with a knife and arrange on the cake. Serve slightly warm or at room  temperature. (Can cover and store at room temperature up to 2 days.)    Recipe by Mangia!
