1. Dissolve lemon gelatin in 1-1/4 cups boiling water; cool slightly.  Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, sugar, and lemon juice. Blend mixture into  lemon gelatin. Chill until slightly thickened, about 1 hour - and fold in  apples and pecans.   2. Meanwhile, dissolve orange gelatin in 1 cup boiling water. Add apple  juice. Pour 2/3 cup of liquid into a 6-cup ring mold. Chill until set but  not firm, about 30 minutes. Chill remaining orange gelatin mixture until  slightly thickened.   3. Spoon lemon gelatin mixture over orange gelatin in mold and top with  remaining orange gelatin. Chill until firm - at least 4 hours but overnight  if possible to insure a very firm salad and one that will unmold easily.
