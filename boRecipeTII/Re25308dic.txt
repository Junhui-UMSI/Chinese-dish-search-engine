Torta Caprese
Semisweet chocolate, Stick unsalted butter, All-purpose flour, Walnut pieces, about 5 1/2, Sugar, divided, Eggs, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, setting rack at middle level. Butter a 10-inch  round cake pan, 2 inches deep, and cut a piece of parchment or waxed paper  to fit the bottom.    Cut the chocolate finely and place in a small bowl over hot water to melt,  stirring occasionally. Remove the bowl from the pan and cool slightly.    In a large mixer, beat the butter with half the sugar until soft and light.  Beat in the chocolate, then the yolks, one at a time, scraping bowl and  beaters often. Continue beating until the mixture is smooth and light.  Place the walnuts in the bowl of a food processor and grind them finely,  pulsing the machine on and off at one second intervals. Be careful that the  walnuts do not become pasty. Stir the walnuts into the batter.    In a clean dry bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold a very soft peak  and beat in the remaining sugar in a slow stream. Beat the whites until  they hold a soft glossy peak. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the batter, then  fold in the rest with a rubber spatula, so that no streaks remain.    Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake the Torta  Caprese about 40 minutes, until the center is firm when pressed with a  fingertip.    Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. The cake may sink slightly, though  this does not affect its texture. Trim off any loose crust and invert the  cake on a rack, remove the pan and allow to cool completely. Dust cake with  confectioners sugar and slide onto a platter.
