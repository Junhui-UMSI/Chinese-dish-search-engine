Asparagus with Strawberry Vinaigrette
DRESSING, Strawberry vinegar, Hulled strawberries, Peanut oil, Honey, Walnut oil, Asparagus, 
Trim asparagus and cut each stalk in thirds.  Steam until tender but still  crisp.  (Thin young stalks took 5 minutes.) Plunge in ice water; drain.    Wash strawberries, then hull.  Cut strawberries in half; combine with  asparagus.    Combine dressing ingredients; toss asparagus and strawberries gently with  dressing. Chill well before serving.    The authors write: "What could be simpler - or more delicious - than  springs first asparagus combined with springs first strawberries?"    My notes: Good, and simple.    Tried 02/22/92.
