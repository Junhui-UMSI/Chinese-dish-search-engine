In a large cooking pot brown meat in the butter/marg. Pour off 1/3 cup  liquid from meat and saute green pepper, onion, garlic & parsley in  separate skillet until tender. Add to meat mixture and stir in chili  powder, salt, pepper and cumin.  Add tabasco and tomatoes. Simmer entire  mixture 1 hour covered, remove lid and simmer at least 30 min longer. Stir  occasionally.  Makes 10 servings.   I like it cause its fairly basic  e.g., have added chopped fresh chiles (jalapeno, etc) to it.
