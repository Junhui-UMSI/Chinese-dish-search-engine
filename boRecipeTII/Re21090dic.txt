Two Cheese Ravioli with Quick Tomato Sauce
FOR THE FILLING, Ricotta, fresh herbs, fresh herbs, Parmesan, lemon zest, Egg, Salt, garlic, prosciutto, FOR THE SAUCE, olive oil, Salt, Plum tomatoes, Fresh mozzarella, Crushed red pepper flakes, Won ton wrappers, 
In a bowl combine the grated mozzarella, ricotta, prosciutto, herbs, lemon  zest, egg, salt and pepper. Chill the filling for 1 hour.    In a heavy skillet heat the oil over moderately low heat and cook the  garlic and red pepper flakes,stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes,  bring to a boil and simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, for about 10  minutes or until slightly thickened. Stir in the fresh herbs and season  with salt and pepper. Keep the sauce warm while preparing the ravioli.    Prepare the won ton ravioli: Place 1 won ton wrapper on a lightly floured  surface, mound 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper,  and brush the edges with water. Put a second wrapper over the first,  pressing down around the filling to force out the air, seal the edges well,  and trim the excess dough around the filling with a decorative cutter or  sharp knife. Make won ton ravioli with the remaining wrappers and filling  in the same manner, transferring them as they are formed to a dry kitchen  towel, and turn them occasionally to let them dry slightly.    Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle boil and in it cook the ravioli in  batches for 2 minutes, or until they rise to the surface and are tender.  (Do no let the water boil vigorously once the ravioli have been added.)  Transfer the ravioli as they are cooked with a slotted spoon to paper  towels to drain and keep them warm.    Serve with warm tomato sauce. If desired, garnish with fresh leaves of  basil and freshly grated Parmesan.
