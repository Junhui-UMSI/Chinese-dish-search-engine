Krum Kaker
Eggs, Sugar, Butter, Brandy, Flour, Flour, Potato flour, Cardamom seed, Whipped cream for filling, 
This is a Norwegian waffle cookie and I have watched my mother make these each Christmas for as long as I can remember. The irons, which sit on the top of the burner, can be found in any Scandinavian gift shop. Be sure to buy the wooden cone for rolling them too.   Beat the eggs and stir in the sugar.   Add the remaining ingredients and beat until smooth.    Chill for 1/2 hour before using.      Place the iron on top of a gas flame at medium heat.   Put a tablespoon or so of batter on the hot iron and turn two or three times over the stove until the krum kaker is golden brown.   It is then removed from the iron and rolled on a wooden cone. When cool you will understand why it is called "crumb cookie" in Norwegian. The cones are filled with whipped cream just before serving.
