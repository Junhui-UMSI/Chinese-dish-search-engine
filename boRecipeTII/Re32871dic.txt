Sweet Potatoes Roasted with Rosemary and Garlic
Sweet potatoes, Dried Rosemary, garlic, olive oil, Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, 
Set oven at 375 F.  In a medium bowl, combine the sliced sweet  potatoes with the garlic and oil. Crush the rosemary in your fingers,  and sprinkle it over the potatoes.  Add the salt and pepper. Toss the  potatoes until they are coated with the oil.  In a roasting pan,  spread the potatoes in one layer. Arrange the garlic on top of the  potatoes. This helps avoid their burning as the dish cooks.  Bake 35  to 40 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
