Traditional Christmas Pudding with Brandy Sauce
Wholewheat flour, Ground ginger, Vegetable suet, juice and rind of 1 lemon, Sultanas, almonds, candied peel, Salt, nutmeg, Brown sugar, Molasses, Water & rum, Mixed spice, Wholewheat breadcrumbs, Currants, Raisins, 
Grease a 2 pint pudding basin & use a large saucepan to hold the basin.    Wash currants, sultanas & raisins in warm water & pat dry.  Put fruit in  large bowl with candied peel & almonds.  Sift flour, salt & spices into  bowl & add sugar, breadcrumbs & suet.  Mix well then stir in lemon juice,  rind & molasses with enough of the water & rum mixture to make a soft  mixture.  Turn into the basin, cover with waxed paper & aluminum foil & put  basin into pot.  Pour enough water into the pot to reach halfway up the  side of the basin.  Bring to a boil, cover saucepan & let pudding steam  gently for 4 hours, watching the water level & topping up with boiling  water if necessary.    When cooked, cool the pudding & store in a cool dry place for up to 2  months.  Before serving, steam pudding agin for 3 hours.  Turn out onto a  serving platter & flame with brandy if you desire.    **NOTE I divide the pudding in half & make 2 smaller puddings.  Keeps up to        3    months in the fridge.
