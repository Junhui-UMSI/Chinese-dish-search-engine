1. Dissolve sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup of the extra warm water. Set aside.    2. Meal the salt, vital wheat gluten, and shortening into the flour.    3. Add the remaining 2 cups of extra warm water to flour. Stir.    4. Add yeast mixture.    5. Kneed until all flour is blended and dough is elastic. More flour can be  added if dough is too sticky. (You can kneed for awhile, let set for about  5 minutes and then come back to it. This makes it easier to kneed without  incorporating more flour)    6. Let rise for 1 1/2 hours, punching down as needed.    7. Separate dough into two parts. Form into loaf size. Place in 2 greased  loaf tins.    8. Let rise in tins until double. Bake at 350 F for 40 minutes.    NOTES : This recipe will make approximately 15 buns.  Divide dough into 15  parts.  Roll into balls.  Place in a 9 x 13 greased bake pan with tops down  to coat with some of the shortening.  Turn dough back right side up. Let  rise until double and bake in 350 F oven for 25-30 minutes.  For persons  living at a lower altitude, increase the amount of yeast to 2 tablespoons  (2 packages).  Recipe by: Iris Dunaway    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #388 by hister@juno.com (Iris E.
