Ham and Veggie Noodle Casserole
Cooked ham, diced, Frozen Mixed Veggies, cooked, Short pasta (fusilli or, Cream of Mushroom soup **, 
* Or use your own steamed fresh veggies.  Much better! ** I like the  Campbells 98%FF version so I think Ill use it from now-on.    Combine all ingredients and pour into 9x13 dish.  Bake at 350 until done. I  always made a double batch and it freezes very well.  Freeze in  portion-sized cubes, then you just have to grab a block out of the freezer  on your way to work.
