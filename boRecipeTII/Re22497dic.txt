Applesauce Maple Muffins
Maple syrup, Dark raisins or chopped, Egg whites, Whole Wheat hour, Unsweetened applesauce, Baking Powder, 
Combine the flour and baking powder, and stir to mix well. Add the  applesauce, maple syrup, and egg whites, and stir just until the dry  ingredients are moistened. Fold in the raisins or walnuts.    Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray, and fill 3/4 full with the  batter. Bake at 350F for 16 to 18 minutes, or just until a wooden toothpick  inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.    Remove the muffin tin from the oven, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes  before removing the muffins. Serve warm or at room temperature.
