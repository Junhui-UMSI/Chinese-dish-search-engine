If you want to make lamb stock, substitute lamb bones for the veal and beef  bones and continue with the recipe.    1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.    2. Arrange the bones in a roasting pan, large enough to hold them in a  single layer. Roast in the oven until dark golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours,  turning to brown all sides. After one hour, add the remaining ingredients  to brown. Transfer the bones and vegetables to a large stockpot, 10- to  12-quarts.    3. Pour off the fat from the roasting pan and deglaze the pan with 2 cups  of water, scraping up any particles that stick to the bottom of the pan.  Pour into the stockpot with enough additional water to cover the  ingredients by 3 inches. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat, and  simmer, uncovered, 4 to 6 hours, skimming the foam as it accumulates on  top, and adding water as needed to keep the bones and vegetables covered at  all times.    4. Strain the liquid into a clean pot, pressing down to extract all the  juices. Reduce, over medium heat, until 2 quarts remain.    5. Cool and refrigerate in a covered container up to 3 days, discarding any  hardened layer of fat before using or freezing.    Makes 2 quarts.    To prepare ahead: Through step 5. The stock can be frozen in small  quantities and used as needed.    Note: To make demi-glace, in step 4 reduce the liquid until 1 quart  remains.
