Preheat oven to 325 F for Giant cookies, 350 F for regular cookies.  Grease a cookie sheet.    2. Cream margarine and sucanat together until light and fluffy. Add eggs  and vanilla and mix well.    3. sift dry ingredients together and stir in, mixing throughly. Add  chocolate chips to batter.    4. Bake on the prepared cookie sheet on the middle rack for 15-17 minutes  for Giant cookies, 8-10 minutes for regular cookies. Remove from oven while  cookies are slightly soft. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before  transferring cookies to a rack to cool completely. Variations: - Add 1 cup  chopped walnuts, or peacans, or coconut - Substitute 1 teaspoon mint  extract for vanilla extract    And my own variation, in which I indulged just yesterday (naughty me!):  melt half a cup of chocolate chips and stir into batter to make double-  chocolate cookie dough! (A good way to get rid of that extra half cup of  chips, if you use a regular 12 oz. bag instead of what Barat provides --  yeah, right, call it thrift instead of sinful indulgence  :-)    Attention: All ye folks who have loved the taste of raw cookie batter for  years, but have been afraid to indulge from fear of bateria in raw eggs  (salamonea or however ye spell it): please note that vegan cookies, having  no eggs, is SAFE TO EAT RAW! So go right on ahead and make that batter to  eat straight from the bowl  :-).    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
