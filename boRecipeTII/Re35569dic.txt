Grease 8" square cake pan, 9" pie plate or springform pan.    Beat egg white in a small bowl and set aside.  In large bowl, cream  together margarine, sugar and egg yolk until fluffy. Combine flour and  baking powder, beat into egg mixture alternately with milk. Fold beaten egg  white into batter.    Turn into prepared pan.  Halve plums (or slice peach, apple, pear,  nectarine) and arrange over top.    Streusel topping:  in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine and  cinnamon.  Mix well and sprinkle over fruit.    Bake at 350 F for about 35 minutes or until top is golden and toothpick  inserted into cake comes out clean. Time depends on thickness of batter.    Glaze:  Combine icing sugar, milk and vanilla.  Mix well. Drizzle over  cake.    My notes:  original recipe halved makes 5 servings, but it tasted so good  warm that we only cut 4 servings. Warmed up in microwave for the second  meal. Use extra fruit (fresh or canned) to make 6 servings. Would be nice  served at a brunch - moist but not too sweet. Tested with fresh nectarines!    1/5 recipe, one serving 288 calories, 8 g fat, 56 mg cholesterol, 109 mg  sodium, 4 g protein, 50 g carbohydrate    Source:  The Lighthearted Cookbook by Anne Lindsay, Heart and Stroke  Foundation of Ontario 1988.
