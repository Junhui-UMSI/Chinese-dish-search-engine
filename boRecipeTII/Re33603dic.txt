Soak the bread crumbs in the milk for several minutes. Meanwhile, combine  the ground turkey and ground beef. Beat the whole eggs and egg whites  together and add to the meat mixture. Add the moistened bread crumbs,  onion, and seasonings to the meat mixture and mix well. Form into 1  1/2-inch balls (makes 40-50) and refrigerate overnight. Line up the  meatballs on a large pan-like cookie sheet (with edges) and bake at 350F  for 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through cooking time. While meatballs  are cooking, heat stock in a large pot. Gradually add the flour, stirring  constantly. Cook and stir until slightly thickened. Stir in the instant  coffee.  Remove the meatballs from the oven and transfer them to the beef  stock using a slotted spoon to allow grease to drain away. Simmer for 45  minutes and serve. Makes 10 servings of 4 meatballs each.
