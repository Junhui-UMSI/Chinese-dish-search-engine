Potato Pancakes
Text, 
Heres another potato pancake tip.  Take cold mashed potatoes,  (instant are fine) and toss in a couple of eggs.  Whip it good.  Brown a couple of tablespoons of dehydrated onion flakes in a skillet  and mix them in too. Plop the mess down on a griddle, brown both  sides and enjoy!
