Brining a Chicken
Water, Kosher salt, Molasses*, Sugar, Pepper, Thyme, Oregano, 
* I used sulphured, but I also saw there was an unsulphured in the store.  Other than a stronger flavor, is there any other impact?    Anyways, I finally got around to brining a chicken. Did it last Sunday, and  you guys are right. Moistest bird I ever ate. Anna says its a keeper. She  says its better than the beer butt chicken I often do. The recipe I used  was posted here before:    Soaked it 24 hours. Put a plastic bowl on top to force it under. Rinsed it  well, put it on the ECB for 3+ hours using lump and oak and hickory chunks.    Posted to bbq-digest by "James A. Moore" <jmoore@smtpgate.read.tasc.com> on  Aug 12, 1998,
