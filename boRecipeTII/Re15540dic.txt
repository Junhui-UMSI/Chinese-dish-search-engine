Beat 30  seconds at low speed of electric mixer. Place over boiling water.    Cook, beating constantly, until stiff peaks form (about 7 minutes). Dont  overcook. Remove from boiling water. Add vanilla, beat until spreading  consistency, about 2 minutes. Frosts 2 8- or 9-inch cake layers.    Chocolate option: fold in 2 ounces melted and cooled unsweetened chocolate,  just before frosting cake.    Alternately, one could also substitute pareve margarine for the butter in a  buttercream, but I dont know how that affects the taste.
