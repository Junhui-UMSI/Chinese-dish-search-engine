Add the figs and cook on a low flame until the fruit is soft (about 15  minutes).    4. Remove just the fruit and place in a canning jar, if available. If not a  regular jar is fine.    5. If the mixture is thin, boil until it thickens. Pour over the figs in  the jar and seal tightly.    6. If it is not hermetically sealed (as in a canning jar), then  refrigerate. Allow for at least a week to pass for optimum taste.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest by Linda Shapiro <lss@coconet.com> on Feb 7,  1998
