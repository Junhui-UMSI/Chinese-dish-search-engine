1. Sprinkle pork chops with pepper. Heat oil in large skillet and cook  chops over medium heat until lightly browned on both sides, about 6  minutes. Reduce heat, add chopped onion to pan and continue cooking 8 to 10  minutes.   2. Meanwhile, in a separate pan combine the apple juice concentrate, brown  sugar, washed cranberries, the chopped apple, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Cook over medium low heat until cranberries burst and sauce thickens  slightly, about 4 minutes.   3. Remove accumulated fat from chops. Pour sauce over meat and stir into  onions in pan. Cover and cook over low heat until chops are done, 5 to 8  minutes. Serve immediately with rice or boiled potatoes.    Miscellaneous recipes from the collection of Mike Orchekowski.
