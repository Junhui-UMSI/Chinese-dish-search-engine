Almond and Rice Flour Bread with Poppy Seeds
Whole almonds; with skins, Salt, Egg; Whole, Vegetable oil, Water, Brown rice flour, Plain low-fat yogurt, Egg white, Baking Powder, Poppy seeds, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.    Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and  grind until a fine meal is formed--the flour will prevent the nuts from  turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt and 2  teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.    Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2- cup measuring  cup.    With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed tube  over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix.    Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds, and  bake for 55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices best after  several hours, or the next day).    Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).
