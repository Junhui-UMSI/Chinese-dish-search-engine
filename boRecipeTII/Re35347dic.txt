In a small bowl, combine the bulgur with  1/2 cup warm water; let stand for  30 min, or until the bulgur is tender and the water is absorbed.    In a large non-stick skillet, heat oil over low heat. Add onions and sugar;  saute until the onions are tender and dark golden, about 15 min. Stir in  1/4 cup water and vinegar. Season with salt and keep warm.    Prepare the grill or preheat the broiler. In a medium bowl, combine the  bulgur, beef, tomato paste, parsley, 1/2 tsp salt and pepper; mix  thoroughly but lightly. Shape into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Grill over  high heat or broil on a lightly oiled rack until browned and cooked  through, about 5 min per side. Blot the patties with paper towels. Place  each patty on a bun, top with the caramelized onions and garnish with  lettuce.    eating Well Recipe Rescue Cookbook ISBN 1-884943-01-2 pg 149
