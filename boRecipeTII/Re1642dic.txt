These tiny Bavarian-style noodles are ready to serve in the time it takes  to make rice...and kids love em!    Note 1: Original recipe used 2 cans (14 1/2 oz each) no-fat chicken broth    Note 2: Original recipe used 1 Tbsp butter    In pot combine broth with 5 C water; over high heat bring to a boil.    Meanwhile, in skillet melt margarine (or butter) over medium heat. Add  onion; cook until softened slightly and lightly browned, 3 - 5 min. Remove  from heat; set aside.    Combine flour, baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt and nutmeg. In bowl lightly beat  egg and egg white with milk and 1/2 C water. Stir in flour mixture until  combined. Spoon into colander over pot of simmering broth mixture. [NOTE:  The batter is very thick. You need a colander with moderately large holes.  We ended up using a potato masher and pushing it thru with our fingers. The  holes were a bit large but it tasted good anyway. We had to adjust the  cooking time for this method by allowing them to cook 1 - 2 min each  batch.] With spatula press some of batter through holes. Cook until  spaetzel float, about 1 min. Remove with slotted spoon, allowing excess  liquid to drip off; transfer to serving bowl. Repeat cooking remaining  batter; drain and transfer to bowl. Stir parsley, pepper, reserved onion  and remaining salt into spaetzle.    This is wonderful tasting and quick to make.
