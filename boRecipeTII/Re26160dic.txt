Toll House Cookies (Original!)
Butter, Water, Eggs, Flour; all-purpose, Salt, Baking soda, Vanilla extract, Walnuts, Brown sugar, Sugar, Semisweet chocolate chips, 
Cream butter. Add Brown and White Sugar and eggs. Dissolve soda in hot  water. Add alternately with flour sifted with salt. Add nuts, chocolate  chips and vanilla.    Drop by half teaspoonfuls onto greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375? for 10 to  12 minutes. Makes about 100 cookies.    NOTES : The following is a quote from Ruth Graves Wakefields "Toll House  Recipes, Tried and True": "At Toll House, we chill dough overnight. When  mixture is ready for baking, we roll a teaspoon of dough between palms of  hands and  place balls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheet. Then we  press balls with finger tips to form flat rounds. This way the cookies do  not spread as much in the baking and they keep uniformly round. They should  be brown through, and crispy, not white and hard as I have sometimes seen  them."
