The original recipe calls for hibiscus flowers and suggested strawberries  as a substitute. I have reversed the order. As well, I dont think it is  necessary to use distilled water in most locations. In medium saucepan,  combine 2 1/2 cups water, sugar and hibiscus flowers (or hulled  strawberries). Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat.  Simmer 5 minutes to extract pink to extract pink from flowers. Remove from  heat. Stir in lavender leaves. Cover and cool. Strain cooled herb liquid  into large pitcher or jar (if using strawberries, gently press juice from  berries.) Add remaining 2 1/2 cups water and lemon juice. Stir well. Add  1/2 cup more sugar, if desired. Just before serving, add ice cubes. Pour  into chilled glasses.Garnish with lavender flowers. YIELD: 6-8 Servings
