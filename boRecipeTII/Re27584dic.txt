The Best Buttermilk Waffles
Salt, Egg, All-purpose flour, Baking soda, Cornmeal, Buttermilk, Unsalted butter, 
Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Whisk  yolk with buttermilk and butter. Beat egg white until it just holds a  2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin steady  stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be careful not to add  liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward end of mixing, use a  folding motion to incorporate ingredients; gently fold egg white into  batter. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto waffle iron. Following  manufacturers instructions, cook waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5  minutes. Serve immediately. (You can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a  200-degree oven for up to 5 minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. (I rarely have  buttermilk in the house, but I always have buttermilk *powder*. I  substitute 1/4 cup buttermilk powder + 7/8 cup water for the buttermilk in  this recipe. I add the buttermilk powder to the dry ingredients, and I add  the water to the wet ingredients. The flavor is great! I do NOT use the  cornmeal. Sometimes I add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla  extract, but the sugar makes the waffles brown more quickly. I usually  double or triple the recipe. If you dont have buttermilk or buttermilk  powder, use the recipe for "Almost-as-Good-as-Buttermilk Waffles" instead.  ~jlw) NOTES : "The secret to great waffles is a thick batter, so dont  expect to pour this one. Make toaster waffles out of leftover batter --  undercook the waffles a bit, cool them on a wire rack, wrap them in plastic  wrap and freeze. Pop them in the toaster for a quick breakfast." --  Christopher Kimball, Cooks Illustrated magazine.
