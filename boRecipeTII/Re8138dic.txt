light crust setting. delayed timer ok    My adaptation, loosely based on a potato bread recipe in Bread Machine  Magic. The garlic and chives can be changed to any dried herbs you want.    Ive found this could work well as mixes. Ill be packaging the dry  ingredients in zip-lock bags, labeling with instructions to add water,  oil/butter/ and yeast, and giving them as gifts to friends and relative who  own bread machines.    >From: Sandal@aol.com  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Bread Machine Magic
