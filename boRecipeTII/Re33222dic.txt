Basic Pilaf
Salt; optional, Hot Chicken Or Beef Broth;, Olive Oil Or Butter, Uncooked Rice, 
Saute rice, stirring constantly, in hot oil or butter in nonstick pan until  translucent, about 2 minutes. Combine rice and broth in steaming pan;  season to taste. Cover and steam until the rice is done, 18 to 20 minutes.  Uncover and allow to dry out, 3 to 5 minutes. Fluff with fork before  serving.    Variations: * Soak rice in hot water; allow to cool; drain and proceed with  recipe. Turkish cooks consider this step necessary for a fluffier rice.    * Although not typical, pilaf may be flavored with onion and garlic.    * Pilaf may be sprinkled with finely chopped parsley or paprika to taste  just before serving.    * Like their neighbors in Italy, Greeks love tomatoes so they can sometimes  add the flavor to pilaf. Saute 1/2 cup finely chopped onion in oil. Add 1/2  cup finely chopped tomato or tomato sauce to rice and broth in steaming  pan. Onion may be omitted.
