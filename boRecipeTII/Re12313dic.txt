Zucchini Pizza
Flour, Oregano, Grated Parmesan, olive oil, Eggs, Salt, Zucchini, Pepper, Tomato sauce, 
Pizza toppings: mushrooms, Mozzarella, etc.    Grate zucchini and sprinkle with salt.  Let stand for 30 minutes. Squeeze  out water from zucchini.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 pan.    Combine zucchini, eggs, flour, Parmesan cheese, oregano and a few grinds of  pepper. Spread mixture onto pan. Bake 25-30 minutes or until firm and dry.  Brush with oil and broil until lightly browned. Spread with tomato sauce.  Add mushrooms and Mozzarella cheese on top. Broil again until Mozzarella is  melted and bubbly.    Notes:  Can also be made in a jelly roll pan I prefer just mushrooms on  top, too many extras dont enhance IMHO You could probably use a mixture of  Romano and Parmesean...
