This rich, smoky-flavored puree makes an excellent spread for pita bread,  chewy country-style bread and sesame crackers, as well as a tasty dip for  raw vegetables. It can also be served as an accompaniment to grilled  chicken, fish and red meats.    1. Sprinkle both sides of eggplant slices with salt. Place eggplant in a  colander and let drain 30 minutes.    2. Rinse eggplant well, and pat dry with paper towels. Brush both sides of  each slice lightly with olive oil.    3. Grill eggplant (in 2 batches, if necessary) over medium heat for about  15 minutes, turning the slices once, until eggplant is cooked but not too  charred.    4. Remove eggplant from grill. When cool enough to handle, pull off charred  peel around each slice. (Discard peel -- or eat it right then as a snack!)    5. Combine grilled eggplant with onion, garlic, lemon juice, oregano, salt  and pepper in a food processor. Process until mixture is fairly smooth.    6. With processor still running, add olive oil in a thin, steady stream.  Continue processing until all oil has been absorbed and mixture forms a  thick paste. (It will thicken more when chilled.)    7. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley  just before serving.    Heat Scale: Mild    This puree is best when made 1 day in advance, to allow the flavors to  ripen and meld.    Recipe by: Chile Pepper Magazine, August 1998
