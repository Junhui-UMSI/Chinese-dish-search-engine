It may be round or oval shaped.    Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water.  Add sugar and set aside for 10  minutes. Pour yeast mixture in large bowl or food processor, add 2 cups  warm water, and salt--mix well. Gradually add flour while stirring  constantly.  After 6 cups flour have been added, knead by hand, add the  rest of the flour if needed until the dough is not sticky.    Pour oil in a large bowl and place dough in bowl.  Cover with a clean damp  towel and let rise 4 hours in warm dark place without moving.  Punch air  out while dough is in the bowl. Flip dough over and return to bowl. Cover  with new damp towel and allow to rise 2 hours.    Place cookie sheet in center of oven and preheat to 500 degrees F.  Divide  dough into 11 parts, each piece about 5 inches in diameter.  Dust a tray  with corn meal and place loaves on tray. With damp hands, press fingertips  into each loaf, then sprinkle tops with sesame seeds.    Put loaves on the cookie sheet, corn meal side down, and bake sesame side  for 8 miuntes in closed oven.  Turn bread over and bake corn meal side down  for 4 minutes in closed oven.  Remove loaves from oven. Cover with clean  towel, serve hot or wrap in foil and freeze(toast before serving.)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
