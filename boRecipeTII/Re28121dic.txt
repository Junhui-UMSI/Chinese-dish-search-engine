Baked Couscous with Spinach and Pine Nuts
Garlic, Fresh spinach, Tomatoes, Pine nuts, Onion, Meunster cheese, Couscous, Salt, olive oil, Ground black pepper, Boiling stock, Fresh basil, 
Combine couscous, boiling liquid, and salt in a large bowl and cover with a  plate. Let sit for 5 min. then fluff with fork. Heat the oil in a large  skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic and onion 10 mins. or until  tender. Add drained tomatoes and cook 10 mins. more, stirring frequently.  Stir tomato mixture into couscous and mix in reserved tomato juice, basil,  pine nuts, spinach, and pepper. Spread half the couscous mixture into a  12x7x2 in. or other shallow (2.5 qt) baking pan. Sprinkle on cheese, then  top with remaining couscous. Cover with foil and bake at 375 F for 25 min.  or until hot and bubbly.  NOTES : this could easily be made with less oil (just enough to keep       onions from sticking), little or not salt (Id prefer soy sauce       anyway for       flavor), and the cheese could be left out for a vegan or pareve       meal.
