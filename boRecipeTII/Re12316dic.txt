*Or use canned plum tomatoes.    Scrub zucchini well under running cold water.  Cut off ends and cut into  1/4" slices.  Sprinkle with salt, toss to coat and let stand in a colander  for 30 minutes. Rinse well in cold water, then place in a cloth towel and  squeeze out bitter juices.  Dry well.    Heat half the oil in a large, heavy skillet and lightly saute zucchini.  Remove zucchini from pan and set aside. Discard used oil. Add remaining  oil; heat. Add onions and gently cook, covered, over low heat ("sweat" the  onions), just to soften.  Remove lid. Turn heat to medium and add garlic.  Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes. Add fresh herbs and wine and the  reserved, sauteed zucchini.  Cook 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Season with salt and pepper. Zucchini should still have some crunch to it.    To vary this, add sliced, seeded green or red peppers with the onions to  soften, and proceed as above.    Serve warm as a side dish or cold as a salad.  Use small zucchini for the  sweetest flavor.    From _Nancy Enrights Canadian Herb Cookbook_ by Nancy Enright. Toronto:  James Lorimer & Company, 1985.
