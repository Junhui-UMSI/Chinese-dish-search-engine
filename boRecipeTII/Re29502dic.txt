Tarragon Poached Fish
Black pepper, Margarine, Lemon wedges, Fish fillets -- * see note, Green Onions, Tarragon, Chicken broth -- low sodium, Salt -- to taste, 
* Use fresh fish fillets or steaks. If using frozen, allow extra cooking  time.    Rinse fish and pat dry. In large heavy skillet, melt margarine over medium  heat (use olive oil instead of margarine if desired). Add chopped onions  and tarragon leaves. Cook until onions are limp; about 3 minutes. Add broth  and bring to a boil. Place fish in single layer in this mixture. Reduce  heat, cover, and simmer until just translucent. Do not overcook.    * Approximate cooking time: if using fresh fillets about 3/4 inch thick,  will take about 6 minutes, 1-1/2 inch thick will take about 12 minutes.  Carefully remove fish from pan, place on serving plate and keep warm. Turn  heat to high and allow the juices in pan to cook until reduced to about one  half. Pour juice over fish and immediately serve with lemon wedges, salt  and pepper if desired.
