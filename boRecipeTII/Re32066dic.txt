Wash chicken and pat dry.  Heat oil in saucepan.  Add onion and garlic and  saute for 5 minutes. Add remaining ingredients except chicken. Simmer 20-30  minutes. Strain and set aside to cool. With a sharp knife, make small cuts  in chicken pieces.  Spoon cooled barbecue sauce over chicken and let stand  for at least 1/2 hour. Heat broiler or grill. Cook about 30-45 minutes,  depending on size of chicken pieces. Baste frequently with barbecue sauce.  Test for doneness by pricking chicken with skewer; if juice runs clear,  chicken is done.  Heat remaining sauce and serve separately.    Creative Cooking:  Poultry, typed by Carolyn Shaw 1-95    From the database of Judi M.
