Knead all ingredients together except for 1 small pkg. jello and  refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.  Mold into shape of strawberry. Roll  in third package of jello. Make 2 leaves on top using icing in a can with  tips or make buttercream icing and use #67 leaf tip. Refrigerate. Makes 80  ~ 90.    NOTE:  I buy a 14. oz. bag of flaked coconut and grind finely in a food  processor.
