Mill the popped popcorn. 8 cups  of popped popcorn will yield 4 cups of fluffy popcorn flour. Put  ingredients in breadpan in order given. Set for rapid bake. The resulting  loaf is high and light--the texture almost of "Wonder Bread" but much more  flavorful. I milled the popcorn in my electic Miracle Mill but the hand  mills should work fine,too. Popcorn must be compressed a bit as its  entering the mill and a wooden lemon reamer works well as a "stuffer". Do  NOT attempt to mill unpopped popcorn in your electric mill. I can only  break those hard kernels with my Back to Basics hand mill. The extra  popcorn flour can be frozen in a ziploc and stored for future loaves. The  fragrance is wonderful!
