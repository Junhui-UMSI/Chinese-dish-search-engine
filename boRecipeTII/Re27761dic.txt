Combine first set of ingredients, except flour, in a large, heavy saucepan.  Place over medium-high heat and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often. Add  flour and stirwell to combine with vegetables. Add sauce ingredients and  stir very well. Bring to a simmer, while stirring frequently. Let cook for  10 minutes after coming to a simmer.    Place 10 ounces of filling in each of six individual baking dishes. Set  aside to cool slightly. Place prepared pie crust over tops of cooled  filling and crimp around the edges to seal. Cut three small slits into the  top to let steam escape while baking. When pies are prepared, place in a  preheated 375 degree oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until crust is  browned. Serve immediately or cool, then reheat in a 350 degree oven for 15  to 20 minutes until hot. While reheating, you may need to cover loosely  with foil to prevent burning the crust. Makes 6 servings.    ~-From the National Onion Association    Posted to recipelu-digest by P&S Gruenwald <sitm@ne.infi.net> on Feb 20,  1998
