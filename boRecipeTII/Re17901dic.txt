For the dough, combine dry ingredients in food processor and pulse to mix.  Add butter and pulse in. Add egg and continue to pulse until dough forms a  ball. Roll the dough into a 14-inch disk and line a 10-inch tart pan. Chill  the dough several hours, or overnight.    Peel, core, halve and slice the apples 1/8-inch thick; arrange on pastry,  overlapping. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. For custard, combine all  ingredients; whisk by hand until smooth and well blended; strain and  reserve.    Bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes or until apples and crust are  baked through. Remove tart from oven; pour on custard cream, being careful  not to let it overflow. Return tart to oven for 5 to 10 minutes or until  custard is set, but not colored or puffed.
