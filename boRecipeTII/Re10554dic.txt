Rinse chicken pieces, pat dry and place in a large plastic bag. Place  marinade ingredients in a jar, cover and shake well (yes, it is ugly!) Pour  marinade over chicken, squeeze out air and seal bag. Rotate several times  to coat chicken.  Marinade in refrigerator 1 hour to overnight. Remove  chicken, saving excess marinade. Grill over hot coals or 6-7 inches from  oven broiler until done (30-45 min.) , basting several times with reserved  marinade.
