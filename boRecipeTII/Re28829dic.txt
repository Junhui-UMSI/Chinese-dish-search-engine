Scale and clean fish, then rinse with cold water. Pat dry with paper  towels. Make diagonal slashes (almost to the bone) 2 inches apart on both  sides of fish. Set fish on a heat-proof plate that is at least 1 inch  smaller in diameter than your wok .  Mix together chiles, garlic, fish  sauce, lime juice and chicken stock. Adjust for a predominantly sour taste.  Pour over fish. Scatter green onions and lemon grass over fish. Fill wok  with 2 inches of boiling water.  When it comes to a full boil, set fish  plate on rack or trivet. Cover tightly. Reduce heat to medium-high and  steam for 12 minutes. If meat by the bone is opaque white, fish is done.  Garnish fish with cilantro and serve with cooking juices. Accompany with  steamed rice. Serves 4 wi th other entrees.
