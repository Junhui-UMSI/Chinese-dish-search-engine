Notes: From Kathy Bless, Fayetteville, PA. COUNTRY MAGAZINE.    In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast and flour: add butter and mix well. Add  egg yolks and sour cream: mix well. Shape into four balls. Place in    separate resealable plastic bags or wrap in plastic wrap: refrigerate  overnight. In a small bowl, combine sugar, pecans and cinnamon: set aside.  On a floured surface, roll each ball of dough into a 9-inch circle.  Sprinkle    with sugar mixture and apple. Cut each circle into 16 wedges: roll up from  wide edge and pinch to seal. Place with point side down on greased baking  sheets. Bake at 350 degrees for 16-20 minutes or until lightly browned.  Immediately remove to wire racks to cool. For icing, combine sugar, milk  and vanilla until smooth: drizzle over the twists. Sprinkle with pecans.  Yield: 64 twists. EDITORS NOTE: The yeast does not need to be dissolved in  liquid, and no rising time is necessary before baking.    "This recipe has been one of my favorites for years.
