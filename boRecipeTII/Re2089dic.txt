Source:The Cooking of the British Isles - Time/Life    In a heavy 6 to 8 quart enameled or stainless-steel pot, combine all  ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally, then  reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until most of  the liquid has cooked away and the mixture is thick enough to hold its  shape in a spoon. Stir it frequently as it begins to thicken, to prevent  the chutney from sticking to the sides and bottom.    Remove the pot from the heat. With a large spoon, ladle the chutney  immediately into hot sterilized jars, filling them to within 1/4 inch of  the top and process in boiling water bath 10 minutes for pints and quarts.  << Joyce Monschein >>    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 26, 98
