Porkchop Delight
Cream of Mushroom Soup, Onion Soup Mix, milk, White rice, Salt & Pepper, Pork Chops, Whole Mushrooms, 
saute the Pork Chops in a very hot frying pan to seal in the juices and  partially cook.    Mix the Cream of Mushroom soup, mushrooms, powdered Onion Soup Mix, milk,  and uncooked grains of rice together in a bowl. Pour about half of this  mixture into a casserole dish. Lay the pork chops on top of it. Cover them  with the other half of the mixture.    Bake on a 250 degree oven for approximately two hours. Check for doneness.  Remove from oven, and serve. (The rice should be cooked and the pork chops  will be very tender.)    Posted to EAT-L Digest 07 Feb 97 by Ken Quann & Jane Lockhart  <kenquann@ESCAPE.CA> on Feb 8, 1997.
