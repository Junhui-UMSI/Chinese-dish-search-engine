Place a pizza stone, baking tiles or an inverted baking sheet on the bottom  or on the lowest rack of a cold oven; preheat for 30 minutes to 500 degrees  F or the highest setting.    Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a disk. Use a rolling  pin or your hands to roll or stretch the dough into a circle that is 1/4  inch thick and 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Tranfer to a semolina or  cornmeal dusted pizza peel or inverted baking sheet.    Brush the dough with a little of the olive oil to the edge. Spread tomato  sauce over the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Distribute mozzarella  slices over the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Arrange basil  leaves over the mozzarella, reserving a few for garnish if you wish.  Sprinkle with Parmesan. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Carefully  slide the pizza onto the heated pizza stone and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or  until the bottom is crisp and browned and the top is bubbling. Garnish with  the reserved basil leaves, if desired.    Entered by: Diane Pahl (1:2410/120) Recipes from: Eating Well, The Magazine  of Food and Health (tm) ISSN 1064-16399
