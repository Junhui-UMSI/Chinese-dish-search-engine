Drain and  cool. Chop pickle. Dice tomatoes. Mix all in a large bowl. For the sauce  mix the mayonnaise and yoghurt. Add some vinegar (I used some from the  pickles) so make a creamy, quite liquid sauce. If this is to sour for you,  use milk instead, or if it is too mild use proper vinegar. Mix well, add  herbs and season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over potatoes, turn over  gently, and leave to stand for a while before serving (its even better the  next day!)    Delicious for barbecues!    EAT-L Digest 28 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
