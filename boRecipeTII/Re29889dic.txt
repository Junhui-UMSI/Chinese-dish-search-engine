Powdered sugar, divided, Whipped topping, Egg white, room temperature, White vinegar, Granulated sugar, Fresh strawberries or kiwi, Vanilla extract, Serving Non-stick Spray(Pam), 
Use a shallow rectangular baking dish, approximately 6 by 8 inches. Spray  with non-stick butter flavored cooking spray. Line with wax paper cut to  fit.  Spray again with Pam, dust lightly with 1/2 of the powdered sugar.  Set aside.  Whip egg white until firm peaks form. Add sugar, vinegar and  vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form, about 30 seconds to 1 minute more.  Spread evenly in baking dish, and cook in microwave oven for 1 1/2 to 2  minutes on high. The meringue will stretch and spread while baking, but  will shrink back to proper size while cooling, so dont panic! Cool  meringue, and turn out onto wax paper that has been lightly dusted with the  remaining powdered sugar. Spread with the tablespoon of whipped topping,  top with the fruit and gently roll up. Garnish with small piece of fruit  and mint leaves.
