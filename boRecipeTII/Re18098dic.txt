Have tortillas on a flat surface for filling.    Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large skillet. Cook 1 cup onions and 1 clove  garlic until soft.    Add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, Tabasco sauce, chili powder, maple  syrup, dash salt and cumin. Cook and stir until well mixed and heated  through.    Heat remaining oil in another skillet; cook and stir pinto beans, 1 clove  garlic and 1/2 cup onion into oil. Add olives, dash salt, 1 tsp chili  powder. Add some of the sauce mixture if beans are too thick.    Assemble echiladas by filling tortillas with 2-3 tbs bean mixture. Place  mixture on one edge of tortilla, not in center. (It is easier to roll up.)  Roll up tortillas; place in shallow baking dish; cover with sauce.    Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until bubbly.    Optional: Dot with cheesy sauce made with nutritional yeast.
