Pus Pockets
Pitas, Ketchup, Mozzarella cheese; shredded, 
Recipe by: Creepy Cuisine, Lucy Munroe       Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Slit open each pita along 1/4 of its  edge to make a pocket, and spoon 1/2 cup shredded cheese into each one.  Place the stuffed pitas on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes,  or until the pitas turn golden brown. Remove from the oven. With a knife,  poke a hole in the top of each pita. Carefully squeeze pitas, theyll be  hot, until a little melted cheese oozes out of the hole. Dab ketchup around  the hole and arrange on a platter. Now you can not only pick your pimples,  but you can eat them too! Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
