Here  come some candy yummies.    contributed by Mrs Charles W McNamara    Combine first 6 ingredients in a buttered 3-quart heavy sauce pan. Bring  mixture to boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly. Cook without  stirring until candy reaches 230 on candy thermometer or until it makes a  soft ball when tested in cold water. Remove from heat. Add margarine and  vanilla; do not stir. Cool without stirring until outside of pan becomes  lukewarm. Stir in nuts and beat until candy loses gloss. Pour into 3 dozen  bonbon cups.
