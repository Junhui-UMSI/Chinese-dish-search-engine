Tomato Olive Spirals
Egg, 8 oz pkg cream cheese;, Water, Egg yolk; slightly beaten, Dried oregano or thyme;, 16 oz pkg hot roll mix, 3 oz pkg cream cheese;, Green onion; chopped, Ripe olives, pitted; finely, Cracked black pepper, Oil packed dried tomatoes, 
Prepare hot roll mix according to the package directions.  After kneading  the dough, divide it into thirds. Cover the dough loosely and let rest for        5    minutes.    Meanwhile, for the filing, drain the tomatoes, reserving the oil.  Chop the  tomatoes.  In a medium mixing bowl combine the chopped tomatoes, cream  cheese, olives, green onions, egg yolk, pepper and oregano or thyme.  If  necessary, stir in enough of the reserved tomato oil (about 1 tablespoon)  to make a filling of spreading consistency.    On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of the dough to a 14" x 11"  rectangle.  Spread a third of the filling on each rectangle to within 1/2"  of the edges. (The filling amount will seem generous.) Roll up each  rectangle tightly from a long side. Seat seams. Place, seam side down, on a  greased large baking sheet. Cover and let rise until nearly double, about  30 to 40 minutes.    Slash the loaf tops with 3 or 4 diagonal cuts, about 1/4" deep.  Combine  egg and water, brush onto loaves. Bake in a 375 degreen oven about 25  minutes or until tops are golden. Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at  room temperature. Slice to serve. Makes 72 spirals.    To make ahead:  Wrap the baked and cooled loaves individually in heavy foil  and freeze.  To reheat, bake each foil wrapped roll in a 300 degree oven  about 30 minutes or until heated through.  (Does not say whether to thaw  out loaves or to put them in frozen!)    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 04 Oct 96    Date:    Fri, 4 Oct 1996 14:29:16 -0400    From:    Laura Hunter <LHunter722@AOL.COM>
