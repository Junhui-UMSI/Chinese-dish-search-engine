Pork Tenderloin with Jalapeno Sauce
Salt, JALAPENO JELLY SAUCE, Sour cream, Jalapeno jelly, Coarsely ground black pepper, Jalapeno jelly, Pork tenderloin, 
Place 2 lbs. pork tenderloins in a shallow roasging pan lined w/ heavy duty  aluminum foil. Melt 3 Tbs. jalapeno jelly in a small saucepan or the  microwave (set LOW -- jelly burns easily) and brush on pork. Sprinkle with  salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Roast at 425 F for 15-20 minutes or  until instant meat thermometer indicates internal temp. of 160 F.    Meanwhile, melt another 3 Tbs. of jelly and stir in 1/3 C. sour cream, and  heat until blended, stirring regularly.    Remove pork from oven, letting it rest for 5 minutes to "set" the juices.  Slice into 3/4-1 inch medallions and serve with the sauce.    This is adapted from M. Cunninghams _The Supper Book_, in which she  accurately characterizes the sauce as "a shocking pink." Naturally, the  heat will vary depending on the jelly you use; I used a small-batch brand I  purchased in North Carolina this summer, so it was quite warm.    "Jack W.
