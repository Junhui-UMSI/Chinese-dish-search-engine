Cut tortillas in one-and-a-half inch squares, and saute quickly in oil  until crispy. Place them on paper towels to prevent their becoming soggy,  then wrap them in paper towels to keep them warm, and set aside.    Saute chopped onion in oil until golden. Puree tomatoes in food processor  or blender, and pour into cooking pot with sauteed onions. Add chopped  cleery, cut corn, chopped green beans, and chopped cabbage. Bring soup  liquids to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer until vegetables are  tender (about twenty minutes). Before serving, season liberally with Spike  and Vegit, and add a dash of hot sauce.    Place tortilla squares into soup bowls. Pour in soup and top with generous  helpings of grated nuts.  Serves 6-8.
