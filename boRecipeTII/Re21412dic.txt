1. Cook a vegetable mix with potatoes, peas, green chillies and lots of  masala. Check for salt, before you stuff it in the pastry roll; no way to  rectify it later. 2. Thaw the roll for about 10 minutes before unfolding.  3. After the pastry roll has thawed, open it out on a flat sheet and roll  it with a pin to make it a little thinner. The pastry sheet would now be  about 12 x  12. 4. Cut the sheet into 6 pieces. 5. Place about 2-3  table spoons of the cooked vegetable and fold the sheet around it. Seal all  the corners by pressing the sheets together and applying a little water. 6.  Stick it into a pre-heated oven (350 F) for about 20-30 minutes or till it  browns. Make sure that you flip it around every 5-10 minutes.    Recipe By     : Somesh Rao
