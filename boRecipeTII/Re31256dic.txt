A great dessert with no  sugar added.    Cut the bananas into quarter-inch slices, coat with the lemon juice, place  on a cookie sheet, and freeze.    After the bananas are frozen, puree them with the remaining ingredients in  the appliance of your choice (my cuisinart had to work pretty hard, but it  was very entertaining for the son to watch strawberries become sorbet.)    Serve immediately in chilled cups. Leftovers dont freeze well, but they  make a nice flavoring for homemade yogurt.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
