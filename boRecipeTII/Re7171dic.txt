submitted by: suzanne@axess.com  Hi everyone I found this delicious chinese menu in a recipe archive.  I  would also like to tell everyone of a superb recipe manager program  (software) that has just been released yesterday called "Mega Bites". Its  so easy to use and does much more than just organize recipes. It has a menu  manager, a weight manager and food resources (such as a cooking dictionary,  spice associations, substitutions, measurment equivalencies and nutritionl  content), and more. You can try out the demo which has 40 recipes included  for free. For all you food lovers this is something you just cant afford  to miss out on.
