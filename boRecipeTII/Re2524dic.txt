Beat until  smooth. Melt butter in non-stick omelet pan or skillet. Cover pan well with  butter as it melts. Beat eggs with remaining ingredients. Pour into pan and  tilt to spread eggs to edges. Cook over low heat. Loosen eggs from sides of  pan with spatula as they begin to set. Lift eggs with spatula and tilt pan  to allow uncooked eggs to run to sides and under eggs to continue cooking.  Carefully lift one side of outer edge of eggs with spatula and fold over  towards center making a half circle or flattened cone. Slide omelet out of  pan onto dish and serve. If filling omelet, spoon filling mixture on top of  and in the center of omelet prior to folding edges over to form half  circle.  When omelet is ready to turn toward center, spoon peaches onto  center for filling.
