Atole De Leche (Milk with Masa Drink)
Piloncillo, Vanilla extract, Masa harina, cinnamon, Water, milk, 
Dissolve the masa harina in 1 quart of water, then strain the water into a  saucepan (throw away the masa). Boil until it is thick, stirring with a  wooden spoon, about 15 minutes.    Add the milk, piloncillo, vanilla, and canela. Bring the liquid back to a  simmer, stirring often to thicken. This will take about 45 minutes, keeping  the heat at a minimum so the milk doesnt curdle.    Remove the canela stick before serving.
