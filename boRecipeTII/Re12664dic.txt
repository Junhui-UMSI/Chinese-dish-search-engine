The pronounced flavor of walnuts is tamed somewhat by the acidic tang of  fresh yogurt.  Beating the yogurt, much like whipping cream, gives the  sauce a very special texture. Serve it with poultry, salads, cold poached  or baked fish, or with cold steamed shrimp or lobster. While it can be  tossed with the other ingredients, it is better when it is spooned onto the  salads by the individual diners. Prepare this dressing on the same day that  you plan to serve it.    Beat the lemon juice into the yogurt in a medium-size bowl. Fold in the  remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate the dressing several hours, beating  once more just before serving.      A very simple recipe that I am sure that no one would have tasted before.  Simply a grand recipe for the next dinner party. Highly Recommended.
