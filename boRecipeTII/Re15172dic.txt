Taken from the Bakeries of Belfast website at    http://www.infolane.com/corweb/baker.html    Mix dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Cut in margarine with a  pastry blender. Beat eggs, add liquids and mix with dry ingredients. Turn  onto floured board and knead gently to form a loaf. Place in a 9x5 loaf  pan. Bake at 375 degrees for 55-60 minutes. The dough can also be baked in  a round shape on a baking sheet. After kneading, shape into a round and cut  with a knife about 1/2 inch deep, in a cross shape. It will take less time  to bake, about 45-50 minutes.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #231 by jrjet@mtco.com (Dot & Tim  McChesney) on Sep 11, 1997
