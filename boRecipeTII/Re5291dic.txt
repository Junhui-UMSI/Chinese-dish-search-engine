Pinapple Dainty
Egg yolks, Sugar, egg whites, Manischewitz Matzo meal, pinapple, crushed, canned, nuts, 
I have just come across this recipe for Pareve Vegetable Soup. from The  Bulletin, Aug. 23, l974-- an old one -- all these reciopes are from the  same source.    Beat 5 egg yolks and 1 cup sugar until light. Add 3/4 c. Manischewitz Matzo  meal, 1/2 c. crushed nuts and 1 1/2 cups crushed pinapple (drained)    Fold in 5 stiffly beaten egg whites. Turn into greased 8 x 8 squsare pan.  Bake at 350* for 30 minutes, cut into squares    Can be served cold as a dainty, or in squares hot with whipped cream or  non-dairy topping with meat meals as a light dessert.
