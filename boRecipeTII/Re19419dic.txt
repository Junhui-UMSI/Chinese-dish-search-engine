1. Transfer the kidney beans and the water in which they were soaked  to a large heavy saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and bring to a  boil over high heat. Lower the heat and continue boiling the beans,  partially covered, until tender, about 1 hour. Watch the water level  and add more, if necessary, to keep the beans from scorching.    2. Meanwhile, place the tomato juice in another saucepan and bring to  a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat immediately and add the  bulghur to the juice. Cover and let stand for 15 minutes. It should  be slightly crunchy. Set aside.    3. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add the  onions and garlic and cook until the onions are translucent. Add the  celery, carrots, tomatoes, lemon juice, and all the spices -  including the remaining salt - to the onions and cook, covered, until  the vegetables are nearly tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the  bell peppers and continue cooking another 10 minutes.    4. Add the kidney beans, the water in which they cooked, and the  bulghur to the vegetables in the large pot. Stir the mixture  thoroughly and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat. The chili may be  thick - add water as necessary and stir occasionally making sure the  bulghur does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Taste and adjust  seasonings.
