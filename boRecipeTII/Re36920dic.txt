Strawberry Spiral Pie
(About 4 1/2 Cups), Cinnamon, Strawberries Hulled,Washed, Cornstarch, Ground ginger, And Drained, Unsalted butter, Strawberry Jam, Quick cooking tapioca, Biscuit Dough (Check Pies, Nutmeg, Sugar, Pastries), 
Preheat the oven to 450, and line the oven floor with foil to catch any  drips. Spread the strawberries on paper towels to dry. In a small bowl,  stir the jam to loosen it. In a saucepan, melt the butter and keep warm. In  a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, tapioca,ginger,cinnamon,nutmeg  and sugar.  Halve any very large berries. Gently toss the berries with the  dry ingredients. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the biscuit dough  into a 10x18 rectangle. Square off the corners. Brush the dough lightly  with about half of the melted butter. Using an icing spatula, spread the  jam over the rectangle, leaving a 1/2 inch border on one long side.  Starting at the opposite long side, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion  and pinch the seam closed. Roll the log so that it is an even diameter,  exactly 18 inches long; turn the log seam side down. Using a large sharp  knife, quarter te log, then cut each quarter into 3 equal pieces so that  there will be 12 spiraled biscuits in all. Using a rubber spatula, fold the  strawberry filling once to remix. Spoon the filling into a 9 inch glass pie  plate and smooth the top.  Arrange the pie and the remaining 4 biscuits in  the center.  Dont push the biscuits down into the strawberries. Bake the  pie for 20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is  bubbling.  Lower the oven temp to 350 loosely cover the pie with foil and  bake for 15 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack to cool for 30 minutes  before serving.
