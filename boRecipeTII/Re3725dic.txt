To prepare the marinara base:  Combine the garlic and basil in a food  processor or blender and chop finely. Add the salt, black pepper and water;  process 30 seconds. Stir into the tomatoes and set aside.    To prepare the puttanesca sauce:  Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan.  Add the anchovies and cook, mashing with the back of a spoon, until  disintegrated. Add the garlic, parsley and crushed red pepper flakes. Cook  1 minute.  Add the capers and olives; cook seconds.    Stir in the marinara base and simmer 5 minutes.  Keep warm.    Cook the pasta in lots of boiling water according to package directions.  Drain and put back into the hot pan.    Add the sauce and Parmesan.  Stir well and transfer to a heated bowl for  serving.    Note:  The original recipe called for 2 Tbsp salt and 3 Tbsp crushed red  pepper flakes.  Times testers felt that the reduced amounts were adequate.  [Moderators Note: Maybe for the salt....]    Obmodification:  I plan to reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup next time, which  is probably more than adequate and cuts down a bit on the fat.

As a puttanesca connoisseur,  Ive found that Salvatore Ristorante Italiano in Seattle makes the *best*  puttanesca Ive had at any restaurant in the area. The following has been  shared by the owner, Salvatore Anania. Hope you enjoy it as much as I.       From: Sandra Vigil, vigil@esca.com
