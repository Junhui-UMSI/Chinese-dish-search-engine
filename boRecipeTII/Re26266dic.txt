Tomato and Bread Salad
fresh basil, Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, olive oil, tomatoes, Onion, French bread baguette, Garlic, 
Preheat oven to 300 F. Split the baguette in half lengthwise. Rub one half  very well with the mashed garlic on the cut side. Brush liberally with  olive oil. Cut the garlicked half in half again lengthwise and then cut  these strips into 3/4-inch pieces. Place croutons on a cookie sheet, crust  side down. Bake until dark golden, about 30 minutes or more. If croutons  are made in advance, place tomatoes in a large mixing bowl a bit before you  intend to mix the salad, then drain and discard any juice that may have  accumulated in the bottom of the bowl. To serve, add the croutons, onions,  and basil to the tomatoes. Whisk together the vinegar and oil for the  vinaigrette. Pour over salad and toss.
