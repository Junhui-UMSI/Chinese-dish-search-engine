Seeing I havent posted in quite a while, I thought that I would post  lowfat from the Taste of Home Lowfat Country Cooking. Out of 455 recipes I  only have 44 formatted. Plan on formatting the rest this week. Hope you all  enjoy these.    Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and baking soda; set aside. In  large bowl, whisk together yogurt, egg, margarine and milk. Stir flour  mixture into liquid mixture until jus combined. Fold in raspberries. Heat a  griddle coated with nonstick cooking spray over medium-heat. Drop batter by  1/4 cupfuls onto griddle; cook for 1 minute or until bubbles form on top of  pancakes. Turn and cook 1 minute more. If desired, dust with confectioners  sugar and serve with jam.
