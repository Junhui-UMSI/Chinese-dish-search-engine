Found this from an old magazine Harrowsmith without permission.     Place quinoa in a fine-meshed sieve and rinse under warm running water for        1    min. Set aside.     Heat butter in a heavy, med. saucepan over med. heat. Add tomatoes,  shallots and garlic and saute for 3-5 mins, or till shallots are softened.  Add stock or water and bring to a boil. Stir quinoa and cayenne, return to  a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about 30 mins, or  until liquid is absorbed. Let sit for 5 mins, and fluff grains with a fork  to separate. Stir in fresh parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serves  4.    (this ancient Peruvian grain has a nutty, almost sweet flavour that really  needs no accent but is excellent with tomatoes and shallots).
