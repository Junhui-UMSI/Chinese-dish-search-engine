You have given me so many soup recipes, I thought you might like this one.  I use it as is or as a base for Clam Chowder, Corn Chowder, or any soup  that calls for a cream base. Saute onions in butter until transparent, add  flour and mix well.  Then add 3 cups chicken stock, stir well and simmer  slowly.  In a separate pot put the other 3 cups chicken stock, potatoes,  leek and bring to a boil.  Let simmer for 20 minutes. Then mix both pots,  add the cream and check for seasoning {salt}. Top with parsley. Makes 6  servings. Nancy/Crockett CA/12:26 PM PDT FROM:     NANCY JACKSON   (BMWN78B)
