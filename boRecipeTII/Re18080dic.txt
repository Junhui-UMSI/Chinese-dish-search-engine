Veggie Oat-Burgers
Onion, soy sauce, reduced sodium, Liquid smoke, Water, Old-fashioned rolled oats, Nutritional yeast, Garlic powder, Oregano, fresh, 
Bring all ingredients except the oats to a boil.  Turn heat to low and stir  in 4.5 cups rolled oats.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the water is  absorbed.  Dont overcook. If it is too soupy, add some oats at about 5  minutes and cook for only a few more minutes until thickened.    Fill a rectangular non-stick baking pan with the mixture (makes square  patties, easier than forming little circles). The pan could be anywhere  from 9 x 18 inches (22.5 X 45 cm.), 12 inches (30 cm.) square or larger to  make patties about a half-inch (1.3 cm.) thick. If too thin theyll be  tough and will dry out.    Total cooking time is 45 minutes. Bake at 350 F. for 25 minutes. Then use a  utensil that wont scratch your pan to cut the giant burger into 3.5" to 4"  (10 cm.) square burgers and flip them over. Cook another 20 minutes. Serve  in buns or as a main course, hot or cold. Can be frozen.    (Oh, the McD I refer to above is the guilty arches, not Dr. John)    Recipe originator unknown.
