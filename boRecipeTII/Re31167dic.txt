Add honey gradually  and continue beating until well mixed. Beat in mashed banana, butter, sour  cream and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture. (Dough should be soft.) Chill 2  hours or longer. Roll out on floured board about 1/4-inch thick. Cut with  doughnut cutter. In deep fat heated to 370 F, fry a few at a time.  (Fry  the holes as well as the doughnuts.) Turn doughnuts when they rise to the  surface and are brown on the underside. Fry until brown on both sides.  Remove from fat and drain thoroughly.    Note: May form into long rolls and twist together to form crullers, cutting  off every 2 inches.
