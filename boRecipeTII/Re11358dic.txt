In Santa Maria along the Central Coast of California, a tradition was  started of barbecuing a marinated beef tri-tip and serving it with pinto  beans, sourdough bread and salsa. The two marinades featured here offer two  distinctively different flavors. Either is easy to prepare and is an  excellent complement to the robust flavor of the beef tri-tip.    Remove all fat and connective tissue from the tri-tips. Prepare marinade of  choice. Place tri-tips in non-reactive baking dish, such as glass or  enamel; pour in marinade and cover. Refrigerate at least 6 hours, but no  longer than 24 hours. Remove tri-tips from marinade and barbecue over  medium-hot coals, turning occasionally, about 35 minutes for rare. Brush  with oil frequently while barbecuing. To serve, cut across the grain into  thin slices and season to taste. Makes 12 servings.    CuminUnLime Marinade: Mix all ingredients together in a non-reactive bowl.  Makes about 2 1/4 cups.    Jalape?o Marinade: Place 1/2 cup wine, chiles, oregano and 2 tbsp oil in  blender or food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until finely  minced. Stir in remaining oil and wine. Makes about 2 1/4 cups.  Posted to bbq-digest V5 #780 by Lloyd <lloyd2@mindspring.com> on Dec 22,  1997
