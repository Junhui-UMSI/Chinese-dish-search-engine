submitted by: angus.bell@zetnet.co.uk  Anne Bell, Guisborough. Cleveland, England. Probably your only english  subsriber, Well I haven`t seen any other recipes from here up until now.  This is my husbands favourite dinner. Serves 3-4.    Marinate the lamb in half the soy sauce for at least an hour. Brush with  half the oil, grill for 3-5 mins either side. Fry onion in remaining oil  until golden, add garlic, lemon juice, sugar, peanut butter, chilli,  remaining soy sauce 250ml water and any left over marinade. Stir over heat  until well mixed. Pour over lamb on a bed of rice. Don`t just enjoy, it`s  better than that!!!
