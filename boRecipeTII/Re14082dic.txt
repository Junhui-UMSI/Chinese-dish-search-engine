Stir dry ingredients together in 10-inch springform pan. Add  butter and nuts and mix well. Pat onto bottom and sides.    For filling: Beat cream cheese until light.  Add sugar and beat until light  and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time; beating after each. Add remaining  ingredients except berries and mix well. Pour into pan. Drop berries on top  and push down with fork so that batter covers them. Bake at 350 for 1-1/2  hours in which a pan of water has been placed on the bottom rack. Remove  from oven and run knife around the edge to loosen from pan and prevent a  cracked cake when cooling.    For topping: 1 pint raspberries 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup  cornstarch 2 Tbl rum (optional) Stir sugar and cornstarch WELL in saucepan.  Add berries and water and cook over medium heat until thick and bubbly.  Stir in rum. Pour over cooled cake. (I refrigerate the cake for a day  first, then put topping on just before serving).
