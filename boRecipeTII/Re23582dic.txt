Arroz Valenciana
Salt, Achiote, Chorizo (Spanish Sausage), Frozen Peas, Eggs, Carrot, Hot cooked rice, 
Fry sausage until well cooked and browned. Remove sausage from pan; keep  warm. If necessary, add enough oil to pan to make 2 tablespoons oil. Add  achiote; cook until oil is red. Combine chorizo with rice, peas, and carrot  in oil; mix, stirring frequently, until hot. Season to taste. Arrange  quaretered eggs on top and serve immediately.    NOTES : The Spanish use saffron to color their delicious paella, but in  Puerto Rico and many South American countries achiote (annatto seed) is  used to color native rice dishes. Achiote is tasteless. The red coloring is  obtained by slowly heating it in oil.  Recipe by: The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook By Betty L.
