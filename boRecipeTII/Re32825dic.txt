Sweet Potato Surprise (r T)
Salt, Cinnamon, Apple juice, Chopped Dried Apricots, Sweet Potatoes, Or Yams, Allspice, Green Apples, Or Ripe Pears,, Bananas, Peel, Chop, Minced Fresh Ginger, Butter, Or Canola Oil, *Note, Fresh Lemon Juice, Or Lime, 
*NOTE: Original recipe used 2 T butter or canola oil... I used 1 T.    **NOTE: Original recipe also used 2 C chopped nuts (optional)    Pureed sweet potatoes are combined with fresh ginger and sweet spices, plus  several surprises. The effect is delicious but subtle, and your guests will  have trouble identifying all the ingredients.    This can be assembled a day ahead and stored unbaked and tightly covered in  the refrigerator.    Peel the sweet potatoes or yams, and boil until soft. Drain.    Meanwhile, saute apples and bananas in butter or oil with ginger, cinnamon,  allspice and salt. Cook slowly, covered, but stirring intermittently for 10  ~ 15 minutes.    Preheat oven to 350 deg F. Spray nonstick cooking spray on a 9 x 13" baking  dish or deep casserole.    Puree the potatoes or yams with the fruit juices. A food processor with the  steel blade attachment works ideally for this.    Stir the sauteed fruit into the puree. (For a smoother texture you can  puree the fruit first before adding it to the sweet potatoes or yams.) Add  the apricots. Heap into the prepared baking pan and, if desired, top with  chopped nuts. (If it looks like the pan is getting too full, spray a pie  pan and bake the extra in there.)    Bake uncovered for 45 minutes.    This was absolutely incredible tasting!! I decided not to puree the fruit  and the texture difference was great.
