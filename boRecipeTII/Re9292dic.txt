I love Puerto Rican Food!... Its usually simple, yet rich with lots of  cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can be  simplified to taste.  I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and garlic  with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).    I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).    Pick over chick-peas, wash well, soak overnight in water and salt.    Drain chick-peas, rinse and place in large pot, together with pumpkin,  chorizo, and 2 1/2 quarts water.  Bring rapidly to a boil, cover, and boil  over moderate heat 1 1/2 hours or until chick-peas are almost tender.    Uncover, mash pumpkin and add sofrito, tomato sauce, and salt.    Mix and boil over moderate heat, uncovered, about 1 hour or until sauce  thickens to taste.
