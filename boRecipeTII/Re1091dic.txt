Corned Bear
Bear meat, boned and trimmed, Salt, Sugar, Baking soda, heaping, Saltpeter, Water, 
Here is something I found tucked away in the back of my recipe file. I can  vouch for the fact that it will make good eating, but the first ingredient  is not always handy when you want it. Another essential for this is a 20  gallon keg or stoneware crock. Salt the meat down in layers in the keg,  alternating layers of salt and meat. Let stand 24 hours. As soon as you  finish salting the meat, mix the sugar, soda and saltpeter in the water and  let stand.  After the meat has been in the salt for a day, pour the sugar  solution over the meat in the keg.  Keep the meat cover with liquid - a  plate with a brick or rock on it will help hold the meat down in the  solution. After 4 days drain the liquid from the keg into a large enamel  pan and bring the liquid to a boil. Strain out the blood residue by pouring  the liquid through cheesecloth. Return the solution to the keg and put the  plate and rock back to hold down the meat. Now store the keg in a very cool  place for 4 to 6 weeks. Use the meat as you would corned beef.
