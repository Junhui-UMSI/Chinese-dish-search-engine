:       For the Lobster Filling:  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Fill a  large stock pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over high  heat. Add lobsters and cook for about 8 minutes or until just done. Drain  and let lobsters cool slightly. Wrap tortillas tightly in foil and place in  preheated 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until heated through.  Keep warm until ready to use.  :       Remove meat from lobster tails being careful not to tear it apart.  Cut meat into thin medallions (or medium-sized dice, if meat breaks apart).  :         Heat oil in a medium saute pan over medium heat and saute lobster  medallions until just heated through.  :       Spoon equal portions of warm lobster medallions into the center of  each warm tortilla.  Sprinkle with equal portions of grated cheese and  shredded spinach.  :       Roll tortillas into a cylinder shape and place each one on a warm  serving plate with the edge facing the bottom.  :       Surround the taco with Yellow Tomato Salsa and garnish each side  with a small mound of Jicama Salad (separate recipe).    :       For the Yellow Tomato Salsa:  In a food processor, using the steel  blade, process tomatoes until well chopped.  Do not puree.  Combine  tomatoes and their juices with shallot, garlic, cilantro, vinegar, chilies,  lime juice, and salt, mixing well. Add maple syrup, if needed, to balance  flavor and sweeten slightly.  :       Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until very cold.  Note:  For a crunchier, more typical salsa, put tomatoes through fine die  of a food grinder.    Chefs Notes:  "I created this dish in early 1986 and it quickly became my  signature appetizer on The Mansion on Turtle Creek menu.  The name Lobster  Taco perfectly illustrates the casual elegance that characterizes  Southwest cuisine. Its appeal is rooted in the combination of rich lobster  and a simple flour tortilla. The salsa and salad garnishes produce an  explosion of color that promises exciting dining".    __The Mansion on Turtle Creek Cookbook__ by Dean Fearing, edited by Dotty  Griffith, 1987.
