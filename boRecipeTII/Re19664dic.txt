Another Gyros
Lean ground lamb, Clove garlic, pressed, Homemade bread, toasted and, Salt, to taste, Fresh savory, chopped, Onion, grated, Allspice, crushed, Coriander seed, crushed, Freshly ground pepper, to, Bacon slices (optional), 
In large bowl, combined all ingredients.  Mix well, kneading until mixture  is stiff.  Make fingers of meat (about 5-inches longer and not over  2-inches in diameter). Place fingers on skewer spacing about 1-inch apart.  Cook over hot coals for 10 to 15 minutes, turning frequently until cooked  through.    You may wrap the "fingers" on the skewer with sliced bacon. If anyone tries  this, let me know how it works out.    NOTE:  I have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S., but as I have  said, I view it as a "deli" item. Krinos Foods has a "gyros kit" that is  sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets.    Recipe:  C. Tenery Deriman on Prodigy -- ID:  KJNX92A
