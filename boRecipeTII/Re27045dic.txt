Three-Citrus Chicken Marinade
Fresh Lemon Juice, Fresh lime juice, Fresh orange juice, olive oil, Coarsely-ground black pepper, bay leaves, garlic, cilantro, Chicken, 
Mix all ingredients in shallow wide mixing bowl. Add chicken and marinate  1-2 hours.  Grill or broil, brushing marinade on chicken 2-3 times.    Marinade also may be used on salmon, tuna or shrimp. Reduce marinating time  so citrus does not "cook" seafood.
