After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly & cutting into serving  pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl. Make a marinade  by combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, &  vinegar & pouring over the meat.  Cover & refrigerate for a day or  two, turning the pieces over occasionally. On serving day, drain,  reserving the marinade, & wipe dry. Transfer the marinade to a  casserole & simmer for 15 minutes. While the marinade is cooking,  heat the butter in a large frying pan, & when very hot sear the meat  over high heat until it is reddened in color without browning. Remove  from the heat, & with a spatula lift the rabbit or hare pieces into  the simmering marinade, then pour in the remaining butter. Taste for  seasoning, then add the salt & pepper, tomatoes, & allspice. Weight  the meat with a small plate to keep it under the sauce, then bake it  in a very slow oven (225 F) for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is  tender & the sauce thickened.
