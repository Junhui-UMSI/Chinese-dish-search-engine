Add onion and saute until it begins to get tender (about 2  minutes). Add celery and carrot and saute for 2 minutes. Now add turkey and  saute until cooked. Add spices (parsley, basil, and oregano) and toss into  meat/vegetable mixture. Pour in wine, bring to a gentle boil, then reduce  heat, cover, and "steam" for 45 seconds. Remove lid and add tomato sauce,  tomato paste, and enough water to give the sauce a smooth but slightly thin  consistency. Simmer uncovered for 1 hour (or longer -- but you may have to  add water periodically). Serve on the pasta of your choice. Also makes a  good lasagna meat sauce.    Variations:    Add 1 t crushed red pepper to spice up the sauce.    Sqeeze in the juice of half a lemon for a more tangy sauce.    Add some fennel if you like the "anise-like" flavor.    Use Spanish red-pepper olive oil for part of the olive oil (spicy!).  Instead of using chopped garlic, take 2-3 heads of garlic and lightly brown  the whole peeled cloves in olive oil, remove, then return to the pot with  the rest of the sauce before simmering 1 hour. Omit the ground turkey for a  vegetarian sauce (though add more celery and carrot).    Use some sauteed chicken breast chunks (about 1") in place of turkey.    Make the sauce without any turkey, store away in the freezer, then use as a  basic sauce for cooking meats like: sausage, cut-up rabbit pieces, pour  over baked fish, etc.  Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 18, 1998
