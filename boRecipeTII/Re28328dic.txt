Baked Ham
Water, Cloves, whole, Ham, Mustard, dry, Flour, Maple syrup, Brown sugar, 
Note: This recipe assumes using an uncooked ham. Omit boiling the ham  altogether if using a pre-cooked ham. Wash ham and cover with boiling water  and let cook on top of stove for 4 hours. Let ham stand in liquid over  night. Next day remove the fatty rind, make gashes across the surface of  ham and stick in whole cloves. Make a paste of the sugar, flour and mustard  by adding the syrup and water. Use water in which ham was cooked if  available. Spread over ham and place in roasting pan. Bake uncovered at  400-F for       45    minutes.
