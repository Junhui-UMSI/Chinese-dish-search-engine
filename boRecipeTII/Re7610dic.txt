Pork Steaks in Adobo (Bistek De Puerco En Adobo)
Cumin seed, Pork blade steaks, Oregano, Onion, Whole dried ancho chiles, Coarse salt, Whole allspice, Orange juice, Vinegar, Garlic, cinnamon, Basil, Whole dried chipotle chiles, 
Heat one and one half cups of the orange juice to simmering in a saucepan.  Toast the ancho chiles on a griddle until softened, then destem / devein,  and place in the simmering orange juice along with the chipotles and take  off heat. Allow to soak for 20 minutes. Place the orange juice and chile  mixture in a blender, along with the onion, garlic, and vinegar, and puree  until the mixture has the consistency of yogurt. If more liquid is needed,  use the remaining orange juice. In a molcajete, or spice grinder, grind the  allspice, basil, oregano, cinnamon, cumin seed, and salt. Add this to the  pureed chiles. Place the meat in a glass or ceramic dish, coat and cover  the meat in this mixture, and allow to stand refrigerated for 4 - 6 hours.  Start a good, large charcoal or hardwood fire. Let the coals burn down to  rich embers. Shake the chile mixture off of the meat, retaining the  majority, but not scraping it off the meat. Add the remaining orange juice  and marinade to a sauce pan, boil briefly. Charbroil the meat over the  medium fire, basting occasionally with the orange / chile mixture until  done and the coating on the meat has become a caramelized and a bit  charred. Serve with the remaining sauce. This is how they basically made it  when I was in that wonderful, sunny country to the south of us. Add dried  pequin or tepin for more fire.
