Sweet Almond Tea #1
Almond meats, Salt, Water, Water, Water to cover, Vanilla, Sugar, Raw rice, 
1. Wash raw rice. Soak overnight in water to cover. Then drain well.    2. Blanch almonds. Grind almonds and rice to a fine powder, either by hand  (with a mortar and pestle), or in a food mill.    3. Place mixture in a bowl. Add the second quantity of water and let stand        1    hour; then stir thoroughly.    4. Strain mixture through a double thickness of cheesecloth into the top of  a double boiler. Gather together corners of the cheesecloth, and squeeze  the remaining liquid into the pan.    5. Boil remaining water in the lower half of the double boiler; then reduce  heat to medium. Cook almond-rice mixture over it, stirring until it  thickens. (During this period, "milk" the cheesecloth into the pan several  times.)    6. Next stir in sugar, salt and vanilla extract to dissolve; then turn up  heat to bring mixture quickly to a boil. Serve hot, in small bowls.    NOTE: This tea, which has the consistency of custard, is a wonderful snack  on cold days. VARIATIONS:    1. Omit the rice, salt and vanilla extract. In the top of the double  boiler, blend to a smooth, thick paste the ground almonds, 4 tablespoons  cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup cold water. Then stir in 1 large can of  evaporated milk and 6 more cups water. Cook until the mixture thickens,  stirring occasionally.    2. Omit step 3. Combine ground almonds and rice in a saucepan with the  sugar and 4 Cups water. Bring to a boil; then simmer, covered, 30 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Pick up step 6, adding the salt and vanilla extract.    3. In step 5 add to the almond-rice mixture, 12 Chinese red dates which  have been cooked in 1 to 2 cups boiling water until soft (about 20  minutes), then pureed through a fine sieve or ricer to remove the skins and  pits.
