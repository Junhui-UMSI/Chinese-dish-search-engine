Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small heavy-duty saucepan, bring 3/4 cup  sugar, butter and 1 tbs. water to boil, stirring constantly; remove from  heat. Add 3/4 cup chocolate chips; stir until smooth. Stir in vanilla. Add  eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Add flour, baking  soda and salt; stir until well blended. Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup  chocolate chips. Pour into waxed paper-lined and greased 9-inch round cake  pan. Bake about 20-25 minutes, until wooden pick inserted in center comes  out slightly sticky. Cool in pan 15 minutes. Invert onto wire rack: remove  waxed paper. Turn right-side up; cool completely. In a small bowl, beat  whipping cream and 1/4 cup sugar. Spread filling over brownie. Arrange  strawberry slices over whipped cream. Chill until serving time.    NOTES : I used the recipe for Stabilized whip cream in the filling and  garnished the top with blueberries over the strawberries.
