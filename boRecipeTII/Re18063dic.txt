Veggie Chili #2
-(up to), Garlic, Green bell pepper, Onion, Salt; pepper, other spices, Jalapenos, Chili powder (or more!), Red bell pepper, Red kidney beans, Whole Plum tomatos, Cumin, Veggie broth (bullion), Tomato paste, -(up to), Vegetable oil, 
Saute onions and garlic in oil until slightly soft.  Cut peppers into 1"  cubes, mince jalapenos and add to onions.  Cook until slightly soft.  Add  veggie bullion, tomatos (mushed up) with juice, 1/2 can tomato paste &  chili powder. Let it boil down for about 30-45 minutes, adding additional  tomato paste if needed. When almost thick enough to eat, add kidney beans  and cook for another 10-15 minutes. Serve with cornbread, tortilla chips &  shredded Jack cheese.    My roommate made this all the time in college.  You can add almost any  vegetable or bean  you want, and more jalapenos (or other chili peppers).    Sorry the recipe is not more specific, its best when you just throw it  together.  This freezes well, also.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
