Raspberry Coffee Cake
milk, Powdered sugar, Raspberry preserves, Vanilla, Cream cheese, Butter, milk, Bisquick, 
This doesnt HAVE to be Raspberry...use ANY favorite preserves. In a mixing  bowl, cut cream cheese and butter into biscuit mix untill mixture is  crumbly. Blend in milk. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and  knead 8 to 10 strokes. > On waxed paper, roll dough to form a 12x8"  rectangle. Carefully turn onto a greased baking sheet, and remove waxed  paper. Spread raspberry preserves evenly down center of dough. Make 2-1/2"  slits at 1" intervals on long sides of rectangle. Fold each strip toward  the center, over the raspberry filling. Bake at 425` for 12 to 15 minutes,  or until the pastry is golden brown. While warm, drizzle the coffee cake  with the glaze made from the powdered sugar, vanilla and milk (stirred  until smooth, and of drizzling consistency).
