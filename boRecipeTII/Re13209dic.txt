World Best Chocolate Easter Eggs
Salt, Semi-sweet chocolate, Vanilla, Condensed milk (Eagle Brand), Icing sugar, Butter, Yellow food coloring, 
I just found this recipe on the internet, but cant remember where. They  sound really good--I havent tried them yet, but will this week.    These delicious cream filled eggs taste just like a very famous store  bought one. They are easy to make and kids and adults love the.    Beat butter, salt and vanilla until fluffy. Add milk, beat in sugar. Blend  until stiff. Dust with brown sugar. Knead until smooth. Set aside more than  2/3 of mixture. To the remaining mixture add yellow food coloring. Blend in  well. Divide yellow and white into 16 or 24 pieces. Shape yellow into ball,  mold white around yellow to form an egg shape. Dry at room temperature on  paper towels for 24 hours. Melt chocolate in double boiler or in microwave  until smooth. Dip eggs in chocolate (paraffin wax may be added and melted  with chocolate to prevent chocolate from melting in your hands). Once  dipped, cool at room temperature. Refrigerate after cool.    When sliced, these eggs will have a white cream filling with a yellow  filling that appears to be the yolk. They look nice sitting in an Easter  basket. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest by Marie Woodman  <mwoodman@ix.netcom.com> on Mar 22, 97
