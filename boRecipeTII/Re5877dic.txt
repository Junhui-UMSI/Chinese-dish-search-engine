Piri-Piri
dried red chile, garlic, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, black pepper, Salt, Poblano chiles, Jalapeno chiles, 
This fiery Portuguese-African condiment came into my kitchen thanks to Chef  Emeril Lagasse of Emerils and NOLA restaurants in New Orleans.  He uses it  in several of his dishes, but its very versatile ... experiment! Its hot,  but it kinda creeps up on you. I am now never without a jar of this at  hand.    Combine all of the ingredients except the garlic in a small saucepan and  cook over high heat for 4 minutes, stirring frequently (be VERY careful as  you do this). Remove from heat and stir in the garlic. Let the mixture cool  to room temperature, then place in a food processor and pulse sixteen  times.    Pour into a jar and let it sit for one week before using. The piri-piri  will keep at room temperature for two months. Use as a marinade, a sizzling  sauce, an ingredient in a dish, or in place of regular oil for sauteing ...  theres lots of room for creativity. Experiment! Be creative!    Buy Chef Emerils book _Emerils New New Orleans Cooking_, published by  Random House, and see how he uses piri-piri. In fact, you can order it  online by telnetting to books.com, so do yourself and your dinner guests a  favor and buy it!
