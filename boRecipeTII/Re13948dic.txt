This sophisticated dish is deceptively simple to prepare. Two Cornish game  hens may be substituted for the quail. Skin and halve them before cooking,  and braise them for 35 to 40 minutes.    Tie quad legs together and tuck the wing tips under the bird. Combine  flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge the  quail in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet let over  medium-high heat and brown the birds well on all sides, for 5 to 6 minutes.  Pour off any fat.    Add wine, tomatoes and sage, and boil for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to  low, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the birds are tender and  the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove the birds to a warm platter.    Boil the sauce over medium-high heat until it thickens and is slightly  reduced, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and nap the  quail with the sauce.    229 CALORIES PER SERVING: 23 G PROTEIN, 6 G FAT, 9 G CARBOHYDRATE; 94 MG  SODIUM; 67 MG CHOLESTEROL.
