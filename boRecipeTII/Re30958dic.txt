Taramosalata
Tarama (fish roe), -Potatoes, boiled & peeled, Water (more if necessary), olive oil, Onion, (optional); grated, Vinegar, French or Italian bread;-OR-, 
Soak the tarama in warm water a few minutes, then rinse and drain. If using  bread slices, discard crusts, soak bread in water, then squeeze dry. Using  an electric blender or electric mixer (or old-fashioned mortar and pestle),  thoroughly blend the bread or potatoes and the tarama. Add the olive oil as  slowly as possible, blending at medium speed, plus a little water if the  mixture forms peaks. Add the grated onion, if desired, then whip at high  speed for a few minutes. Note: The flavor may be mitigated to suit taste by  adding more bread or potato; a too-salty taste may be adjusted by dropping  in a few tablespoons of sour cream while blending. Leftover taramasalata  can be stored in a covered jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.
