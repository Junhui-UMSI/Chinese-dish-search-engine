Lightly butter the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.  Place the rice  cereal and the toasted hazelnuts in the bowl of a food processor fitted  with the metal chopping blade.  Process the mixture for 25 to 30 seconds,  until finely ground.  Transfer the cereal/nut mixture to a medium bowl.    2.  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler over low heat.  Using a  rubber spatula, scrape the melted chocolate into the cereal mixture in the  bowl.  Stir the mixture until combined; scrape it into the prepared pan.  Press the cereal mixture evenly o ver the bottom of the pan. Place the pan  in the refrigerator.    MAKE THE WHITE CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT FILLING:    2.  Place the white chocolate in a large bowl.  In a small saucepan over  medium heat, bring the milk to a gentle boil.  Pour the hot milk over the  chocoalte and let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate.  Add the warm gelatin mixture and vanilla; whisk until smooth.  Place the  bowl over a larger bowl of ice water and stir for 5 to 10 minutes, or until  the mixture is cool.    3.  In a chilled medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the  cream at medium speed until it begins to form soft mounds.  Do not overbeat  or the mousse will be grainy.  Fold one-third of the whipped cream into the  white chocolate mixture.  Fold in the remaining whipped cream. Set the  mousse aside at room temperature.    ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:    1.  Remove the prepared springofrm pan from the refrigerator.  Slice a  strawberry in half lengthwise.  Arrange the two halves next to each other,  stem-side-down with the cut side agains the side of the pan.  Continue to  cut strawberries and fill in the bo rder of the pan, cutting only as many  strawberries as needed.  Fill in the center of the pan with shole  strawberries, placing them stem-side-down and using as many as needed.  Reserve the remaining strawberries for garnish.    2.  Carefully scrape the white chocolate mousse over the strawberries.  Using a small metal spatula, smooth the op of the mousse so that it is  even.  Refrigerate the cake for four hours, until the mousse is firm.  (Do  not refrigerate the cake for longer t han 6 hours, as the strawberries will  release water and cause the cake to collapse when sliced.)    MAKE THE WHITE CHOCOLATE GLAZE:    1.  Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler over low heat and set  aside.  In a small saucepan, bring the cream and corn syrup to a gentle  boil.  Stir the hot cream into the melted chocolate until smooth.    GLAZE AND GARNISH THE CAKE:    1.  Remove the cake from the refirgerator.  Pour the white chocolate glaze  evenly over the top of the cake, covering it completely.  Return the cake  to the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set the glaze.    2.  To unmold the cake, carefully run a small, hot knife around the edge of  the pan.  Undo the clasp on the springform pan and remove the side of the  pan.  Garnish the top of the cake with the remaining straberries sliced,  and rosettes of whipped cream.
