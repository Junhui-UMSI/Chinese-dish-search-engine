Basic Yeast Dough
water, Salt, Shortening, Dry yeast, Egg, Sugar, 
3 1/2 c c  all-purpose flour; up to 3    Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl; let stand 5 minutes.  Add sugar, shortening, egg, salt, and half of flour; beat at low speed of  an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually stir in enough remaining flour to  make a soft dough.    Place dough in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover and let  rise in a warm place (85F), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in  bulk, or cover and refrigerate up to 5 days. (If refrigerated, let return  to room temperature before proceeding.)    Punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 4 or 5  times. Shape and bake as directed.
