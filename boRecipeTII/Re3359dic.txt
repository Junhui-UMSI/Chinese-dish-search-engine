This is in response to requests Ive seen here from time to time. The  following recipes are from _Flavors of India: Recipes from the Vegetarian  Hindu Cuisine_, by Shanta N. Sacharoff, reprinted without permission.  Comments in parentheses are mine, and Ive paraphrased some portions. Ive  tried these and several other recipes from this book & highly recommend it!    My favorite rice is basmati, for its texture and fragrance, but you can  also use jasmine rice or ordinary long-grain white rice. You may want to  wash and drain the rice. If you use converted rice, increase the amount of  water accordingly.    Melt the butter in a large pot over a low flame. Add the pepper, onion,  ginger, and whole spices. Heat and stir continually for several min. Add  the rice and continue stirring so the rice gets coated with the butter and  spices. (I like to saute the rice long enough that most of it turns a dull  white color and even begins to brown a bit.) Add the peas, the water and  the salt and stir. If a yellow color is desired, add the turmeric. Bring to  a boil, then lower the heat again, cover the pot, and simmer about 20 min.  until the water has been absorbed and the rice is soft and fluffy. If you  use canned peas, drain them and add them during the last few minutes of  cooking. Serve with the whole spices left in, but warn your guests not to  chomp on them.    (You can add or substitute all manner of vegetables (diced carrots,  cauliflower, red & yellow bell peppers, etc.) and nuts (pine nuts, pieces  of cashews or almonds or pistachios) to this dish... be imaginative!)
