Beaten eggs, Vanilla, Sugar, Salt, milk, Filo dough, Cornstarch, 
Divide one package of filo dough into eight sections, stretching each  to fit an 8 or 9" square pan. Bake on large baking sheets until  golden. Set aside to cool.    Meanwhile, make filling. Mix 2/3 cup sugar with 2 tbsp. corn starch  and a dash of salt.  Slowly add 2 cups milk, stirring to dissolve.  Place in sauce pan over medium heat. Beat four eggs, and when the  milk mixture begins to boil, pour about half of the hot mixture over  the eggs and stir well. Pour all of this back into the sauce pan and  continue to cooking until thick. Remove from heat and add one  teaspoon vanilla.    In the baking pan put one layer of pastry, spread about 1/2 cup  filling evenly over the top. Add the next layer of pastry. Repeat six  times, beginning and ending with pastry.  Store in refrigerator. It  is better if this dessert is made two or three days before serving so  that the layers have time to "marry." Cut in small rectangles and  serve.
