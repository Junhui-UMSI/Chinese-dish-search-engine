Veal Stifado
olive oil, Peeled tomatoes; chopped, Cinnamon, Salt & freshly ground pepper, Garlic, Cloves, Red wine vinegar, Lean veal; in 1-1/2" cubes, White or brown sugar, Small white onions; peeled, Dry Red Wine, Bay leaf, Chopped fresh parsley, Butter; cut into bits, 
In a baking-serving casserole, heat the oil, then add the veal and saute on  all sides.  Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper. Stir with a  wooden spoon, then add the vinegar, wine, tomatoes, bay leaf, sugar, and  enough water to cover the veal.  Arrange the onions over the meat, sprinkle  the parsley and butter bits over the top, and slip the spices in between  the meat and the onions.  Shake the casserole a few times, then cover with  an inverted plate to keep in place and cover tightly with a lid (using a  little flour-water paste around the inside of the lid to seal if you wish).  Bake in a slow oven (300 F) for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or over minimum heat on a  burner, until the veal and onions are tender. Remove from the heat and  serve warm. Note: After peeling the onions, pierce the root end of each  onion with the tip of a small, sharp knife, then slash again at a right  angle to make a cross. This will keep the onion whole and intact during the  cooking process.
