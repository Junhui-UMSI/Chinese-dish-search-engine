Aaronson Corn Muffins

I like to add the Mexicorn and bacon to this recipe. It certainly does  enhance the flavor, but if you want plain corn muffins, you can certainly  omit these 2 ingredients. Preheat oven to 400~. Youll need either one or  two 12 unit muffin tins, lined with cupcake papers. Whisk the dry  ingredients together, throughly, in a bowl and set aside. Whisk the sour  cream, eggs amd melted butter together until well-blended. Make a well in  the dry ingredients, pour in cream/butter/egg mixture and if youre adding  the corn and bacon, add them now. Using a spatula, fold the ingredients  together, just until combined--DONT OVERMIX. Spoon the mixture into the  lined muffin tins, filling them evenly, about 3/4 full. Bake for 20-25  minutes, testing until a wooden pick comes out clean. Let me know if these  muffins are what youre looking for.  I have more recipes if theyre not.
