Buttermilk Spoon Cornbread
Baking soda, White Cornmeal, Salt, Egg, milk, Butter, Buttermilk, Boiling water, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use a heavy cast iron skillet. Thoroughly  grease the skillet with bacon drippings. Prewarm the skillet in the oven -  it MUST be HOT! Pour the BOILING water over the cornmeal. Mix well and cool  slightly. In a separate bowl, combine the egg, butter, buttermilk, baking  soda and salt. Beat well. Add to the cornmeal. Pour the batter into the HOT  skillet. Bake for an hour. Periodically baste the top of the bread with the  milk.    From Joel Erhlich 3/23/95.
