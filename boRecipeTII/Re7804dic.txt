Just like everyone has their preference  how much cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. they like on their sandwich.    Turn on broiler.  Put bread on a cookie sheet (if using a loaf, cut in  half) and put into oven. Watch closely for about 5 minutes until it is  lightly toasted. Remove from oven. Set aside the bread and spray the cookie  sheet. Put mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and whatever else youd like  to broil on the cookie sheet. Watch closely for about 5 minutes until  cooked.  Remove from oven.    Put bottom half of bread on the cookie sheet.  Put mushrooms, onions,  peppers, whatever on the bread topped with cheese (I wanted to use  Provolone, but cannot find fatfree / very low fat brand). Put tops of bread  on the sheet (NOT on the sandwich). Put back in the oven until cheese melts  and bread is warm again (again about 5 minutes). Take out of the oven and  put garnish and tops on sandwiches.    * I used Bread Machine French bread slices.  Can use store bought French  bread, sub rolls, or whatever.    fatfree digest V96 #210    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
