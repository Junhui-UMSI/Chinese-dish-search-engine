For all of the folks from Memphis and the unknown, that requested the  recipe for Texas Style Fajitas! Here it is:     Precut flank steak, or buy whole and cut to finger size.     Sautee onions in butter. Comine all ingredients. Let marinate overnight.  Cook over charcoal preferably hardwood. Mesquite if you have it, pecan or  hickory are also excellent.     There are many variations to any recipe, and you may wish to modify to fit  your own taste. We serve 5 to 600 lbs. at our customer meeting,  and....theres nothing ever left.     If you find a better variation, drop me a line!!    AT986@FREENET.CARLETON.CA    (WARD TOMLINSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
