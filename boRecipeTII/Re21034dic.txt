Twenty-Four Hour Salad
Mild cheddar cheese, grated, Green pepper, chopped, Head romaine lettuce, Head iceberg lettuce, Or 2 sour cream, Sweetish onions, chopped, Or 3 sugar, Celery, chopped, Parmesan cheese, grated, Frozen peas, rinsed, More parmesan cheese, 
Wash the lettuce.  Break into pieces, line the bottom of a [large] bowl.  Add layers of peas, onion, green pepper, celery, cheddar, more lettuce,  another layer of everything, top with lettuce. Sprinkle parmesan cheese  over the top.    Combine equal amounts of mayonnaise and sour cream, add sugar, mix well.  Spread over the top of the salad. Sprinkle more parmesan on top.    Cover and chill 12-24 hours.    Some people say to toss before serving; this makes for soggy leftovers if  you dont eat it all.  I suggest dishing out portions at a time and tossing  the portion separately (keep the rest in layers with the dressing on top,  it will be good for a couple of days).
