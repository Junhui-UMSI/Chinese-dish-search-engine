Traditonal Japanese Teriyaki Marinade

Here are two much simpler ones that I use.  Both with marinate at  2 pound steak to serve 4-6 depending on how carnivorous the eaters are. I  use flank steak for these, but any steak or pieces of tender meat for  skewering can be used.    For either marinade: Score both sides of steak in a diamond pattern with a  sharp knife. Mix ingredients with the steak in a ziplock freezer bag. Press  to expel air and let meat marinate from 2-24 hours.  Preferably cook on a  grill over coals or electric heat, turning once, to the desired degree of  doneness.  I dont baste the meat with the marinade because it is already  pretty salty, but that is a taste thing.  Slice in thin (1/8-1/4 inch)  slices across the grain. This is just as good room temp as hot - a  consideration for shabbat?    JEWISH-FOOD digest 257    From the Jewish Food recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
