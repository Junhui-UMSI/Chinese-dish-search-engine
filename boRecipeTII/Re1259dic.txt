Rinse the lentils or split peas. In a covered saucepan, bring the water and  lentils or peas to a boil. Reduce heat, uncover, and simmer for about 30  minutes, until tender.    In a large soup pot, saute the onion and chile in the saute liquid for  several minutes. Add the sweet potatoes, curry powder, cumin, and ginger,  and continue to saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often. Pour in the 2  cups water. Add the cauliflower florets and add to the pot. Add the bell  peppers, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.    While the vegetables simmer, rinse, stem, and coarsely chop the spinach.  Pour the lentils or peas and their cooking liquid into a blender or food  processor and puree for 2 to 3 minutes to make a smooth dahl. When the  cauliflower is tender, stir in the spinach, the dahl, and the lemon juice.  Simmer just until the spinach has wilted.    Serve immediately with Basmati rice or other grain. Serves 6.    Adapted from _Moosewood Cooks at Home_    Notes: I use veggie water left over from steaming veggies when water is  called for. Also, our spinach crop was done for the season when I made  this, so I used Swiss chard in place of the spinach.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Lachman, Diane" <dlachman@path.org> on Oct 6,  1998,
