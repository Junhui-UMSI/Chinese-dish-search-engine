Dried Ground Crayfish, Coconut milk, Rice, uncooked, Cayenne Pepper, Canned Tomatoes, Onion, Salt, 
Bring coconut milk to a boil. combine rice, crayfish, tomatoes and onions  with coconut milk in steaming pan; season with salt and cayenne pepper to  taste. Cover and steam until rice is quite dry, 18 to 20 minutes. Fluff  with fork before serving. Adjust seasoning if necessary.    Variation:    To make coconut milk, cover fresh grated coconut with hot water  (approximately 3 cups). Let soak 20 to 30 minutes. Place in colander; drain  over a bowl, squeezing out as much liquid as possible. Makes about 2 cups.  If not, add a bit more water to the grated coconut, drain again.    NOTES : Rice is cooked in coconut milk as is sometimes done in the Far  East. The West African touch is the addition of tomatoes and onions.  Recipe by: The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Betty L.
