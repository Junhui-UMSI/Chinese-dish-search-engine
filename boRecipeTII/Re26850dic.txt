Baked Beans
Tabasco to taste, Ginger, Hamburger; browned, Liquid smoke, Cheap yellow mustard, Ketchup, Maple syrup, Garlic powder, Thick sliced bacon; cooked,, Brown sugar, 1 pound cans baked beans;, Onion; sliced, 
Combine all in crockpot, low for 6 hours. Though meal is fully cooked at  start, flavors blend much better at end of time period. This is probably my  most requested recipe.Spice it up to your taste. I add cayenne and habanero  powder for a nice burn.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 11 Sep 96    Date:    Thu, 12 Sep 1996 10:56:37 -0400    From:    Ken Gomberg <kgomberg@MINT.NET>
