This is considered Quebec style, using rolled oats instead of potatoes to  thicken the filling shows a Scottish influence. Servings: 6    In a large, heavy frying pan, combine pork with cold water and heat to  boiling point. Add onion, celery, pepper, bay leaf, savoury, rosemary,  nutmeg and cinnamon. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 1 1/2 hours,  adding more water if mixture dries out. Halfway through cooking time,  season with salt to taste. Stir in rolled oats and cook, stirring, for 1 to        2    minutes. Remove bay leaf.    Meanwhile, line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry. When meat mixture is  lukewarm, spoon into pie shell and cover with remaining pastry. Trim  pastry, seal edges and cut steam vents in top crust. Decorate with pastry  cutouts as desired. Bake in preheated 425 deg F oven for 15 minutes, then  reduce heat to 375 deg F and bake another 25 minutes or until crust is  golden.
