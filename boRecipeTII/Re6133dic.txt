Form the meatloaf mixture into a 9x5 inch loaf.*  Top the meatloaf with the remaining half-jar of pizza or spaghetti sauce  and the sliced olives. Bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until done. Let the  meatloaf sit for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.    NOTES : Turkey sausage is available in the deli section of most  supermarkets.
