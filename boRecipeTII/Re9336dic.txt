Puffs or Eclairs
Recipe pate a choux, Egg beaten with 1 teaspoon, 
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment. Pipe out  1/2-inch balls for profiteroles or cocktail puffs, 1-inch balls for cream  puffs, or 1/2 by 4-inch strips for eclairs. Be sure to leave enough room in  between for them to triple in size. Brush with egg glaze and bake for 15  minutes. Lower heat to 400 and open oven door briefly to let steam out.  Close the door and continue to bake another 1030 minutes according to their  size. They must be well dried out or they may fall. Take one out of the  oven and check it by breaking open and checking the interior walls: they  should be dry, not wet and eggy. Return to the oven as necessary. Remove  when done and cool on a wire rack. Yield: Approximately 30 medium puffs or  18 eclairs Baked puffs and eclairs freeze well for up to a month. Filling  Puffs: Either slice open horizontally, spoon filling onto bottom, and  replace the hat; or pierce a small hole with a paring knife in side or  bottom of the puff and pipe in a soft filling using a pastry bag with a  small plain tip.
