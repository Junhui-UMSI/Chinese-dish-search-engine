Apple Pie with Kuzu-Apple Juice Glaze
CRUST (FOR 8INCH PIE, Kuzu, Apple juice, Raisins, Cinnamon; optional, Corn oil, Barley malt, Whole wheat pastry flour, Sea salt, Lemon juice, Apples; thinly sliced, 
Prepare crust first by mixing salt into the fresh pastry flour, then adding  oil until flour begins to bead. Sprinkle barley malt over this mixture,  slightly mix, and add enough water to make a thick ball of dough. Quickly  roll out between two sheets of wax paper or on a board used for pie crusts.  Cut into a circle which is about 9-inches wide and place into lightly oiled  glass or stainless steel pie pan. Pierce the bottom of the pie crust and  sides lightly with a fork so the crust will not puff up and let the liquid  from the pie filling go under it.    Meanwhile, combine apples, 1/3 cup of apple juice and raisins and bring to  a boil. Cover and simmer 15 minutes. Mix in cinnamon and lemon juice.  Remove from heat and allow to cool. Combine kuzu and remaining 1 cup of  apple juice, stir until dissolved, and bring to a boil. Simmer about 1  minute or until transparent and thickened. Spoon apples into crust and pour  glaze over. Bake for about 40 minutes. ]]    Formatted by suechef@sover.net    NOTES : Pies originated in England as meat pies.
