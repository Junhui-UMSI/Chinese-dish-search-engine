Bears Bastardized Western Nc Bbq Sauce
Ketchup, Salt, Apple cider vinegar, Black Pepper, Dark brown sugar, Texas Pete Hot Sauce, 
dump into a blender and blend the piss outa it.    Its good to let it sit overnight, allows the flavors to meld.    It will settle out while it sits around(during dinner), so stir often.    Playing with the amounts of anything completely change the taste, so  experiment!!    Recipe by: Bear    Posted to bbq-digest by "Randy & JoAnne" <flog68@altamaha.net> on Mar 30,  1998
