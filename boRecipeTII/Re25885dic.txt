In a large bowl, combine potatoes, celery and 6 eggs. Add salt, pepper and  onion powder. Toss lightly to cut. In a small bowl combine mayonnaise,  vinegar and mustard. Mix well. Pour a little at a time over potato mixture  (size of potatoes used determines if you use all the dressing; usually it  takes all). Relish or green peppers may be added now; mix well.
