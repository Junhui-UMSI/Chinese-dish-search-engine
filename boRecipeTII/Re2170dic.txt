1. Heat oven to 500 degrees.    2. Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and  asparagus. Blanch until asparagus is bright green and tender, about 3  minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and set aside. Season well with salt and  pepper.    3. Break eggs into a bowl and lightly beat with a whisk or fork. Season  with salt and pepper. Add half of the chopped mint. Add a heaping  tablespoon of Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine.    4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in each of two 10-inch oven-proof nonstick  skillets, over medium heat. (Note: This recipe can also be prepared in one  12-inch nonstick skillet. Follow the cooking instructions for Martha?s  Ricotta & Herb Frittata.) Rotate the skillets to coat all sides with olive  oil. Divide the egg mixture equally among the skillets and reduce heat to  low. Cook, loosening the eggs at the sides from time to time using a rubber  spatula. The eggs will be slightly runny.    5. Add 4 asparagus spears to each skillet in a fan pattern. Divide the  remaining Parmesan. Sprinkle over eggs and asparagus. Transfer to a 500  degree oven and bake until just set, about 30 seconds. Using a rubber  spatula, loosen the frittata from the pan and transfer to a warm plate.  Garnish with the remaining chopped mint. Serve in wedges.
