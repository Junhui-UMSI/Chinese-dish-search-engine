"New Orleans Cooks The Italian Way" Locovozzi &  Mollicone (note: this is a real recipe and there is a whole Italian area of  New Orleans which as you can see is spicy like cajun, but truely Italian. I  have though of ways to make this with some other meat, because we just  dont have alligators in Milwaukee! Maybe buffalo?)
