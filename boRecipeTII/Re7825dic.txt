from The Versatile Grain and the Elegant Bean    On a vacation trip through northern Portugal, we became addicted to this  hearty peasant soup, so much so that we bought some Portuguese cabbage  seeds* to grow in our garden, giving us a steady supply of leaves solely  for this soup. Collard greens or kale are two green, leafy vegetables that  approximate the flavor of Portuguese cabbage.    Pierce the sausage, cover with water in a saucepan a bring to a boil Then  lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes to remove excess fat. Drain,  discard the water, slice the sausage into 3/4-inch slices and reserve.    In a 7-quart Dutch oven, heat the oil, add the onions and garlic and stir,  sauteeing for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and add the potatoes, stirring, and  cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a boil, then lower the  heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.    Crush the potatoes lightly in the pot using a potato masher. Add the  shredded greens and simmer for 15 minutes more. Add the cooked beans and  reserved sausage and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot. The soup can  be prepared a day or 2 in advance. Like most hearty soups or stews, the  flavors intensify with time    * Portuguese cabbage seeds are available through Le Jardin du Gourmet,  Danville, VT 05873.    ** Baking potatoes should not be used. They disintegrate too easily rather  than retaining their shape when lightly crushed.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by Cairn Rodrigues <cairnann@yahoo.com> on Feb  16, 1998
