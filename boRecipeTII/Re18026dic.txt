Note: You may substitute .33 cup soy sauce (dont add water) for the  barley miso, and seitan for the tofu     Heat the 2 tablespoons of sesame or canola oil in a medium saucepan.     Saute the mushrooms, onion, bell pepper and garlic with the basil for 5-8  min.  Stir in the dissolved miso.  Add the tomato puree, water,black pepper  and optional tomatoes.  Simmer for 5 min.     Pour the tamari evenly over the tofu.  Marinate about 10 min.  Heat the  0.25 cup sesame oil in a skillet.  Saute the tofu on both sides until  golden brown, 2-3 min.     Put a bit of the sauce in a baking dish 8 inches square.  Put the tofu on  the top; cover with the rest of the sauce.  Cover the dish.  Bake at 350  degrees for 20-25 min.  Serve with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable or  over noodles.     Note: This recipe, developed by Ron Pickarski, was given to me in a  newspaper clipping by a co-worker.  Rather than tofu, I used seitan that I  had bought in the produce section of the grocery store. It is a relatively  quick meal to put together that even my carnivorous roommate enjoys. As  this is one of only two recipes using seitan that I have, I should  appreciate anyone sharing others that they may have.  :-)    KATHLEEN.G.KIDD@DARTMOUTH.EDU    (KATHLEEN G.
