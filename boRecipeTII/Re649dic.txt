Heres a delicious soup from "Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish"    In a large saucepan, combine onion and veg broth. Bring to a simmer,  covered, over moderated heat and simmer until onion is softened, about 5  minutes.    Put 1/2 cup corn in a small bowl with chilies and pimiento. Stir to  combine.    Add remaining 2 1/2 cups corn and the milk to the onion. Bring to a boil.  Cover, adjust heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until corn is tender,  about 5 minutes. Cool slightly, then puree in blender or food processor  until smooth. Return soup to pot. Stir in corn/chile/pimiento mixture.  Reheat gently, season to taste with salt & pepper. Add a pinch of cayenne  if desired.
