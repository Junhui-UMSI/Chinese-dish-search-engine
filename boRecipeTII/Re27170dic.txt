Timpano or Timbalo
Italian sausages, Zucchini, Penne, Plum tomatoes, Eggs, Phyllo dough, fresh parmesan cheese, Eggplants, Yellow squash, Bulbs fennel, marinara sauce, Eggs, 
Preparation:    1. Oil the pan or wash-basin generously with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil so  that the phyllo dough will not stick. Line the pan with phyllo dough,  leaving at least 6" overlay to drape the timpano.    2. Layer the filling as you would with lasagne, but press down with your  hands so the timpano will hold and it will be well defined.    3. Add lightly sauced penne about 2" or so. Add various grilled vegetables  in a single layer.    4. Sprinkle with Parmesan and drizzle about 3/4 cup of marinara sauce over  the first layer.    5. Add 1/2 of the hard-boiled eggs, cut-side down.    6. Repeat layers until pan is filled.    7. Add beaten eggs which will set the timpano. Fold overlay over bottom of  timpano.    8. Bake on middle rack of 350 degree oven for 1 1 1/2 hours until crust is  golden. Check timpano after 45 minutes. If the top layer is cooking too  rapidly, lightly cover with foil.    9. The recipe may be altered with the ingredients of your choice.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #325 by roy@indy.net (Roy) on Dec 15, 1997
