Nutmeg, White vinegar, Shortening, White flour, Cinnamon, Sugar, Molasses, Salt, Ginger, 
Beat shortening till fluffy.  Add sugar & continue to beat until well  combined.  Add the rest of the ingredients in order, beating well after  each addition. When the ingredients are well mixed, wrap the mixture in  waxed paper & refrigerate for 1 hour to make the dough easier to handle. On  a floured board, roll out the dough until it is about an 1/8 inch thick.  Using a cookie cutter, cut into cookies & place on a cookie sheet. Bake 8  to 10 minutes at 275F. Cool for a couple of minutes on the sheet & then  remove to a wire rack to cool.
