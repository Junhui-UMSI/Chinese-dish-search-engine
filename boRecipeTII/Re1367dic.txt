Easy Swiss Steak
To 2 pounds bottom round or, DelMonte Stewed Tomatoes, 
Seasoned flour Optional: approx 1 lb carrots, sliced and added with the  other ingredients.    Cut steak into serving sized pieces.  Remove all visible fat.  Dredge in  seasoned flour.  (most recipes call for pounding the flour into the beef,  this is REALLY optional, cause Ive skipped it, and couldnt tell the  difference)    Spray cast iron skillet with cooking spray, heat to medium high.  brown  steak pieces well.  Add tomatoes and 1/2 can bouillon.  Cover tightly and  simmer over low heat until steak is fork tender.  (1 1/2 to 2 hours.)    Serve with mashed potatoes.
