opped    Cook rice according to package directions.  Set aside. Pour boiling water  over apricots; let stand 20 minutes to soften. Drain. Saute green onions,  mushrooms, and green pepper in butter until tender. Stir in rice, apricots,  pecans, parsley, and seasonings. Remove strings and slice roast in half  lengthwise, if not purchased sliced.  Slice pork pieces lengthwise in half  again, slicing to but not through one side. Lay pieces side by side, and  spoon stuffing mixture evenly over pork. Beginning with 1 long side, roll  pork jellyroll fashion, and tie securely with heavy string at 2 inch  intervals.  Place roast on a lightly greased rack in a shallow roasting  pan.  Place bacon lengthwise over roast.  Insert meat thermometer into  thickest part of roast, making sure it does not touch fat or stuffing.  Place an aluminum foil tent over roast. Bake at 325F for 3 hours or until  meat thermometer registers 160F (30-35 minutes per pound). Remove foil for  the last 30-40 minutes of baking. Remove roast from oven; let stand 5  minutes.   Remove string; slice and garnish with apricot halves and parsley, if  desired. Yield: 12 to 15 servings. From Southern Living Cookbook
