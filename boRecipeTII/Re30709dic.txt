Rub slits with  salt & pepper & stuff with mint. Season cavity with salt & pepper.    3. Place fish in roasting pan & brush all over with Tamarind glaze. Bake  until thickest part of fish flakes easily when tested with fork & the skin  is crisp. This should take 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on size of fish.

NOTES : Fish, deep fried or baked & served with some manner of sweet & sour  sauce, is one of the most ordered dishes in Thai resaurants in the US.  While    at many restaurants the sauce is purveyed from bottles, here the authentic    glaze for the crispy fish is a delicate combination of honey & fruity-tart    tamarind. The versatile glaze is delicious with grilled or baked poulty,  fish    or meat. Give it a try next time youre roasting a duck!
