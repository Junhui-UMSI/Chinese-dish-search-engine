Tropical Cakes with Golden Mango Sauce
Unsweetened coconut milk, Pure vanilla extract, Ripe mango, Diced fresh mango, garnish, Sugar, All purpose flour, Shredded coconut, Unsalted butter, melted, Eggs, Golden mango sauce, recipe, Dark rum, Baking Powder, 
Peel the mango and slice it in half lengthwise to remove the fruit from the  pit. Cut each half lengthwise into thin slices and then cut the slices  crosswise in half; set aside.    In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and baking powder. In  another bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, eggs, melted butter, rum,  and vanilla extract. Pour the liquid ingredients and mix with the whisk,  stopping when everything is just combined. (Dont worry if the batter is a  bit lumpy.) With a rubber spatula, gently but thoroughly fold in the  shredded coconut.    If necessary, lightly butter, oil, or spray your griddle or skillet.  Preheat over medium heat or, if using an electric griddle, set to 350  degrees F. If you want to hold the pancakes until serving time, preheat  your oven to 200 degrees F.    Spoon 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake, allowing space  for spreading. Arrange a few slices of mango on each pancake. (If you have  an leftover mango slices, you can dice them and use them for garnish.) When  the underside of the pancakes are golden and the tops are speckled with  bubbles that pop and stay open, flip the pancakes over with a wide spatula  and cook until the other sides are light brown. Serve immediately, or keep  the finished pancakes in the preheated oven while you make the rest of the  batch.    Yield: 14 pancakes    NOTES : Cooking live    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8852 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #546 by  Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Apr 3, 1997
