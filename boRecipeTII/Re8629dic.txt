Potica Pt 2
See part 1, 
the dough is in the flour.  Use only high-quality, fine grain wheat flour,  very dry (traditionally, flour was kept in a warm corner on the top of  Slovenian traditional bread oven -- to keep it dry and warm for use). Make  sure that the flour is warmed up -- making good potica requires a bit of  suffering: you should prepare it in a very hot kitchen, otherwise the yeast  or the dough may "catch cold" and the potica wont rise properly.
