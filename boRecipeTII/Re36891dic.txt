Hull and slice four cups strawberries; combine with 1/4 cup sugar, and  chill.    Combine next four ingredients; cut in butter with a pastry blender until  the mixture resembles coarse meal. Combine half-and-half and egg, stirring  well; add to flour mixture, stirring just until well moistened. Spread  mixture in a lightly greased 8" square baking pan. Bake at 450 for 15  minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes; turn out onto a wire rack.    Cut shortcake into 6 pieces; slice each piece crosswise in half. Place  bottom half of shortcake, cut side up, on an individual serving plate; top  with a dollop of whipped cream and 2-1/2 tablespoons of strawberry mixture.  Add second layer of shortcake; cut side down; top with a dollop of whipped  cream and 2-1/2 tablespoons of strawberry mixture. Garnish with an  additional dollop of whipped cream.  Add a whole strawberry for garnish.  Repeat for each shortcake.                                        per Southern Living magazine
