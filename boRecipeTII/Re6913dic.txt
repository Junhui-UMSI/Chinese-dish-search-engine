Notes: at Pancho and Leftys -- A Mexican Cantina, 2000 Washington St., Two  Rivers, WI.    To make salsa, combine fruits, jalapenos, onion, cilantro, cinnamon, chili  powder and 2 tablespoons reserved pineapple liquid. Toss well and chill at  least 2 hours.    To make fajitas, combine remaining ingredients except chicken and  tortillas. Marinate chicken strips in mixture 10 minutes. Remove chicken  strips from marinade and place in heated skillet over medium heat. Cook 5  to 8 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, brushing occasionally with  reserved marinade.    While chicken is cooking, heat tortillas on stove top or in microwave oven  until soft and pliable.    To assemble: Transfer cooked chicken to one side of small, hot, oiled  cast-iron skillet. Skillet should be hot enough that when chicken and salsa  are added they sizzle. Put chicken on one side, salsa on the other.  Immediately remove from heat and serve while still sizzling with three  warmed tortillas per person, rice and refried beans. Makes 4 servings.    Debora Jones, owner, sent the recipe.
