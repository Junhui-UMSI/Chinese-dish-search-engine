Armenian Vermicelli Pilaf
Chicken broth, Olive Oil, Vermicelli, Rice, Salt, 
Saute rice and vermicelli; stirring constantly, in olive oil or butter in  nonstick pan until rice is translucent, about 2 minutes. Combine rice and  vermicelli with broth in steaming pan; season to taste. Cover and steam  until rice is done, 18 to 20 minutes. Uncover and allow to dry out, 3 to 5  minutes. Fluff with fork before serving.    Variations: * Turkish cooks sometimes chop and add the white parts of a few  scallions at the end of the steaming step.    * Substitute 1/2 cup fine egg noodles for vermicelli.    NOTES : This popular dish is used interchangeably with plain rice pilaf.  Especially good with chicken and lamb stews.  Recipe by: The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Betty L.
