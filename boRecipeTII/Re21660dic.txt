Divide dough in half and refrigerate several hours or overnight  till firm.    Roll out one piece and dough and line a greased 8 x 13 pan with it (make  sure the dough reaches the tops of the sides).  Sprinkly the graham cracker  crumbs over the bottom.    Mix apples with the cinnamon and sugar and fill the crust.  Tope with the  second piece of dough and seal the edges.  Use a fork to poke holes  randomly over the top to let steam escape. If desired you can brush the top  with melted butter and a light dusting of sugar.    Bake at 400 degrees  for one hour or until deep golden brown.
