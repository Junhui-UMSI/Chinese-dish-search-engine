Make topping first: Mix flour, 1/2 cup white sugar and baking powder. Add  milk and 1/4 cup butter. Stir until all lumps are gone. Set aside.    Next, in a medium saucepan, stir together brown sugar and cornstarch; add  water. Add peaches and blueberries. Cook and stir gently over medium heat  until bubbly. Add lemon juice and 1 tablespoon butter and stir until butter  melts. Pour in an ungreased baking dish and spoon mounds of topping over  the hot filling. Sprinkle with mixture of remaining white sugar, nutmeg and  cinnamon. To avoid spillover in the oven, place baking dish on top of a  cookie sheet. Bake cobbler in a 350F oven for 35 minutes or until a  toothpick inserted in the crust comes out clean. Serve warm with ice cream,  or if you are feeling frisky, whipped cream. If blueberries are not  available, you can add one additional cup of peaches to the recipe.    NOTES : According to the author, Marilyn Schiveley, of Folsom, its a  "killer" because its so good. "Its to die for," she said. "My aunt and  uncle had a peach ranch in Colorado back in the 1950s, and this is a tried  and true, never-fail recipe that gets rave reviews every time."
