Rebekahs Favorite Hot Crab Dip
Stick butter or margerine, Velvetta cheese, (small) white crab meat,, Breadsticks or crackers, 
1. In top of double boiler, melt the margerine or butter with the cheese.  Stir until smooth and well blended. (You dont have to watch it; just put  it in the double boiler and let it melt.)    2. Fold in the crab meat. Spoon into a chafing dish.    3. Serve hot with crackers or breadsticks. Makes about 3 cups of dip.    Personal Note: This recipe was given to me by Sharon MacBlane who used to  teach Home. Ec. at my school. Ive used it many, many times because of its  simplicity and economy. The dip will get thicker as it sits in the chafing  dish. Ive also used a small crockpot for it. If any dip is left over, it  can be thinned with a little milk and served over toast points.
