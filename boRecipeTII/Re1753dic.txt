Chewy Breadmachine Bagels
Salt, water, Yeast, All-purpose flour, Sugar, 
Especially for Jan (nice to see you posting!) here are two of the recipes  from Veggies Unite! that seem to fit the bill.    Place ingredients in your bread machine. Select dough or manual cycle. When  cycle is finished, remove the dough from the machine and roll into 6 snakes  about a 10 inches long. Press the ends tightly together to form a doughnut  shape. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place bagels in the boiling  water for 2 minutes. (The longer they boil the chewier they are.) Remove  from the water and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350  degrees for 20 minutes until golden in color.    Try: half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour. Add a teaspoon of  cinnamon, 1/4 cup of raisins and an extra tablespoon of sugar for Cinnamon  Raisin Bagels    Serves: 6 Bagels    Posted to fatfree digest by RubyTues59@aol.com on Oct 4, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.
