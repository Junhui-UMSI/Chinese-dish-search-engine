In a heavy saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the tomatillos, 3/4 of  the sliced onion, 6 of the chiles, and 6 of the garlic cloves. Simmer the  mixture covered for about 30 minutes, or until the tomatillos are tender.  Cool slightly and transfer to a blender or food processor. Add the  remaining onion, chiles, and garlic, cilantro, and salt. Puree the mixture.  Preheat the oven to its lowest heat and heat a wellseasoned flat griddle  pan or castiron skillet over medium heat. Brush each slice of cheese with a  little oil, then grill the slices for about 20 seconds on each side. You  will need a heavy metal spatula to turn them, scraping all the golden crust  from the pan and flipping it over. You will have to grill the cheese in  batches, transferring the cooked cheeses to a platter in the oven while you  finish cooking, but do not let the cheese melt. Place 2 slices of cheese on  each of 6 warmed appetizer plates, pour the hot tomatillo sauce over the  top and serve immediately, garnished with sprigs of cilantro and charred  scallions. Accompany with wedges of toasted country bread.
