Zucchini Omelette (Kolokithakea Me Avga)
olive oil, Zucchini, Onion, Oregano, Salt & pepper, Egg, 
Heat oil until hot; fry zucchini and onions until zucchini is tender and  onions are soft. Season with a dash of oregano and salt and pepper to  taste.   Pour the beaten eggs over zucchini, lifting the edges of zucchini  cubes so the eggs run evenly over them. Cook slowly, running spatula around  edges and lifting egg mixture to allow uncooked portion to flow underneath.  Cook until eggs are firm, and slide onto a serving platter.   Serve with a  plate of tomato wedges and slices of feta cheese.
