Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 20 minutes    Coat a waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray and preheat. Combine flours,  sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Make a well in  the center of the flour mix. Whisk the egg whites, buttermilk, margarine  and vanilla in another bowl. Pour egg white mixture into flours well,  stirring until just blended. Fold in half each of the raspberries,  blackberries and blueberries. Spoon about 1 cup of the batter onto the hot  waffle iron. Close and cook until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Repeat,  coating iron with nonstick spray between each batch. Keep waffles warm in a  250 F (120 C) oven until all are cooked. Divide waffles onto 4 plates. Top  each with equal amounts of remaining berries and a strawberry.    Variation: You can use the batter to make pancakes, and instead of mixing  the fruit in the batter use it as a topping only.
