Especially for Jan (nice to see you posting!) here are two of the recipes  from Veggies Unite! that seem to fit the bill.    Combine the yeast and 1 cup of the flour. In a seperate bowl, combine  water, 3 T of sugar and salt. Add to flour mixture. Stir in raisins, 1 T of  sugar, and cinnamon, if using. Beat with electric mixer or stir vigourously  until no lumps remain and the mixture is sort of splashy. Add the raisins  and remaining flour. Mix until dough is tough. Turn out on floured surface  and knead for 6-8 minutes. Cover and let rise for ten to fifteen minutes.    Oil or spray a large cookie sheet. Divide the dough into 12 to 24 portions,  rolling each into a ball and pulling a hole through in the middle with your  fingers. [OR roll into a snake and press the ends together, which is the  traditional way.] Place the bagels on the cookie sheet, cover and let rise  in a warm place for at least 20 minutes and no more than 2 hours (or youll  have dough coming out of your ears).    Meanwhile, put one gallon of water and one tablespoon of sugar in a large  pot to boil; reduce to simmering. Cook bagels, 4 or 5 at a time for 4 to 7  minutes (depending on the toughness of the skin you prefer - the longer  they boil, the tougher they get), turning once. Preheat oven to 375 degrees  F. Mix the brown sugar, molasses, and non-dairy milk. Drizzle onto the  bagels for a sweeter taste. Bake the bagels for 31 minutes, or until golden  brown.
