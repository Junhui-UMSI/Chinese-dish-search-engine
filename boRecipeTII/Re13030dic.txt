Soup tastes creamy and butter rich due to the smooth bits of crab and the  puree with nfdm powder. Cilantro does not dominate; it surprises. I used  Sharwoods mild curry. Serve as appetizer or entree. The homemade vegetable  broth had much character. (220 cals, 3.7 g fat without cheese; 272, 7.8  with)  * Heat peanut oil in heavy bottom soup pot over moderately hot burner; add  the onion; season with a few cranks of salt and pepper; saute, stirring  often.  * Add cubed squash, cubed potatoes and carrot pieces.  Stir to coat well  with oil. Add the broths and optional chicken bouillon. Add herbs and  spices. Bring slowly just to a boil; partially cover and simmer for about  45 minutes, stirring ocassionally. The chunks should be ready to puree.  * Puree about 1/2 of the soup. Add milk powder to the puree. Return the  puree to the pot. Add hoisin sauce, and finely flaked crab meat. Simmer  about 5 minutes to warm the crab. Taste and correct seasoning, if  necessary. Just before serving, stir in the roughly chopped or snipped  cilantro.
