Mix 1 c flour and remaining ingredients in food processor; beat 1 min. Add  flour gradually and process until dough leaves the side of the container.  Place in greased bowl, turn to grease top, and cover with plastic wrap. Let  rise in refrigerator overnight. Divide dough in thirds. Press with heel of  hand onto greased pizza pan until crust fills pan. (Unless, of course, you  are talented enough to toss it into the air.) Bake in 350F oven for 5  minutes.  Freeze. When ready to make pizza, remove from freezer and quickly  cover with pizza sauce and toppings. Bake on oven rack without pan.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/kids.zip
