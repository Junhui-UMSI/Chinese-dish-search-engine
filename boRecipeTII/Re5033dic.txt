* available in Asian markets or natural foods stores, or use white vinegar    A vinegar made from umeboshi plums lends the vegetables a rosy hue, that  contrasts with green lettuce leaves.    In a medium bowl, toss together the radishes, cucumber, carrot and salt.  Let sit at room temperature 2 hours.    Press vegetables gently in a colander, to drain off liquid. Return  vegetables to bowl.    In a saucepan, bring the vinegar and water to a boil. Cool, then pour over  vegetables. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 24 hours.    To serve, arrange chilled pickled vegetables on lettuce leaves.    From an article by Mary Carroll in The San Mateo Times, 5/25/93.
