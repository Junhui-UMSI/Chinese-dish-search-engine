Wash, core and seed the green peppers and cut into long thin strips. In a  deep casserole, put both vinegars, the sugar, salt and halved garlic  cloves. Bring to a strong boil, then add the green peppers and cook for 10  minutes. Remove the peppers from the liquid and place on paper towels to  dry. Put a layer of green peppers into a glass jar and cover with some  chopped garlic, a pinch of capers, a few small anchovy pieces and a few  basil leaves. Add a second layer of green peppers and repeat the process  until all the ingredients have been used. Top with basil. Add fresh oil, a  little at a time, pressing the jar contents down with your fingers to force  the oil well down into the jar and thoroughly coat all the ingredients. At  least 1/2-inch of oil must cover the top and any air pockets must be  eliminated. Seal the jar hermetically and store in a cool dark place for 20  days.
