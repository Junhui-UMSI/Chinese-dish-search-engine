William Oreillys Brine
Salt, Dried oregano; thyme, and, Sugar, Soy sauce, Water, 
I just pulled my first brined turkey of the smoker. I have always rubbed  with kosher salt. Used William OReillys brine for 16 hours. The skin is  salty and crisp. I should have taken it off at 170 and let it rise but I  didnt. Took it off at 180. The meat is tender, moist and not salty. The  texture of the meat was affected much deeper than with a rub. If you dont  want salt, dont eat the skin.    I used brown sugar and will try Tamari sauce instead of soy next time.
