Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.     To make the cakes: Combine chocolate, milk, brown sugar and 1 egg yolk  in the top of the double boiler. Cook, stirring constantly, over hot water  until smooth. Remove from heat.      Sift the flour with the baking soda and salt into a medium bowl.      Beat the butter in the large bowl of an electric mixer until light.  Slowly beat in the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the two remaining egg  yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Slowly add  the chocolate mixture.      Combine the tomato sauce, cream and vanilla in a small bowl. Add to the  batter in thirds, alternating with thirds of the flour mixture.      Beat the egg whites until stiff; fold into the batter.      Pour the batter into prepared pans. Bake until a toothpick inserted in  the centre comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before  unmolding.      FROSTING: Combine water, corn syrup and sugar in a medium saucepan.  Heat to boiling; boil until the mixture thickens and forms a ball when a  small spoonful is dropped into cold water (about 240F on a candy  thermometer).      Beat the egg whites in a large bowl of the electric mixer until stiff.  Slowly beat in the hot syrup. Combine to beat until spreading consistency.  Beat in orange juice and vanilla. Spread over bottom layer, the sides and  tops of cake. SERVES 8-10    SOURCE:_As American as Apple Pie_    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
