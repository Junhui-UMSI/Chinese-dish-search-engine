Place apples in concentric circles, slightly  overlapping, over pecans.    Cake: Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt into bowl.    Using electric mixer, beat butter at medium speed until light and  fluffy. add sugar and continue beating until creamy, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add egg and vanilla and continue beating until completely  incorporated.    Reduce speed to low, add flour mixture and milk, alternating in 3  additions.  Continue to mix only until dry ingredients are completely  mixed in, stopping to scrape sides if necessary.    Spoon cake batter over topping and spread carefully so batter is even.  Bake at 325F. until tester comes out clean, about 55 minutes.    Cool in pan 10 to 15 minutes.  Carefully run spatula around edge of  pan and let stand another 10 to 15 minutes. Invert pan over large  plate and let stand about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pan.  Serve  warm with fresh whipped cream.
