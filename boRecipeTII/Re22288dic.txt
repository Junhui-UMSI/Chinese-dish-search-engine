Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com>    >From Portland?s Palette, A Collection of Recipes from the City of Roses,  The Junior League of Portland, Oregon, 1992    This is that gorgeous cookbook (displayed with pride in every cooking/food  related store here in Portland) with the watercolors of Portland scenes  throughout. The cover has watercolor of Portland?s Rose Garden with view of  Mount Hood off in the distance. (The Rose Garden does, actually, have a  gorgeous view of Mount Hood.) Every cook here, I think, longs for this  book. I finally could stand it no more, and bought it--$19.95. It?s the  kind of book that you see displayed in model kitchens--so pretty, so  special to us in Portland.
