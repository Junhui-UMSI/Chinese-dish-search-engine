douglas allen thompson <aesculus@TSO.UC.EDU>    Take the chicken and steak and slightly freeze them so that cutting the  meat into thin 1/2" strips is easier. Trim off any fat or chicken skin.    In a large glass bowl or casserole make the marinade (mix all ingredients).  Put the meat in this and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to sit in the  fridge overnight or make this early in the morning for the evening meal.    Remove meat from marinade prior to grilling. Discard the marinade and Do  Not Re-use. Once meat has drained place the beef on the hot grill first,  laying the strips perpendicular to the grill rods,spokes,etc. otherwise the  meat falls into the fire. After you get the beef on add the chicken the  same way. The meat will cook quickly and you only need to flip it once.As  the beef and chicken cook add the shrimp. The shrimp may cook so fast that  you dont have to turn it.    When the shrimp curls up and goes pink its done.Remove all the meat from  the grill and serve with grilled onions and green pepper slices.(These can  be made ahead of time and kept warm.) Serve meat and grilled vegetables  with large flour tortillas that have been heated up. Top with sour  cream,salsa,or, if you wish, Melindas.    One suggestion: This works best if one person works the grill and starts to  turn meat while someone else is adding the meat to the grill.  Everything  cooks fast and this is something that you dont want to overcook.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
