IN skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and garlic.  Cook, stirring often, 7 to 10 minutes or until most of the liquid has  evaporated. In a bowl, blend together zucchini mixture, ricotta, Cheddar,  egg, oregano, basil, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Refrigerate while rolling out  the dough.    DIVIDE dough into 4 portions and shape into balls. On lightly floured  surface, roll or stretch each ball into an 8-inch circle. Divide filling  among dough rounds; fold dough over to make half-circles, leaving enough  dough on the bottom edge to fold over top edge. Crimp edges to seal (it may  be easier to fill and form soft calzone right on the baking sheet).    BAKE on greased baking sheet in 425F oven for about 20 minutes or until  golden brown.    * Calzones are baked pizza-dough turnovers. Buy ready-to-bake pizza    dough in plastic bags in the refrigerator or freezer sections of many    supermarkets. The weight may vary -- if you have more than you need,    cut off the extra and freeze to make pizza later. Serve calzones warm    or at room temperature with a tossed salad.
