CUT THE BEEF into 1/4-inch thick by 1 1/2-inch long by 1/2-inch wide  slices; put into a bowl and toss with the beef marinade. Set aside. Cover  the black beans with water until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse off  excess salt with water. Place in a small bowl and mash together with garlic  and ginger into a coarse paste; set aside. Separate the strands of rice  noodles. Set aside. Over high heat, preheat the wok until hot. Add half the  oil and swirl it to coat the sides. When the oil is hot, add the beef; toss  until the beef loses its redness, about 30-to-45 seconds.    Remove to a bowl; set aside. Add remaining oil to wok. While the oil is  warming add the black bean mixture; stir-fry until fragrant, about 10  seconds. Over high heat, add the onions and peppers; stir-fry until they  begin to soften but are still crisp, about 1 minute. Add the rice noodles;  stir-fry to coat the strands with seasoned oil, about 30 seconds. Add the  white pepper, sugar and soy sauce; toss until evenly distributed. Return  the beef; toss a few turns to mix in. Transfer to a serving platter. Serve  immediately.
