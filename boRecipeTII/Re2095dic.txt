Fall is one of the favorite times of the year in The Kitchen of  Recipe-a-Day. The Cook & Kitchen Staff are busy with the fruits and  vegetables of the Fall harvest. Apples are one of the benefits of Fall,  even though many types are available year-round. Now is a great time to  stock up on our favorite autumnal fruit, the apple.    Just in case you didnt know, the apple is an excellent source of Vitamin  C. An apple alone is a natural sugary-sweet fruit treat, and remains low in  calories at about 70 per.    Todays recipe may be prepared with nearly any apple variety, although the  Kitchen Staff recommends a tart variety. Our favorite is the Winesap, but a  Granny Smith makes a fantastic contrast in todays oatmeal-based dessert.    Pre-heat oven to 350-F degrees and lightly spray a 9-inch by 13-inch  ovenproof baking pan with non-stick butter-flavored cooking oil, or coat  lightly with butter. Set aside.    In a large mixing bowl combine oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, granulated  sugar, and butter.    Blend together until the mixture is crumbly and the butter is well  distributed throughout.    Place the sliced apples in an even layer over the bottom of the prepared  baking dish.    Sprinkle the apples with about a half-teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of  salt, if desired.    Top the apple slices with the oatmeal mixture, and sprinkle the top with  another optional dash of salt and a bit of cinnamon.    Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Cool for at least 15 minutes prior  to serving. Great served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream; or cold,  cut into large squares. May be stored at room temperature in a covered  container for 3 to 5 days.
