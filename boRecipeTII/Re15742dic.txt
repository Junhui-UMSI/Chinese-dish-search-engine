The following four recipes are from a Chron article called "Foreign  Intrigue" by Alice Cuneo that featured recipes from various  consulates in the City.  This first one is from the Consulate of the  Peoples Republic of China.  Its a sophisticated (but uncomplicated)  banquet dish featuring abalone, shrimp and porkfat.    Abalone stuffed with minced shrimp, from Shen Xuliang of the Chinese  consulate.    Trim the abalone, removing rough parts, and cut into flat rounds. Chop  shrimp and fat pork to a paste consistency; stir in the water  chestnuts, chives and ginger water.  Season with salt and MSG.    Create the abalone "sandwiches" by spreading an abalone round with  shrimp paste, then topping with another round.  Dredge "sandwiches"  in maize flour and set aside.    Heat chive and ginger oil in a wok over medium heat, swirling the oil  to coat all sides of the wok.    Dip the abalone "sandwiches" in the flour, then in eggs.  Fry in the  hot oil until abalone is tender and golden.  Add Shaoxing wine,  chicken stock, salt and MSG.  Bring to a simmer, adjust the  seasonings and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.  Serve immediately.    NOTE:  Chive and ginger oil is oil in which chives and ginger have  been cooked.  To make at home, heat 4 ounces oil in a wok set over  medium heat. Toss in 1 or 2 tablespoons fresh snipped chives and 3  slices fresh ginger. Stir-fry until fragrant, then proceed with  recipe.  (Remove ginger slices before serving.)    Ginger water is available in Chinese markets.    From the San Francisco Chronicle, 6/15/88.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip
