1. To make the pasta, form a well in the middle of the flour. Add the eggs  and a pinch of salt, and with the fork, combine until the pasta forms a  smooth elastic ball. If too wet, add more flour.    2. To make the filling, blanch the broccoli and grind fine. Let it cool,  then combine with all ingredients, and season to taste with salt and  pepper.    3. To make tortellis, roll the pasta 1/8-inch thick and cut into 2-1/2 inch  circles. Place 1 TBS. of filling in the center, and fold into a 1/2 circle,  using egg white or water to seal if needed. Wrap around a finger; join  sides together and pinch closed. This will result in a hat-shaped pasta.    4. To cook the tortelli, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 TBS.  of salt. Add tortellis and cook until they rise to the top of the pot.  While they are cooking, reduce 2 cups of heavy cream until thick. Add 2  cups of tomato sauce and 1/4 lb. of butter. Toss the tortellis in the  sauce, add a handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and serve  immediately.
