Volcano
Vinegar, Clay -- modeling, Food coloring -- red, Baking soda, 
My favorite kiddy project is the classic baking soda and vinegar volcano.  Make a volcano out of play doh or modeling clay. In the crater put baking  soda and perhaps a little red food coloring. To display, pour vinegar in it  and watch it erupt!    Recipe By     :
