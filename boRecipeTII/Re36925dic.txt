Strawberry Squares
Strawberry jello, Sugar, Graham Wafer Crumbs, Crushed strawberries, Lemon juice, Butter, 
Mix the crumbs and butter to-gether and put all but 1/2 cup into a 8x8 pan  and cook 10-15 min. in moderate oven. In saucepan put the strawberries,  sugar and lemon juice, heat until hot and add the jello, bring to boil and  then take from stove and cool. Whip 1/2 pt. whipping cream until stiff and  add half to jello mixture. Pour over graham wafer base. To rest of cream  add some sugar and vanilla and spread over the other mixture, sprinkle the  reserved crumbs on top and chill in refrigerator. Very Good.
