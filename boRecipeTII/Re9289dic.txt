Plantains are good sliced and sauteed. Theyre also good substituted into  any recipe that uses cooked bananas. Many caribbean recipes that call for  banana originally called for plantain, but the recipe-writer thought you  wouldnt have access to plantain.    The recipe is a little heavy in the fat department, so I usually leave out  the meat, and skimp on the oil and butter. (I dont know how authentic the  veggie version is!) Also, the author wants us to boil the beans to death. I  have taken the liberty of changing that in the body of the recipe.    Use fresh or frozen green beans.    Peel the plantains, cut into 2-inch thick legthwise slices, and fry in oil  till golden brown. Remove, drain, and keep warm.    In a frying pan, saute the onion, green pepper, and garlic until soft but  not brown. Add the ground beef and fry at high heat for 3 minutes. Pour in  the tomato sauce and add the capers and olives, if desired. Cook 15 minutes  over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to  taste. Wash the string beans and steam till tender.    Beat the eggs, adding salt and pepper to taste. Butter the sides and bottom  of a round casserole and melt the remaining butter in the bottom.    Pour in *half* of the beaten eggs and cook over medium heat for about 1  minute or until slightly set. Cover the eggs with one-third of the plantain  slices, following with layers of half the ground meat and half the string  beans. Add another layer of plantains, the remainder of the ground beef,  another layer of beans, and top with plantains. Pour the rest of the beaten  eggs over the top.    Cook over low heat for 15 minutes, uncovered, being careful not to let the  omelette burn. Then place in a preheated 350-degree oven for 10 to 15  minutes to brown the top of the pin~on. Serve with rice and beans.    Excellent for lunch.
