I bought a hot sauce recently from a store  in Ottawa, Ontario from the importers Tan-Tos called Portugal Pili Pili,  product of Costa Rica. Its made with soya oil, lemon, vinegar, green  tobasco, pepper, salt, onion, starch, molasses, parsley, acetic acid (but  that is undiluted vinegar??), annatto, garlic, herbs. Not hot at all, I  taste the salt more than anything.    Whatever it is, I dont recommend it. It really has a processed taste, if  you know what I mean. Hey, Ive been to the FFF and I have tasted some  quality stuff! Im not willing to settle for some half-assed hot sauce  because I can get it in Canada for cheap.    Now, Jennifer Trainer has a recipe for Pili Pili, which she calls West  African...    Puree all together.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #309    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
