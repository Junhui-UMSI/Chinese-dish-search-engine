~-----------------------------FOR THE COATING------------------------------    4        sheets phyllo dough**        4 tb melted butter  :          more butter for the baking  :          -sheet      1/2 c  sesame seeds; toasted    ** (defrosted completely in the package; dont open the box until ready to  use)    For the marinade--Rinse the chicken breasts, pat them dry, and make a few  slashes in each. Combine the marinade ingredients in a nonreactive bowl and  add the chicken. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at  least 4 hours or overnight.    To coat and cook the chicken--Heat the oven to 450F and butter a baking  sheet. Butter a sheet of phyllo, top with another sheet, butter that and  repeat with the other two sheets. Cut the phyllo stack into 6 equal strips.  Follow the directions in the photos AT THE WEBSITE OR IN THE MAGAZINE for  wrapping the breasts and dipping the ends in the seeds.    Heres what it will tell you: Remove a breast from the marinade and let  some of the marinade drip off. Lay the breast at one end of a strip of  phyllo and roll it up, leaving the ends exposed.    Dip both ends of the chicken into the sesame seeds to coast. Put the  breast, phyllo seam down, on the buttered baking sheet; repeat with other  breasts. Brush the tops of the phyllo with butter before roasting.    Set the prepared breasts on a buttered baking sheet and roast them until  crisp, browned, and cooked through, 25 to 30 min.

Notes: These breasts have a crinkly, golden phyllo crust and a nutty flavor  from the toasted sesame seeds.
