Put butter over top in center of dish. Microwave at high for 2  minutes, or until smooth. If all butter has not melted in cooking, it will  as mixture is stirred. Blend in nuts. Pour into lightly-buttered 8x4x3"  dish. Chill 1 hour in refrigerator or 20 to 30 minutes in freezer. Cut into  squares. Makes about 36 squares.
