Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Thaw phyllo according to package directions.  Rinse and drain berries. In a large bowl, mix sugar, cornstarch and zest  together.

Add raspberry mixture  and brush overhanging phyllo with water. Flap overhang over berries to form  a package. Line a second 9- inch pie plate with one sheet of phyllo and  invert first pie plate with berries into second. Brush overhang with water  and fold over top. Continue lining empty pie plate with sheet of phyllo,  flip berry package into it, brush overhang with water and flap over top.  Use a total of about 8 sheets of dough. Wipe out empty pie plate and spray  with nonstick cooking spray. Layer 4 sheets phyllo, criss-crossed, in pie  plate. Brush all over with water. Flip berry package into center of pie  plate and gather up corners of phyllo, twisting into a ruffled topknot in  center. Brush over all with melted butter. Bake 30 minutes or until golden  brown and puffy. Serve dusted with powdered sugar.
