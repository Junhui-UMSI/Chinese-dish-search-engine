Barbecue Sauce
Worcestershire Sauce, Dry mustard, Chili powder, Brown sugar, Paprika, Tomato sauce, Chopped Green Onion Tops, Cayenne pepper, Vinegar, Salt, 
salt, paprika, mustard, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Simmer 15 minutes,  stirring occasionally.   Serve hot.  Makes 2 1/2 cups. ***** While there was no indication, I would  expect that this is best with Pork, since the idea of BBQ in that area  was nearly always pork.
