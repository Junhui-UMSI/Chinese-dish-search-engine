Baklava
Sugar, Sugar, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Butter, Water, Lemon juice, Pecans, Filo dough, 
* Prepare syrup first: bring to boil 2-1/2 cups sugar and water; add lemon  juice. Simmer until it is a pale yellow color. Syrup should be thick and  cold when poured over hot Baklava.    Mix nuts, 1/4 cup sugar, and spices; set aside. Butter 9" x 13" cake pan  thoroughly. Keep filo pastry covered with a damp tea towel while working  with individual sheets. Layer sheets in baking pan, one at a time, brushing  each layer with melted butter. After layering six or so, begin alternating  layers of filo pastry with nut mixture. Brush one layer with butter and  sprinkle the next with 1/2 cup nut mixture. Continue to alternate buttered  layers and nut-covered layers until all but ten of the sheets have been  used. Layer the last ten sheets as you did the bottom six, brushing each  with butter. Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Remove from oven and let  cool for five minutes. Score pastry into diamond shapes about 1-1/2" X 2".  Pour cold syrup over hot pastry. Allow to cool to room temperature before  cutting and removing from pan.
