Baby Back Ribs From Cincinnati
Salt and pepper, Baby Back Ribs, beer, Garlic powder, Barbecue sauce, 
Trim ribs of extra fat and bone chips. Rub salt, pepper, and garlic powder  completely over ribs. Grill 5 minutes on each side on a very hot grill  being careful not to let them get flamed if fat drips. Place in pan. Pour  beers (or 1 bottle of beer depending on amount of ribs) over them. Put foil  on top of the pan and seal tightly. Place in a 325 degree preheated oven 1  hour or until tender. Dark beer can be used and will alter the flavor  slightly. Allow to rest for 15 minutes to rest. Baste with your favorite  sauce and place on grill for 5 minutes on each side.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by mary curtis <curtism@FUSE.NET> on Apr 16, 1998
