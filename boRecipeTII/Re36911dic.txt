FOR THE SOUFFLE: Rinse, hull and puree the berries. Puree the berries in a  blender or food processor. Measure 2 cups puree. (Use any remaining puree  for the sauce.) Combine water and sugar in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to  a boil over low heat. Cook until the syrup thickens, about 3 minutes.  Increase heat and add puree, stirring to dissolve any sugar which may have  hardened when the puree was added. Bring to a boil and cool. Thirty minutes  before serving the souffle, preheat the oven to 400F and set a rack in the  lower part of the oven. Spray a 2 1/2-quart oval gratin dish or rectangular  glass baking dish with vegetable cooking spray and sprinkle the inside of  the dish with sugar. Whip the egg whites with the salt until they hold a  soft peak. Fold in the cooled strawberry puree. Pour the souffle batter  into the dish and smooth the top of the batter with a metal spatula. Bake  about 15 minutes, until well risen and lightly colored. Serve immediately.  FOR THE STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SAUCE: While the souffle is baking, combine the  sauce ingredients in the blender (adding any leftover puree) and puree.  Place in saucepan and bring to a boil and reduce for a minute or 2. Serve  with the souffle. Vary this souffle with other fruit or berries--use 2 cups  of pureed, strained fruit as a substitute for the strawberries.
