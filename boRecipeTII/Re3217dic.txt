Pear Brie Pizzette
All-Purpose Flour, (2 1/2 To, Sugar, Unsalted butter, DOUGH, Warm Water, Water, Salt, Dry Yeast, Not Rapid Rising, olive oil, Brie (1/2 To 3/4 Pound),, Yellow Onions, Pears, Ripe, Comice Pref., Cornmeal, Sugar, olive oil, TOPPING, 
Dough: Pour the water in a bowl and sprinkle the yeast on top. Add the  sugar, salt, olive oil, and mix until the yeast is dissolved. Add 1 1/2  cups of flour, stir, and add 1 more cup. Combine thoroughly and turn the  dough out onto a lightly floured surface, adding the rest of the flour if  the dough is too sticky. Knead for 5 minutes.    Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and let rise in a warm place until  double in bulk-- about 1 hour. Punch down and divide into two pieces for  pizzettes. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Using a rolling pin or your  hands, shape into two rounds.    Topping: Preheat the oven to 450F.    Slice the onions into thin rings and saute in the melted butter and oil  until limp. Cover the pan, stirring occaisionally. Cook slowly for about 15  minutes. Uncover the pan, sprinkle the onions with the sugar, turn up the  heat, and cook until well browned. Stir constantly. The sugar carmelizes  the onions. This will take 15 to 20 minutes. Set the onions aside.    Peel and slice the pears.    Brush the tops of the pizzettes, with some olive oil and pread the  carmelized onions over each. Arrange the pear slices on top and dot with  slices of the Brie.    Bake for 15 minutes on a lightly greased pizza pan on which you have  sprinkled cornmeal. The dough may also be baked on a cookie sheet and cut  into squares. Serves 4. More if used as a first course. >From the  collection of dianne@olynet.com    Recipe by: Katherine Hall Page  "The Body in The Cast"    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #486 by Dianne Ward <dianne@paccom.com> on  Feb 27, 1997.
