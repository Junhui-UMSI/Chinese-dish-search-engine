1. Mix the sugar with 1 tsp of the cinnamon. In a large bowl, beat the eggs  and sugar mixture together thoroughly. Beat in the oil, orange juice and  zest.    2. Mix the cake meal, potato starch, and remaining 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon  together. Add the matzo meal and almonds.    3. Mix all the dry ingredients into the egg batter to form a soft dough.    3. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate one hour or overnight.    5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the dough on a work surface and  shape it into a 1- inch cylinder. Cut into rolls approximately 6- inches  long. Place on a non-stick baking sheet.    6. Bake the rolls for 30 minutes or until lightly browned.    7. Cool slightly; slice the rolls diagonally into 1/2- inch slices and  place cut side up on the cookie sheet. Return to the oven and brown for 15  minutes.    8. Turn off the heat and let stand in oven until lightly browned and crisp.    VARIATION: A mixture of 2 tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon may be sprinkled  over the sliced rolls before returning to the oven. You may also just dust  lightly with powdered sugar before serving. (can make own)    Lindas note: As my family likes mandelbread on the cakier-side, I  underbaked these by almost 10 minutes. I then put the slices back in the  oven to toast for just a few minutes.
