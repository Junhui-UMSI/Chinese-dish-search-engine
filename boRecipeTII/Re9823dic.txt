Preheat oven to 350.    Prepare the pumpkin as though you were going to make a jack-o-lantern, but  stop short of carving the face. (cut off the top; remove the seeds and  stringy stuff.)    Place onion, bread, cheese, horseradish, and mustard inside the pumpkin.  Mix with your hands until well combined.    Add milk and broth (as much as will fit - you can adjust the amounts) along  with the seasonings. Stir it up.    Line the pumpkin lid with a piece of foil, and place it on top. Fill the  ungreased pumpkin in an ungreased baking pan.    Bake until the pumpkin is tender (about two hours). To test for tenderness,  remove the lid, and gently stick a fork into the side. It should go in  easily.    To serve: Scoop deeply to bring up some pumpkin pieces from the sides and  bottom along with the soup. If desired, top with some crunchy rye croutons.    NOTES : no kettle necessary! This wonderful filling soup gets baked right  inside the pumpkin, and the whole tureen can be brought to the table as an  edible centerpiece.  For the broth you can use homemade stock (p.3),  vegetable bouillon, or canned vegetable broth. Water will work if you are  brothless.
