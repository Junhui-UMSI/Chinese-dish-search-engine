Zabaglione #1
Sugar, Dry Marsala, Egg yolks, 
In the top of a double boiler, beat eggs and sugar with a wire whisk until  thick. Beat in the wine. Place over boiling water & beat vigorously until  hot, very thick & foamy. Serve immediately. Note: Its nice to serve this  dessert in tall attractive glasses. Thin wafers or cookies go nicely on the  side.    RAFFAELLO    MISSION STREET, CARMEL    IT. BARDOLINO/CA. CABERNET SAUV.
