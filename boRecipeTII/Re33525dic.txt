Neither one of us like eggs, but this barely has any taste at all and warms  the tummy up. And one good thing it doesnt seem to want to come back  up.....stays right where its supposed to.    Mix thoroughly until it looks like an omelet. Put into saucepan, cook  initially at low heat , cover, stir often. When it begins to look like its  curdling, increase heat slightly, leave covered. When it begins to separate  (egg from water) stir one more time, continue to cook until eggs are firm.  Serve eggs in a bowl covered with the watery mixture, salt and pepper to  taste.
