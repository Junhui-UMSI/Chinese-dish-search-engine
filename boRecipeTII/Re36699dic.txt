The legend of this recipe: This recipe was found in an old trunk that came  across the Oregon Trail in the 1800s. The pioneers used any kind of wild  berry, including wild strawberries. This recipe has been cut down to this  small amount from feeding about 120.    Combine to make stiff batter to hold shape.    Mash berries with sugar. Bring to boil in a large pot with a tight lid.    Drop dumplings into hot liquid, reduce heat and simmer, with lid on, for 15  minutes. Dont lift lid - dont peek!    Remove dumplings carefully to dessert dishes and spoon berries over. Serve  with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.    Posted to Recipe Archive - 16 Mar 97 by ted by: ajewell@sound.net on Mar  16, 9
