Whole Wheat Casserole Bread
Warm water (105-115 degrees), Cooking spray, Sugar, Salt, All-purpose flour, divided, Whole wheat flour, Active dry yeast, Frozen egg substitute,, Reduced calorie margarine,, 
Combine yeast and warm water in a 1 cup liquid measuring cup; let stand 5  minutes. Combine yeast mixture, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, and next 5  ingredients in a medium bowl, stirring well. Gradually stir in enough of  the remaining 1/2 cup all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. (Dough will  be sticky.) Let dough rest 15 minutes; shape into a ball.    Place dough in a round 1-quart casserole heavily coated with cooking spray.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 30  minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 375 for 25 minutes or until loaf  sounds hollow when tapped. (Cover with aluminum foil the last 10 minutes of  baking to prevent over browning, if necessary.) Remove from casserole  immediately, and let cool on wire rack.    MC Formatting by taillon@access.mountain.net    Per Serving: Cals - 136 13%ff, Fat - 1.9g, Carb - 26.3g.
