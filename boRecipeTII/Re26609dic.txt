Minced fresh parsley, & boned, Flour, Brown-in-bag, salt and pepper, Onion, Fish, (4 lb) dressed, split, Butter, Seasoned stuffing, Shredded carrots, Paprika, 
Wipe fish with damp cloth; set aside. Shake flour into empty  brown-in-bag. Sprinkle fish inside & out with salt & pepper. Combine  1/4 cup butter, stuffing, onion, parsley & carrots: stuff cavity &  secure opening with toothpicks or bind with soft string. Place  stuffed fish in bag; brush with remaining butter & sprinkle outside  with paprika. Close bag loosely with twist tie about 2" from fish.  (Bag should fit loosely over food.) Puncture six 1" slits in top of  bag with paring knife. (These allow air & water vapors to escape from  bag.) Cook in 350 oven about 1 hour. Remove pan from oven; allow to  sit & cool several minutes. To remove fish, slit open top of bag with  paring knife or scissors. (Steam escapes when bag is split, so use  care not to burn yourself.) Remove fish to serving platter.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
