Authors Notes: This is a beef Wellington recipe that was in the recent  50th anniversary issue of Gourmet Magazine. It impressed me significantly  because I rarely get to see a recipe that has both foie gras and black  truffles and looks doable by me. (Your requester in the digest appears to  be on the West Coast, so Im sure hes got, or can locate, sources for  these delicacies. If he were on the East Coast, I would recommend he  contact DArtagnan, in Jersey City, at 201-792-0748, for the foie gras and  Urbani, in NYC, at 212-941-4710 for the black truffles. By the way,  Daguins daughter, the young lady who knocked their socks off at the state  dinner in Paris for President Bush awhile ago when she served American foie  gras, is associated with DArtagnan).    The dough may be frozen.    Difficulty : time consuming. Precision  : measure ingredients.
