> by: Laurie Souza, Franciscan Oakville Estate, New Orleans Times Picayune.    Boil the onions in salted water until they are crisp-tender, 3-7 mins,  depending on the size, drain.  Remove and discard the papery outer skins.  Do not cut off much of the root end or the onion will fall apart.    Heat a saute pan, large enough to hold all the onions in one layer, over  medium-high heat.  When hot, add the oil.  When oil is rippling, add  onions, shaking pan until all are well-coated with oil.  Add one tabsp plus  one teasp of the vinegar.  Continue to saute, shaking pan occasionally,  until the onions are golden brown, 6-8 mins.    When they are golden, sprinkle in the remaining two teasp balsamic vinegar;  season with the fresh ground pepper to taste.  Shake the pan briefly to  distribute the vinegar.  Taste for seasoning and add a dash more vinegar if  desired, but there should be just a hint of it.
