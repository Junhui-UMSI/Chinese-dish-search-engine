Zucchini Chocolate Chip Cookies
zucchini, Pecans, Egg, Salt, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Chocolate chips, Sugar, Flour, Margarine, 
Blend as for cookies.    Bake at 350, 8-10 minutes    NOTE: The recipe was given to me by my hairdresser who got it from a  client. When I made them, they took closer to 15-18 minutes to bake.    The cookies are very moist and stay chewy.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #231 by "Marsha Lefko" <mlefko@dct.com> on  Aug 14, 1997
