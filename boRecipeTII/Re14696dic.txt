"When the Shepherd Is in a Hurry" Pie
, frozen corn, instant mashed, Onion,  water, flour, Ground beef, 
First, brown your ground beef and onion over medium-high heat.  Add the  onion soup to taste and the water. You can add more and taste it as the mix  tends to be salty. Cook this mixture about 5-10 minutes and add pepper if  you like.    Push the ground beef to one side of the pan and sprinkle the flour in while  stirring the broth briskly.  Careful here!  It will lump quite easily. The  idea is to make a gravy and if you like, you can dissolve the flour in a  little cold water before stirring in. Bring back to a boil and add more  water if you like a thinner gravy.    Pour this meat mixture into a large casserole dish such as a 13x9 oblong  baking pan. Add the frozen vegetables and top with the prepared mashed  potatoes. Bake about 30-40 minutes, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven. Serves  well with a simple salad and about 6 hungry people, possibly with some left  for lunch the next day. Reheats well.
