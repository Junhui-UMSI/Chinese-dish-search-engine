Parboil cabbage and separate the leaves.  Slice off part of the heavy stalk  of each leaf by slicing parallel to the leaf (do not cut into the leaf).    Grate potatoes, small inner leaves of cabbage, and one of the onions. Mix  together.  Add rice, dill, and black pepper. Beat egg whites until frothy  and add to potato mixture.    Set aside two or three of the largest leaves.  Fill each remaining cabbage  leaf with approximately 2 Tbsp of the potato mixture. Fold up bottom of  leaf, then fold in the sides, and roll up. Secure with toothpick if  necessary.    Slice the reserved leaves and line the bottom of crock pot with them. Slice  second onion and layer on top of cabbage. Add tomatoes, apple, and ginger.
