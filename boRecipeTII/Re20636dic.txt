From: "Annette Fishman" <ybigfish@msn.com>    Date: Wed, 17 Jul 96 15:16:41 UT  This is in response to the request for a good fatfree cobbler topping.  It  is actually  a "crisp", not cobbler, recipe (Im not really sure what the  difference is), but I think it foots the bill.  The topping is crisp and  delicious and since this dessert is always a big hit, Im posting the  recipe as well. It comes from Neil Barnards Food for Life. I usually  increase the ingredients by 50% but use the same size pan.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Arrange the apple slices in a 9-inch  square baking dish, then sprinkle with cranberries.  In a bowl, mix the  Grape-Nuts, rolled oats and cinnamon, then stir in the brown rice syrup.  Spread evenly over apples.  Mix the apple juice and cornstarc or arrowroot,  then pour evenly ovser other ingredients.  Bake for 50 minutes or until  apples are tender.    fatfree digest V96 #198    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
