Pineapple Pudding
Butter (not margarine), Sugar, Eggs, Crushed pineapple, Pieces of bread, cubed,, 
Cream room-temp butter and sugar together--this can be done right in the  casserole dish it will be baked in. Beat in eggs, one at at a time. Stir in  the crushed pineapple (make sure you drain it very well). Fold in the cubed  bread--I use white but I guess you can use whatever. Bake at 350 degrees F  for about 45 minutes--the edges will turn golden brown and it will get all  bubbly. Serve warm, as a sidedish with your meal. It could be used as a  dessert, but we usually indulge with our main meal)    You can cut down on the amount of butter if you want--I usually only use  3/4 of a stick.  Leftovers heat up very well, too. Enjoy!    Julie Doepken doepj@ruby.ils.unc.edu
