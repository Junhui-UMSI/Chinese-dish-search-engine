My "Slovak American"  cookbook is missing, by my Balkan one gives:    Knead a smooth dough - using enough cream to be smooth. Refrigerate for 1  hour to become quite cold.    To make filling - boil milk, sugar, vanila sugar, and flower, stiring  constantly, until slightly thickened. Mix with ground nuts and rum    Roll out cold dough very thin and cut into 3-inch squares. Place 1 teaspoon  of the filling on each square and fold like an envelope.    Place on a well-greased and floured pan and bake in 325 oven for 30 to 40  minutes.  Makes 35 - 40 envelopes.    The Czech name would be something like "kolachi".    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
