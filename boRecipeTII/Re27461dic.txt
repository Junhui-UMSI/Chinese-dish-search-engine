Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil,  folding the foil over the edge. Grease the foil lightly. Arrange graham  wafers in a single layer over the foil. Scatter almonds and raisins over  wafers.  In a saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add brown sugar and  bring mixture almost to a boil. Cook, stirring, for three minutes. Take off  heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour hot glaze over almonds and raisins. You  dont have to spread it out completely (it will spread during baking). Bake  for seven minutes. Let cool for about 20 minutes, and cut into bars while  still warm.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
