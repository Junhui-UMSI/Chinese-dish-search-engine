Basic Pizza Dough
White Flour, olive oil, Water, Yeast, milk, Salt, 
Heres a good basic pizza dough recipe from a Julia Child cookbook that  coincidentally is perfect in the DAK breadmaker...    I sometimes throw in a little cornmeal for a nice effect too. I highly  recommend the combination we made last night - a pizza with a thin layer of  ricotta cheese, a good amount of mozzerella, a decent sprinkling of smoked  salmon (it was really a tiny amount, just a few ounces) and some fresh  thyme. Throw it on the pizza stone which has been heating in the oven at  425 (about 10-15 minutes of pre-heating) and then cook for abou;t 10  minutes or until the top has started to brown.    >From: ace@tidbits.halcyon.com (Adam C.
