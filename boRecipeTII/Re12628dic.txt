Salt, Dried fruit-- raisins; dried, Wheat germ, Cinnamon, Rolled oats, Sesame seeds, Corn oil, Shredded coconut, Nuts; pecans, walnuts or, Sunflower seeds, Wheat bran, Honey, 
Combine all ingredients except corn oil, honey and dried fruit. Combine  corn oil and honey and mix well into the remainder. Spread onto two 1/2  sheet pans and bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes, turning after 10  minutes then every five minutes or so, until golden brown. Cool thoroughly,  then add dried fruit. Store in an airtight container.    The recipe makes approximately four quarts of granola mix. We make the mix  fresh every two to three days although it will keep on the shelf in an  airtight container for well over a week. The mix is served in a small clear  glass bowl, crystal if you have it. First spread a layer of granola mix,  then add vanilla yogurt, another layer of mix and top with fresh  strawberries, blueberries or raspberries. The granola is served with cream,  half & half or milk on the side.    Recipe by: Baywood Bed & Breakfast Inn    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by SuzyWert@aol.com on Feb 12, 1998
