White Chocolate Cheesecake
White chocolate, Sugar, Cream cheese, Eggs, 
Soften the cream cheese in the microwave. Melt the chocolate in a double  boiler. Be careful not to get any water at all in the white chocolate as it  changes the consistency. Hersheys white chocolate bars can be used for the  white chocolate. Add sugar and eggs to cream cheese and blend a bit. Blend  in the chocolate. Pour the mixture into a graham cracker crust and bake for  20 minutes at 350 degrees. Let cool slightly in oven with heat off and door  slightly ajar. (Actually, this made two pies for us, so you might want to  have two pie crusts on hand the first time you make it.)
