Absinthe
Angelica root, Anise seeds, Coriander; ground, Wormwood, Cardamom pods, Fennel seed, Vodka, 
I just found this recipe on the web. It comes with a warning that it may be  bad for your health and it is also illegal to make in several countries.    Steep wormwood in vodka for 48 hours. Remove wormwood, add the rest of the  ingredients and steep for one week.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Jennifer Welch <jwelc@DAK.TEC.MN.US> on Dec  18, 1997
