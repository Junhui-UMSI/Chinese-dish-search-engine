Place chicken in plastic bag. Combine remaining ingredients in small bowl  ad pour over chicken in bag, turning to coat. Close bag and marinate in  refrigerator for at least 6 hours, turning 2 or 3 times. Remove chicken  from marinade; reserve marinade. Arrange on rack over foil-lined broiler  pan. Cover chicken with foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Uncover;  brush with marinade. Bake, uncovered, 30-45 minutes or until done, brushing  occasionally with marinade. Four servings.    [Note: When I try this, I think Ill do this on the gas grill and will  probably make double the amount of sauce so that, when I refrigerate the  leftovers for other meals, there will still be plenty of sauce and it wont  be dry.]                                Allison Cozzi
