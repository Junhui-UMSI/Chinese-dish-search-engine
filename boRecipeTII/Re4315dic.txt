This mixture makes a nice crispy coating for chicken, roast lamb, or baked  fish.    Combine all ingredients, tossing well.  Pat onto chicken (whole or pieces),  lamb or fish during last 20 to 30 minutes of cooking time to crisp crumbs.  Do not baste, or crumbs will become soft.    Persillade freezes well.
