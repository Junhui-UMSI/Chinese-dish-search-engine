Make the Pate Sablee tart shell (see below), and line a 9" tart pan with  it.  Or, use your own recipe for pastry. --Peel, core and cube pears, and  sprinkle with some liquor.  In a bowl, put eggs and sugar and mix by hand.  Sift the flour into the mixture and stir.  Next, stir in melted butter. Add  baking powder and salt and stir.  Add the pears to the mix. --Pour  everything into the "uncooked" tart pastry and bake at 300 degrees for  25-30 minutes, or until slightly browned.  Let cool and then garnish with a  sprinkle of powdered sugar on top. ----Note;  As soon as baking powder is  in contact with liquid it starts to work.  Dont make the mix too far ahead  or it wont rise in the oven. Pate Sable: Cream butter. Add powdered sugar.  When just mixed, add the egg. At this stage, the batter will look like  there are clumps of butter in it. Add the flour and mix in for 30 seconds.  Dont over work the dough. Refrigerate until cold and firm. Roll out thin  on a floured board. (You must work fast, or the dough will soften). Handle  the dough as little as possible so the dough will be flaky instead of over  worked and elastic or tough.
