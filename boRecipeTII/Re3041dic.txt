Peanut Candy
Shelled peanuts, Granulated sugar, 
Chop the peanuts fine.  Put the sugar into a skillet and stir constantly  until it is all melted.  Then add the peanuts and pour at once into a  buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces.    The finely chopped peanuts make, of course, a much more uniformly nutty  candy than the usual peanut brittle. The recipe makes about one pound of  candy.  :          --Mry Leize Simons    From: 200 Years of Charleston Cooking 1930 Shared By: Pat Stockett
