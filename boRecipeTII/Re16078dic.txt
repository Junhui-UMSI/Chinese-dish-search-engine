Warm Miniature Doughnuts
Unsalted butter, Cinnamon, Salt, Baking Powder, All-purpose flour, Vegetable oil, Egg, Packed light brown sugar, Whole-milk ricotta, 
Into a bowl sift together flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt and stir  in brown sugar. Melt butter and cool slightly. In a large bowl stir  together butter, ricotta and egg and stir in flour mixture. Knead mixture  in bowl just until a dough forms and all flour is incorporated (do not  overwork dough). Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and with a  lightly floured rolling pin roll out 1/4-inch thick (about an 11-inch  round). With a 2-inch round cutter cut out rounds. With a 3/4-inch cutter  cut a hole in center of each round and transfer rings to a baking sheet  lined with waxed paper. Knead scraps of dough together gently and cut out  more rings in same manner. Doughnuts may be prepared up to this point 1 day  ahead and chilled, covered.    In a 3-quart heavy saucepan heat 1 1/2-inches oil until it registers 350  degrees on a deep-fat thermometer. Working in batches of 4 to 6, fry  doughnuts, turning them frequently with tongs, 45 seconds, or until golden.  (Return oil to 350 degrees between batches.) Transfer doughnuts as fried  with tongs to paper towels to drain and cool 5 minutes. Tosswarm doughnuts  in confectioners sugar to coat.    Yield: About 30 miniature doughnuts    Notes: Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine and Boba Restaurant, Toronto,  Canada    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9072    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Apr 4, 1998
