Cant make up your mind how fancy to get? Here are 2 presentations of this  tasty squash--one homey and one for "dress-up."    PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Bring 1 quart water to a simmer. Cut squash in half  horizontally and clean insides. Place cut-side down in a low-sided baking  dish, fill with simmering water to about 1 inch. Bake 20 minutes. AS A  TRADITIONAL VEGETABLE: Combine butter, spices and maple syrup. Turn squash  over and fill with the butter mixture. Top with bacon slices, crossed.  Return to oven and cook until the tip of a sharp knife easily pierces the  flesh, about 30-40 minutes. Serve in shell. AS TIMBALES: Turn the squash  over after the first 20 minutes in the oven and add 1 tablespoon of butter  to each half. Bake until they can easily be pierced with a sharp knife,  about 30-40 minutes. Carefully scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl,  reserving the shells. Beat in remaining ingredients and eggs. Place mixture  into shells or timbales, and return to oven for 20-25 minutes or until set.
