Mix in graham cracker crumbs and press into bottom of pan (this will  be the first layer).    Spread coconut over the graham cracker layer, and pour the sweetened  condensed milk over the coconut (this is the second layer). Bake in  the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until coconut is lightly browned.    Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the milk chocolate chips with the  peanut butter over low heat (stir frequently to avoid clumps and  burning the chocolate).

Refrigerate in the pan for about 30 minutes, or  until the chocolate firms up. Cut into bars. Enjoy!    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
