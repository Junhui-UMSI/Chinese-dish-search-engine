Trout with Lemon Stuffing and Butter Sauce
Finely chopped parsley, Salt and pepper, Trout, Soft fresh bread crumbs, Butter for sauce, Butter for stuffing; (1 to, Seasoned flour, Lemons, Butter for frying, 
You may use trout boned and gutted from back or you may use trout fillets,  using the stuffing like a sandwich filling between two halves, pressing  them well together. Make the stuffing by mixing bread crumbs, butter,  parsley, salt, pepper and the zest of the lemons. Squeeze the lemons and  moisten stuffing with a little juice, reserving the rest for the sauce.  Divide mixture in four parts and stuff each fish, pressing them shut  gently. Dust them in flour and fry in butter until nicely brown. Keep warm  while you make the sauce. Using the same pan in which you fried the fish,  reduce equal amounts of lemon juice and water to half, scraping the pan  juices. Add a pinch of salt and then, bit by bit, whisk in butter. Dont  overheat or it will turn oily. This is a delicious, light, creamy sauce for  the fish. Serves 4.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Diane Geary." <diane@keyway.net> on Feb 4,  1998
