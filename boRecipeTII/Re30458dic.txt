+------------------------------ FILLING ~--------------------------------  +------------------------------ MERINGUE ~--------------------------------  To make pastry, combine flour, sugar and butter in a food processor.  Process until the consistency of fine meal. Add beaten egg; continue to  process just until dough starts to come together. Gather into a ball, wrap  and refrigerate for one hour or place in freezer for 15 minutes to chill.  Roll out dough on a floured surface or roll out between two sheets of  plastic wrap to an 11-inch circle. Dough is sticky and falls apart easily;  just patch together and fit into a nine-inch flan pan with removable  bottom; trim edges. (If you dont have a flan pan, a pie plate can be  used.) Chill for 30 minutes. Bake pastry at 375 degrees for 12 minutes  until light golden in color. Thinly slice five of the bananas and arrange  on bottom of pastry shell. Mash the remaining banana and combine with warm  cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. Pour over banana layer. Bake  at 350 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes or until filling is set. Let pie cool  slightly. To make meringue, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft  peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/3 cup sugar until meringue is stiff and  glossy. Spread meringue over warm pie; bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 15  minutes or until browned. Let cool; refrigerate until serving time. Serves  6. From The Gazette, 91/02/13.
