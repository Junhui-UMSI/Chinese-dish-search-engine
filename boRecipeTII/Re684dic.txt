Grandpa Larsons Barbecue Sauce
Wine Vinegar, Dry mustard, Salad oil, Coarse Pepper, Soy Sauce - maybe a little, Salt; (Optional), Lemon juice, Parsley, Worcestershire, Garlic, Barbecue Sauce; (Ketchup, Brown Sugar to taste, 
Put all in blender - keeps months in refrigerator.    This recipe has a lot of the same ingredients as the Big Boy BBQ Sauce but  does not have an overpowering ketchup flavor. I believe the Kraft sauce is  used to give a "smoke" flavor to the sauce.    Posted to bbq-digest by Tykee/Peggy <plarson@inlink.com> on Aug 26, 1998,
