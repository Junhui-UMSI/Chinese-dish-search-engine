Also they dont contain pepper anymore. The  pepper was mainly used for conservation. This is my grand-mothers recipe.  The cookies are supposed to be hard and heavy.    Mix the ingredients. Roll it to make a cylinder as thick as a thick finger.  Cut it in 1 inch pieces.  Bake 5-10 minutes at medium heat (Take them out  when they look done).
