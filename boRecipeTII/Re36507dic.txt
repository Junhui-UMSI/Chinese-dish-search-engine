Strawberries and Rhubarb
Red jello; I use sugar free, (16 oz) frozen strawberries, Bag (14 oz - 16 oz) of, 
Put frozen rhubarb and frozen strawberries in a 2 qt saucepan, cover and  simmer on very low heat til soft and mushy. Keep an eye on it and stir  occassionally. When cooked thru, turn off heat, and mix in dry jello. I use  a hand blender right in the pot to puree, altho I used to use a food  processor before I got the hand blender. Thats it. Turns out like slightly  lumpy applesauce.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #249 by MUFFYMOM@aol.com on Sep 14, 1997
