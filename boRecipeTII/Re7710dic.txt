Why, this sounds just like an effort to use up leftover meats! Exactly.  That is the point of the pot-pie concept, and it always has been. In the  old days you would have these meats sort of sitting around, but in our time  we will probably have to start from scratch. If you have a leftover pork  roast go ahead and use it and avoid cooking fresh pork.       Place the pork in a small saucepan just big enough to hold it and add  enough water to come halfway up the side of the roast. Add the bay leaves,  sage, and salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Remove the pork  from the broth, reserving the broth, and allow the meat to cool. Cut it  into 1/2-inch cubes.      Cut the ham into 1/2-inch cubes. Roll the sausage into small balls 1/2  inch in diameter. Brown the sausage balls in a frying pan and set aside. In  the same frying pan saute the yellow onion until lightly browned.      Put 1-1/2 cups of the pork broth into a saucepan and bring to a simmer.  Add the remaining seasonings and thicken with the roux, Mix the gravy with  the meats and fill the pies. Make 1 large pie or 4 smaller individual pies.  Cover with the easy crust and bake at 375? for 45 minutes, or until the  crust is golden brown.      Start your meal with a hearty soup, such as Corn Chowder with Shrimp (see  recipe), and then move on to this unusual American pie.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
