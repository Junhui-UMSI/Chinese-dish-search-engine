Banana Raisin Nut Bread
Water, Salt, Bread flour, Yeast, Egg, Banana, Cinnamon, walnuts, Honey, Vegetable oil, Raisins, 
Add raisins and nuts at the beep.  NOTE:  I coated the raisins with some of  the flour and added them at the beginning and omitted the nuts completely .  This loaf rose to the full height of the bread pan and was a nice slicer.  Source: Donna German Bread Machine Cookbook V.
