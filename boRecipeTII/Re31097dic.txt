Servings: 1    This Banana Shortcake makes a satisfying, whole breakfast - its not a  dessert shortcake.  Because the Banana Bread is made in advance - and  probably frozen ~ the shortcake is quick and easy to put together. I  (Marjorie Hurt Jones) sometimes serve it for "normal eating" house guests  who devour every last crumb!    Directions:    Mash banana with a fork; whip until light and frothy. If you enjoy a little  tang, add the lemon juice or the pinch of the vit C. Toast the bread  lightly either in a toasster oven or in a dry frypan - homemade quickbreads  dont do well in a traditional pop-up toasster.    To assemble: Lay toasted bread on a plate; top with a dollop of masshed  banana.    Note:  If your Banana Bread is frozen be sure to take it out the evening  before you want it for breakfast. Use a serrated bread knife for slicing.    From "The Yeast Connection Cookbook" by William G Crook, MD & Marjorie Hurt  Jones, RN    Courtesy of Theresa Merkling
