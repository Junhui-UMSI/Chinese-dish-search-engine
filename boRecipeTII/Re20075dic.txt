Vanilla Custard Cream
Flour, Sugar, Whipping cream, Whole milk or 2 cups of half, Egg yolks, Vanilla extract, 
Bring the milk and cream to a boil in a heavy saucepan. Remove from heat  and set aside. Put the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla in a bowl and beat  with a wire whisk steadily for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the mixture is  creamy and pale yellow in color and falls back on itself without breaking  into droplets or splashes (like a ribbon or cord would) when the whisk is  lifted above the bowl. Then add the flour and mix well. Add a soup ladleful  of the hot milk/cream (about half of the total amount) to the yolk mixture  and blend well. Then pour the yolk mixture into the remaining milk/ cream  in a slow but steady stream, mixing constantly with the wire whisk as you  pour. Return saucepan to stove and bring custard cream to a boil over  medium heat, continuing to stir constantly with the wire whisk. The sauce  should thicken just as soon as it reaches the boiling point. Reduce the  heat to low and continue to cook for 2 or 3 minutes more, stirring  constantly all the while. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Cover  the bowl with plastic wrap so that a skin wont form as the custard cream  cools.
