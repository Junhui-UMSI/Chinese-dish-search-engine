There are as many versions of vegetable soup in Italy as there there are  cooks. Pancetta - Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon. It is cured  with salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a large salami.  Widely used in Italian cooking, especially in Emilia-Romagna, it is vital  to many dishes. If available, buy a large quantity. Cut into several pieces  and freeze it.  You can substitute domestic bacon for pancetta. It must be  blanched in boiling water for two three minutes to reduce the smoky  flavour.  Fresh side pork can also be used. Ill be posting several recipes  over the next while that call for pancetta, so if you can find some, it  wont go to waste. Prepare chicken broth (see my previously posted recipe).  Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add parsley and garlic. Saute over medium  heat.  Before garlic changes colour, add pancetta. Saute until lightly  browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook 1 to 2 minutes. Add remaining  vegetables to saucepan. Cover and cook about 5 minutes. Add broth and  water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham shank. Cover and reduce heat.  Simmer 40 to 50 minutes. Remove half the vegetables with a slotted spoon.  Place in a blender or food processor and process until smooth. Return to  saucepan. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with Parmesan cheese  sprinkled over top. Makes 8 to 10 servings. VARIATION: Toast about 20 thick  slices of Italian bread.  Place 2 slices in each soup bowl and sprinkle  generously with Parmesan cheese. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve with  additional Parmesan cheese.
