Source:  Electric Bread    This soft yellow bread is reminiscent of your favorite poppy seed muffin,  but versatile enough to take you from breakfast to dessert. Start the day  enjoying it with a touch of sweet butter on a freshly-toasted slice. Savor  with tea in the afternoon.  After dinner, celebrate this winning dessert  bread by topping with slices of cheesy lemon spread. Mmmm!  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #294 by serge.cyr@sympatico.ca (Serge Cyr)  on Nov 12, 1997
