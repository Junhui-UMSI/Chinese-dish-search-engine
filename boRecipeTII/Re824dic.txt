Herb-Roasted Chicken Breasts
Garlic, Dried Rosemary, Dried thyme, Chicken breast, Olive oil, Dry white wine, 
Stuart just asked about chicken breasts and these are in the oven as we  speak. They call for the breasts w/bone and skin but I use the  bones/skinned breasts as they come packaged (in Israel) and its fine. Its  pretty low-fat too. Youll need an oven plus a broiler/grill.      (N.B. I dont particularly like rosemary so tried this batch w/a  combination of garlic-parsley-oregano-basil-thyme; I think you can be  creative re: spices)      Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Arrange chicken in roasting pan. Sprinkle w/salt/pepper.  Combine garlic w/spices in bowl. Rub mixture over breasts. Drizzle olive  oil over chicken. Pour wine into bottom of pan. Bake until just cooked  through, about 30 mins. Turn on broiler; remove chicken from juices;  reserve. Broil until skin browns (or 4 mins if using chicken w/o skin).  Serve warm w/juices poured over. Enjoy and shana tovah!
