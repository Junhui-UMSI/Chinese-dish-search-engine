Chunky Tomato Sauce
Onion; Chopped (About 1 Cup), Cloves Garlic; Minced Or, olive oil, Undrained Canned Tomatoes, Dried Basil Or, Chopped Fresh Basil, Dried Oregano Or, Chopped Fresh Oregano, Chopped fresh parsley, Salt And Black Pepper; To, 
In a heavy, nonreactive pan, saute the onions and garlic in the oil for  about 10 minutes on medium heat, until translucent. Stir often to prevent  sticking. Drain the tomato juice into the sauteing onions. With a knife,  chop the tomatoes right in the can and add them to the onions, or use your  hands to squeeze them directly into the cooking pan. Stir in the basil,  oregano, and parsley. Simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the  sauce has thickened. Add salt and pepper to taste.    NOTES : Because this is such a useful all-purpose sauce, you may want to  double the recipe - but no need to double the oil. The 2 teaspoons will be  enough!  Tightly sealed, it will keep refrigerated for at least a week and  frozen for several months.
