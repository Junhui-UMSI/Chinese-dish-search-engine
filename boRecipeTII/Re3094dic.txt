>From: "Gaye Stanton" <chatter@usit.net>    I use this recipe for potato candy. I only make it at Christmas though.  BTW, I made the Decadent Fudge Cake someone posted and it is wonderful.    Blend potaotes, butter and vanilla in large bowl or food processor until  smooth. Add 10x sugar 1 cup at a time and mix until stiff enough to shape.  Roll out candy between 2 sheets of wax paper into a rectangle. Spread with  peanut butter. Roll up from a long side jelly roll fashion. Cut roll in  half to form 2 9" long rolls. Wrap in plastic wrap. Chill 2-3 hours. Slice  in pieces.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Kerrie Johnston <sweetgums@JUNO.COM> on Dec 20,  1997
