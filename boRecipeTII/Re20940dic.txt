Apple Pancake Deluxe
Vanilla, Eggs, Sugar, Flour, Apples, Butter, 
Saute apples and butter until apples are slightly soft and light golden  brown.  Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, mix eggs, flour, sugar and vanilla.  Pour over sauteed apples and bake in 375~ oven for about 15 minutes until  custard mixture is nearly done. Remove from oven and top with generous  dollops of butter, granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Return to oven for five  minutes to melt butter and set custard.   Serve hot with heated maple syrup.  Freezes and reheats in microwave  beautifully.     This is a delicious brunch offering all year long, but is especially great  in apple season.  Chuck in Pok.
