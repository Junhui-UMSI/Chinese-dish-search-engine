Pecan Catfish
Salt, Ground Pecans, milk, Catfish Fillet; About 1 1/2, Dijon mustard, 
Rinse fish and pat dry. In small bowl, combine mustard and milk. Spoon half  of the mustard mixture over one side of fillets. Top with half of the  ground pecans. Place fillets coating-side down on baking sheet coated with  no-stick cooking spray. Spoon remaining mustard mixture over exposed side  of fillets; top with remaining ground pecans. Bake in a 500 degree oven for  10 to 12 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with fork.    NOTES : Catfish never tasted better!  These sweet and mild fillets have a  tangy, crisp crust.
