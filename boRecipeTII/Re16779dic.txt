It was good, but much more of a stew than a sauce.  Next time I make it,  Ill use real onions, and two cans of tomatoes, and have containers ready  to freeze most of it... my freezer is full these days. In summer, fresh  tomatoes (and probably zucchini) would be good...    Source: Original    Posted by "Aliza R.
