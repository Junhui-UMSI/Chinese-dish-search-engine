The Ultimate Margarita
Splash of orange juice (ca., Tequila, Triple sec, Fresh lime juice; strained, 
Prepare margarita glasses by moistening the edge with a lime sliver, then  dipping in coarse salt.  Combine ingredients in a quart container, shake  vigorously, add a few ice cubes and shake again.  Serve over lots of ice in  the salt-rimmed glasses.  Drop in a sliver of fresh lime. Hints and  comments:    1. there is no substitute for _fresh_ lime juice    2. even if you think the recipe above will be too "limey" or acidic for  you, try it...itll grow on you!    3. theres no need to use a really expensive tequila, but look for one that  has a "NOM" code; dont buy the real cheapies that lack it.    4. Triple Sec can be obtained at several alcohol levels; to reduce the  potency of these margies, use a lower alcohol version.    5. if possible, make 12-24 hours ahead and refrigerate; flavors meld  together.    6. for convenience, I use a "famous-brand" plastic quart container that is  marked in 4 oz increments.  I strain the lime juice directly into a 1-cup  measure, dump that into the container, add the triple sec and tequila to  the appropriate marks, shake like everything, and its ready.    7. if you dont want your margies on ice, use a _lot_ more ice in the  mixture and pour into smaller glasses---these are POTENT, and need dilution  as they are consumed!
