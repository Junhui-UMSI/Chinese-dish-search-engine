Asparagus Rolls
Butter, Sharp Cheddar cheese, White bread, Thin asparagus stalks, Stick butter; melted, Cayenne pepper to taste, 
Place the grated cheese and the 1/2 stick of butter in a small bowl. Cover  and leave out of the refrigerator for 5 to 6 hours or overnight. Steam the  asparagus until tender. Drain and cool. Mash the cheese and butter together  to form a thick, smooth paste. Add a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Trim the  crust from the bread and flatten the slices with a rolling pin. Spread each  slice of bread with a generous teaspoon of the cheese-butter mixture. Place  an asparagus spear on the bottom of each slice and roll tightly. Trim any  of the asparagus stem that protrudes from the end. Place the rolls seam  side down on a baking sheet. Brush each roll with melted butter and  refrigerate until ready to use. Preheat the broiler. Place rolls 3-inches  under the heat. Watch carefully to avoid burning and broil until golden  brown. Turn and brown other side. Serve hot. Rolls may be served whole or  cut in half. Makes 24 rolls.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Diane Geary." <diane@keyway.net> on Feb 4,  1998
