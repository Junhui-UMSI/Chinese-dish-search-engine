In a large double boiler place all the ingredients. Allow ingredients to  cook until completely melted and smooth. When  smooth, put about 1 cup of  the mixture at a time through a blender on high  speed-using pulse-about 1  minute or until each cupful is satiny smooth.  The mixture has a tendency  to curdle as it is cooking, but this can be  smoothed out with use of a  blender. Store in a tight fitting jar and  refrigerate to be used within a  month. Freeze it to be used within 3  months.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 27 Sep 96    Date:    Fri, 27 Sep 1996 08:58:46 -0400    From:    Lilia Prescod <lprescod@ITRC.UWATERLOO.CA>
