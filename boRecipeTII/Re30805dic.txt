Make the tangine: In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add  the onions and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 6 to 8  minutes. Add the bell pepper, garlic, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, salt,  cayenne, and saffron, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the carrots, squash,  tomatoes with their juice, and vegetable stock, breaking up the tomatoes  with the spoon.  Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce the heat to low,  cover, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, until the vegetables are just  tender. Stir in the zuchinni, garbanzo beans, and raisins. Cover and  continue cooking until the squash is tender, about 5 to 10 minutes. Make  the couscous: Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine the water, oil, and  salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the couscous. Immediately  remove from the heat, cover, and let stand until the couscous has absorbed  all the liquid, about 5 minutes. Place the couscous on a warmed serving  platter and make a well in the center. With a slotted spoon, spoon the  vegetables into the well. Pour the tangine cooking juices over the  couscous, sprinkle with the almonds, and serve.
