Sweet Corn and Crab Meat Chowder
Crabmeat, Green Onions, Low-Fat; Low-Salt chicken stock, 1% Low-Fat Milk, Frozen Corn, Salt, Sesame oil, Egg White, Cornstarch, 
In a large stockpot, bring 4 cups chicken stock to boil. Add sesame oil,  crab meat, corn, and milk. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Season  with salt and pepper. Dissolve cornstarch in remaining 2 T of chicken  stock. Whisk cornstarch mixture into soup to thicken slightly. Slowly pour  egg whites into chowder. Egg whites will immediately coagulate into  "ribbons." Stir gently to distribute ribbons throughout soup. Simmer gently  for an additional 30 seconds. Divide among 6 soup plates, and sprinkle with  green onions.
