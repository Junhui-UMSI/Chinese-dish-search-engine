Applesauce Cake in Jars
ELLIE COLLIN CMKD93F, Baking Powder, Ground cloves, Applesauce, Shortening, Large EGGS, Granulated sugar, NUTS; chopped,optional, Baking soda, Salt, Ground cinnamon, Water, ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, sifted, 
Sterilize 8 (12 oz Ball Quilted Crystal - #14400-81400) canning jars, lids  and rings by boiling for 10 minutes. Remove the jars and allow to air-dry  and cool. Leave the  lids and rings in the hot water until ready to use.  Once the jars are cool enough to handle, grease them (use a pastry brush)  with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Bakers Secret); set aside. Cream  together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until  the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the applesauce and water; set aside.  In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,  cinnamon and cloves. Blend dry ingredients into the applesauce mixture.  Fold in the nuts. Pour batter into the jars, filling them about 1/2 full.  Place jars onto a cookie sheet or theyll fall over. Bake in a preheated  325-degree oven for 35-40 minutes or until a pick inserted deep into the  center of each cake  comes out clean. Remove jars from the oven,  one-at-a-time (use HEAVY-DUTY MITTS, the jars ARE HOT!); place a lid, then  a ring on  top and screw down tightly.   Place jars onto your counter top to cool. Youll know when the jars have  sealed, youll hear a "plinking" sound. If you missed the sound, test them  by pressing down on the lids once the jars have cooled--they shouldnt move  at  all.   Store jars in a cool, dry place. They should keep for about a year. Ive  only been able to keep them for a few weeks, they dont last that long  around here. Theyre wonderful for last minute gifts, especially for single  friends.
