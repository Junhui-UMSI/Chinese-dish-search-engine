Thai Ribbons
Round or flank steak, Cloves garlic, finely, Rice wine or sherry, Soy sauce, Dried hot chili pepper, Finely chopped ginger, 
Cut steak across the grain into 1/4 inch slices.  In a shallow casserole,  mix together remaining ingredients. Add meat, cover and refrigerate for at  least 4 hours, overnight if possible. Soak bamboo skewers in water for 30  minutes before threading with meat. This prevents them from burning. Remove  meat and reserve marinade. Thread each slice lengthwise onto a bamboo  skewer, in an interlacing fashion. Broil ribbons or grill on a hot barbecue  for 3-4 minutes per side,basting with reserved marinade. Makes about 30  ribbons or 15 appetizer servings.    __ __ ____|__|__|__|__|___ <--- Skewer  :          |__|  |__|  | Meat    Origin: Beef Ad, Canadian Living, November 1989.
