1.  Place the cumin, paprika, coriander, cayenne, ginger, cinnamon and  mustard in a small saute pan, and heat over medium heat until the first  tiny wisp of smoke appears, about 3-4 minutes. Allow to cool to room  temperature, then grind in a coffee grinder or with mortar and pestle. Set  aside.    2.  Cook the potatoes in boiling water to cover until they are easily  pierced by a fork but still offer some resistance, about 8 minutes. Drain,  allow to cool to room temperature and cut in thirds.    3.  Meanwhile, peel the cucumbers, cut them in half lengthwise, and cut the  halves into half-inch slices. Peel and pit the mangoes and cut the flesh  into bite-sized chunks. Cut the half bell pepper into thin strips.    4.  In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, cucumbers, mangoes and bell  pepper.  Add the orange juice, ginger, lemon juice, mint and 1 tablespoon  of the spice mixture. (Place remaining spice mixture in a tightly covered  container and store in a cool, dark place for use in other dishes.) Toss  well, season to taste with salt and pepper, toss again, and serve.
