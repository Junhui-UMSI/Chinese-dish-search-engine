In a heavy, 12 inch skillet heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over moderate  heat for 1 minute. Saute the zucchini in batches until lightly browned on  both sides, adding remaining oil as needed. With a slotted spatula transfer  zucchini to a platter lined with paper towels. In the same skillet add 2  tablespoons of the butter over moderate heat. Add onion and garlic and  saute, stirring  for 1 minute. Add the lamb, oregano, salt, cinnamon,  mutmeg and pepper. Cook uncovered, stirring occasion- ally, until the lamb  is brown, about 7 minutes. Drain off fat. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a  small heavy saucepan melt the remaining butter over medium-low heat. Whisk  in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually add  the milk and egg, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened--3 to  4 minutes. In a greased, 13 X 9 X 2 inch baking dish arrange half of the  zucchini in an even layer. Top with the lamb mixture and half of the feta  cheese. Cover with the remaining zucchini and feta. Pour the sauce over  all. Bake uncovered until golden and bubbling--50 minutes to 1 hour.
