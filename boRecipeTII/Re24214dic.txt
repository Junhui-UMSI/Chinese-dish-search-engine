Treasure Island Chicken
Salt, Ginger, Whole chicken breasts, Stick of butter, Cinnamon, Orange juice, Plain flour, Sugar, 
Place the 4 chicken breasts skin side up in a greased shallow "stove to  table" baking dish (I use Corning Ware). Brush with melted butter (or  margerine).  Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 30 minutes.    Meanwhile, melt 1/2 stick of butter (or margerine). Combine the flour,  sugar, salt, cinnamon and ginger in a small bowl, mix, and add to butter.  Stirring constantly, add the orange juice. Cook slowly until thick and  smooth.  Pour over chicken and bake 40 minutes longer.
