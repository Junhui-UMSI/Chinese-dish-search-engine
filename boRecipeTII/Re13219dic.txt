Worlds Best Hot Chocolate
See Below, 
In a small saucepan, mix together, 2 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, cut  into little pieces; 1/2 tbl. sweet butter; 1/4 cup whole milk; 1 cup  heavy cream. Heat over medium heat, gently. When it reaches a boil,  stir with a wooden spoon until the chocolate is completely melted.  This may take a while as small specks remain till the very end. When  chocolate is practically dissolved (that is if only tiny specks  remain undissolved), turn down flame and simmer to reduce to very  dense, dark brown hot chocolate.
