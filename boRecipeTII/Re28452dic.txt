Baked Onion Rings
Fine dry bread crumbs, Grated Parmesan cheese, Poultry seasoning, Onions, Egg, Water, 
Slice each onion about 1/4-inch thick and separate into rings. Soak in  cold, salted water about 30 minutes. Drain on paper towels.     Combine bread crumbs, poultry seasoning and Parmesan. In a separate bowl  mix egg and water; beat well. Dip onion rings into bread crumb mixture,  then into egg mixture, then into crumbs again. Salt lightly, if desired.
