Steep crystal malt in brew pot. Remove grains before boil. Add  extracts  and  honey  and bring to a boil.  Add 2 ounces Cascade at  beginning  of  boil. Add ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, orange peel, and Irish moss in  last 10  minutes. Add 1 ounce of Cascade hops two minutes later. Add 1/2 ounce  Cascade in last 5 minutes and the last 1/2 ounce in the last 2 minutes.  This  recipe makes a golden, rather than dark, Christmas beer. With  the  proportions  of hops and spices used, you get a complex mix  of  aromas,  with none of them being too dominant. Other than being a lager and using  various  temperatures, this is a very easy brew to make. If anyone  else  tries it out, Id be curious to hear the results.
