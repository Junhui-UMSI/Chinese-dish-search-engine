Basic Graham Cracker Crust
Graham Snacks- Fat Free, Sugar, Liquid Butter Buds, 
Crush the SnackWells graham crackers by placing pieces on wax paper and  rolling over them with a rolling pin, mix till moistened an press into a  Pam prepared pan.    * I kept adding liquid butter buds until moist  enough to cling together  when  pressed into springform pan (more like 3 tablespoons) * I did not put  any toppings on, but had blueberries,  strawberries  & peaches on the side  for those who wanted a topping.
