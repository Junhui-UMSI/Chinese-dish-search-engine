West African Groundnut Stew
Peanut butter, Carrots, fresh root, Onions, tomatoes, Fresh chillies, Dried ginger, Salt and pepper, tomatoes, Black-eyed beans, Cubed stewing beef, mixed herbs, Long grain rice, 
This is all cooked on top of the stove in a very heavy saucepan with a  tight fitting lid, as the meat needs to cook in its own juices, or a  flameproof casserole. If you have a pressure cooker use it as an ordinary  saucepan, as it seals in the steam beautifully. Also, if you are not sure  of the fitting of your casserole or saucepan lid then use a double sheet of  foil to line it and give it a more secure fit.    Deseed chillies and chop finely. Combine with peanut butter, ginger, herbs,  vegetables and tomatoes and mix well.    Place meat in pan, followed by vegetable mixture and some seasoning. Put on  close fitting lid and cook very slowly on top of the stove for  approximately 1.5 hours or until meat is tender. Dont worry about apparent  lack of liquid because the meat and vegetables will provide enough.    Cook beans for one hour. Cook rice in double its volume of salted water for  15-20 mins.    Season beans with salt and pepper and mix with rice. Serve as an  accompaniment to the stew.
