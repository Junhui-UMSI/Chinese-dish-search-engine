Philadelphia Cinnamon Buns
Raisins, Brown sugar *, Flour, Sugar, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, Butter, Sugar, Salt, Egg, Water, 
Melt 4 Tbsp. butter.  Cool.  Sift 2 Tbsp. sugar with flour, salt and baking  powder.  Add beaten egg and 2 Tbsp. of the melted butter to water, and add  slowly to dry ingredients to make soft dough. Knead lightly. Roll out 1/4"  thick on floured board; brush with remaining melted butter. Mix 1/2 cup  sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle with raisins over dough. Roll as for jelly  roll.  Refrigerate 1 hour. * Cream 2 Tbsp. butter with 2 Tbsp. brown sugar.  Spread this mixture on bottom and sides of a 2 or 10" cast-iron baking pan  (or skillet), and heat just long enough for butter to melt. Cut dough into  1" pieces and place with cut edges up on pan, about 1/2" apart. Lots of  cinnamon-sugar will fall out when you cut the buns. Sprinkle this on top of  the pieces in the pan. * As oven heats to 400 degrees, allow dough to stand  15 minutes. * Bake 25 minutes. Remove from pan at once, turning upside down  to serve.  Buns will expand to form a large cake. There will be about a  dozen buns. Pull apart to eat.
