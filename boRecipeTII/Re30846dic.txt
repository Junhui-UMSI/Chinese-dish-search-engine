Cook over a  low heat and stir until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and strain. Stir  in 1/2 pint water, lemon juice, orange rind and juice. Mix well. Pour into  a freezer container and chill until cold. Freeze for 1 hour or until  mixture has half frozen. Beat egg white to a stiff snow. Add caster sugar.  Continue whisking until white is very stiff and shiny. Pour fruit mixture  into a chilled bowl. Whisk until smooth. Gently fold in beaten egg white.  Return to a clean container. Freeze for 45 minutes and whisk again. Pour  back into container. Freeze for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until firm. Spoon into  small dishes and decorate with orange slices. Serve immediately.
