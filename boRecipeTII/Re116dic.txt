King Ranch Casserole
Boiled chicken, Corn tortillas, Cream of mushroom soup, Onions, Rotel tomatoes  , Cheddar cheese, 
Boil the chicken and save the chicken broth. Debone and cut the chicken up  into bite-sized pieces. Mix together the onion, rotel, and soup. Then you  will layer all this. First, dip the corn tortilla into the chicken broth  until it becomes a little soft. I use six tortillas per layer in a 13x9  casserole dish. Next, on top of the tortillas add a layer of chicken, then  a layer of the soup mixture, then a layer of cheese. Then start over again  with another of layer of tortillas and repeat the other layers. Cover and  bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.    Recipe by from Rat Bert    By Real Food for Real People [realfood@rmci.net] on Dec 09, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
