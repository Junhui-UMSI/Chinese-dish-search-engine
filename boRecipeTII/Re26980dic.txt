Cherimoya; 1 lb (large),

As a raw fruit, it wasnt worth the  novelty price paid for it.    Scrub the fruit clean. Cut cherimoya horizontally in half and place fruit  face down on an oiled pie tin. Bake 400 F until the juices begin to  caramelize and an aroma fills your house (about 1 hour).    Serve face up. The flavor is like a ginger custard. The texture is one of  custard. The seeds are a bit of a bother, distributed throughout the fruit,  so eat carefully. Raw, the fruit resembles an apple-pear.
