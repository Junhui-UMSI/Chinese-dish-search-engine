Broil the red peppers about 5 inches from the heat until charred on all  sides. Let stand in a closed brown bag until cool enough to handle. Then  remove the charred skin. Slit each pepper down the side and remove the  stem, seeds and inner membranes. Keep each pepper intact. In a large  nonstick frying pan sprayed with Pam, cook the onions, garlic and oregano  and 1 tablespoon vinegar until tender, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the green  peppers and cook 5 to 7 minutes. Add the puree. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir in rice, cumin, black pepper and ground red pepper. Divide stuffing  equally into each red pepper, keeping their shape. Set aside and keep warm.  Remove the paper husks from the tomatillos. Droop the tomatillos into  boiling water. Cook for 5 minutes or until they change color to olive drab.  Drain and puree. Set aside. In a 2 quart saucepan, cook the onions and  garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatillo puree and cook over  low heat for 20 minutes. Add the tomatoes, cilantro and vinegar. Spread the  tomatillo sauce in a 7 x 11 inch baking dish. Place the stuffed peppers on  top. Reheat in the oven for microwave for a few minutes. Serves 2. Single  serving = 1 cup grain, 1 cup vegetable.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 10 Sep 96    From:    Joe Ames <ames@PROLOG.NET>    Date:    Wed, 11 Sep 1996 12:34:44 -0400
