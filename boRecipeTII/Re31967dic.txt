While lentils are boiling, remove seeds from ancho peppers and cover with  boiling water. When peppers are soft, place in a blender or small food  processor with a little of the soaking water. Ble nd until pureed. Add  remaining ingredients and blend just until mixed. When lentils are  finished, place in a deep baking dish. Pour the sauce over the lentils and  stir to combine.    Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Roll in flour or corn  tortillas with desired garnishes (steamed red and green bell pepper slices,  onions, jalapeno pepper slices, nonfat cheese, etc.).
