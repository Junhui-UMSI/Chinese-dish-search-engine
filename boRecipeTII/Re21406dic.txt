From: sevans@awinc.com    Date: 23 Nov 1995 07:05:41 -0700  This is one of the recipes I created in order to utilize the carrot pulp  left-over from juicing carrots.  Carrot puree will work in place of pulp,  although you may wish to decrease the liquid ingredients somewhat.  The  recipe is inspired in part by the Tassajara Bread Books recipe for Tibetan  Barley Bread.    1.  Pan roast rye flour in 1 tbsp. sesame oil until darkened.  (This  creates a heavenly aroma!)    2.  Mix flours together with salt.  Add caraway seeds.    3.  Add oil, rubbing flour between hands until oily.    4.  Add carrot pulp, and mix well.    5.  Add boiling water, using spoon to mix until dough begins to form, and  then hands. Keep hands cool by dipping them in a bowl of cool water. Mix  until earlobe consistency.    6.  Knead until smooth; i.e., until dough stretches instead of tearing.    7.  Shape into two small loaves, and place in oiled pans.  Cut tops  lengthwise.    8.  Proof 2-6 hours, in oven set at 100-150 F, or on counter top overnight.  Brush tops of loaves with oil and place damp tea towel over top to prevent  drying.    9.  Bake at 450F for 20 minutes on middle shelf, and then at 400F for 40  minutes on top shelf.  Alternatively, you may bake at 350F for 1 1/2 hours.    10.  Crust will be rough but inside tender, and bottom and sides will be  dark brown. Cooked bread will sound a hollow thump when tapped with finger.    11.  Wait until cool (approx. 1 hour) before slicing, for bread that slices  cleanly.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
