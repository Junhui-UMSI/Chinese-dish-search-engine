Queso Fundido
Black Pepper, Sliced, Monterey jack cheese --, Crumbled, Mushroom caps -- thinly, Butter, Shredded, Feta cheese or queso anejo, Zucchini -- diced, 
Preheat the oven to 375F.    Combine the cheeses. Divide and place in four ovenproof 1/2-cup ramekins or  one 9-inch square ovenproof baking dish. (Do not be concerned if theyre  almost overflowing; the heat will melt the cheese down.) Place on a baking  tray or cookie sheet for easy handling and bake for 5 minutes, until the  cheese begins to soften.    Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Saute  the zucchini and mushrooms with a sprinkling of black pepper until lightly  browned, about 5 minutes.    Sprinkle the zucchini and mushrooms over the cheese and place back in the  oven about 7 minutes longer, until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Use  tongs or pot holders to transfer the dishes to individual serving plates  and serve immediately with soft, warm tortillas.
