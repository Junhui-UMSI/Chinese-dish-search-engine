While going through my kosher chinese, french and italian cookbook looking  for egg roll wrappers, I also checked each ethnic category for something  different to do with fish and tried this one from the italian section of  the Kosher Cookbook Trilogy. My husband says its a keeper!    Smear light a baking dish with the butter and the onion slices youll put  in, in one layer. Then you can pour in the wine (also you can take a little  sip yourself; its good for the appetite). Put in the 4 pieces cod and with  a little olive oil youll brush. Sprinkle on some Parmesan cheese and them  some bread crumbs. Now top it off with the chopped parsley and the whole  thing youll bake uncovered in a 350? oven for about 20 minutes, or until  it flakes nice. Meanwhile, the flur, salt and milk youll mix together and  heat and stir until it gets thick. When the fish is ready, pour liquid from  the baking dish into the flour-milk mixture and youll cook until the whole  thing thickens a little. Pour it over the fish and serve. Serves 4 friends  if you also fill them up with a nice vegetable, and maybe a salad with one  of those cheese dressings.    *Qvelling: Moms pride when she finds out her new daughter-in-law is going  to keep Kosher.
