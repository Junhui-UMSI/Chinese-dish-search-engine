Tangarine and Pink Peppercorn Vinaigrette
Tangarine juice, Clove garlic -- minced, Peanut oil, Pink peppercorns, Fish sauce, Salt and pepper -- to taste, Saffron, Honey, 
Soak the saffron and peppercorns in the tangarine juice and honey for 30  minutes. Place the peanut oil and garlic in a bowl and slowly add the  vinegar in a steady stream while whisking vigoriously to form a smooth  emulsification. Add the juice mixture slowly and continue whisking. Adjust  the flavor if neccesary. Keep chilled in your refrigerator in a glass  container that has a tight fitting lid. Shake well before serving. NOTE:  Fish sauce can be purchased in most supermarkets or if you live near or in  a major city with an Asian population, youll find it cheaper in their  markets.
