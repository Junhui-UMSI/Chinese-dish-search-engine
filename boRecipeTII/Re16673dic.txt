Alan L. Edwards (ale@cisco.com)    Put all ingredients except the scallions and thyme in a blender (or food  processor) and puree.  Then add the remaining ingredients and run the  blender until the ingredients are well mixed, but not pureed.    Makes a little more than 1 cup (enough for about 2 pounds of meat).  Recipe  scales well.  Sauce can be kept refrigerated for a month, or frozen for a  "long time".    NOTE: Pickled Habaneros will do just fine if you cant find fresh; but Ive  found that they are not as hot as fresh ones (like maybe half as hot).  You  could also substitute Habanero-based sauce.  But only use sauce that has a  low amount of other spices (unless its allspice).    One of my latest variations uses about 3 Tbs of Alans Special Mild  Habanero sauce for flavor; and enough Habaneros or Scotch Bonnet sauce to  bring the heat up to the right point.    Jamaican jerk is usually made with Scotch Bonnet chiles, which are closely  related to the Habanero (they are both of the species Capsicum Chinense),  but harder to find (for me anyway). Im not sure of the taste differences.  + To judge the heat, taste when its all mixed together and add more if you  want it hotter.  Its hard to tell how hot the final product will be the  first time you make this, but you will get used to judging the heat  eventually. For me, the right level is achieved when 1/8 tsp of the jerk  sauce is enough to make me want water (but Im used to capsaicin).    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
