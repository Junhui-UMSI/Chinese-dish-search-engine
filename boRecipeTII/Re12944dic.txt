Melt butter on low heat. With a whisk, gradually add the flour until well  blended. Whisk in the milk until sauce is slightly thickened. Add salt, hot  pepper sauce, white pepper, bay leaf and nutmeg. Cover and continue to cook  on low heat for 30 minutes. Whisk the egg, add 2 tb of milk. Add a couple  of tablespoons of the sauce to the egg mix. This is so you don t scramble  the egg when it is added to the sauce. Add the egg mix to the sauce. Add  the mozzarella or cheddar, reserving an ounce on the side. The sauce should  be thick, but a extra tablespoon of milk may be added at any time to keep  it from going gluey. Remove the bay leaf.    Extra filling: Fry sausage meat and banana peppers till the meat is cooked  and broken into small pieces. Drain the fat and set aside.    Boil spinach briefly. Drain, chop, add nutmeg to taste and set aside. Saut  mushrooms in a small amount of butter, on medium heat, until the liquid has  evaporated. Stir into chopped spinach.    Preheat oven to 350 F. Generously butter Lasagna pan. Build the lasagna -  noodles, sauce, sausage, noodles, spinach, sauce, etc. Sprinkle with  remaining cheese and Parmesan. Bake 30 minutes until bubbly on top.    As a variation, leave the cheese out of the sauce and add it as a separate  layer in the lasagna: mozzarella makes a nice stringy layer in the middle.
