Szechuan Peanut Sauce
Chunky peanut butter, Sugar, Hot chili oil, Garlic cloves -- minced, Low sodium soy sauce, Water, Cilantro -- chopped, 
* Cilantro is usually sold in small bunches. You will need only about 1/3  of an average bunch or 2-3 of the stems with leaves attached. It may also  be sold as coriander or Chinese parsley.    Place all ingredients in food processor EXCEPT cilantro. Process only long  enough to thoroughly combine. Add finely chopped cilantro after processing  is done. If added to the mixture first it will take on an unappealing color  although it does not change the taste in any way.    Yield: 1 cup or enough for 14-16 servings. Use about 1 tablespoon of sauce  per serving of chicken or fish.
