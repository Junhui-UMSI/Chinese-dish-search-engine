Another Shabbat Cholent
Handful of white kidney, Onion; peeled and cut in, Couple of cloves of garlic;, Sweet potato; ditto, Handful of barley, Few potatoes; peeled and, Handful of chickpeas, Couple of parsnips; ditto, Couple of carrots; ditto, Few mushrooms; cleaned and, (large) of diced tomatoes, IN A CROCKPOT LAYER, 
Fill up with water to cover veggies. Since I wasnt using a prepared sauce  as I usually do, I threw in every dried green herb I had in the house:  oregano, thyme, rosemary, marjoram - about a tsp of each. Mixed well and  set the crockpot going on low.    This was on Thursday night. On Friday morning I added about a cup of the  dried Beef-Not and mixed well. By the time we came to eat it the Beef-Not  was thoroughly cooked and had lost all vestiges of a soy-like taste, and  the water was well absorbed (a problem sometimes with my cholents).    You can order Beef-Not (and Chicken-Not and heaven knows what else) from  Dixie Diners Club by phoning 1-800-BEEF-NOT. I have no affiliation with  them whatsoever. Watch out - the catalogue has hechshers for many products,  but I found that one of them didnt have the hechsher on the product when I  actually ordererd it 8-(.
