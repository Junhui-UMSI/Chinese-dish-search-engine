Puree of Broccoli Florets W/cream
Black Pepper, Ground, Salt, Nutmeg, Grated, Broccoli, Heavy cream, 
Break or cut the florets from the stalks. Reserve the stalks for another  purpose. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the broccoli,  uncovered, until JUST tender (1 1/2-2 minutes). Drain VERY(!) thoroughly.  Puree in a food processor using on-off pulses and scraping down the sides  of the bowl to obtain an even puree. Put the puree in a heavy saucepan.  Heat until bubbly (1-2 minutes), stirring constantly. Add as much of the  cream as the broccoli will absorb without getting too thin. Season to taste  with nutmeg, salt and pepper. The puree should be bright green and very  fresh tasting. Serve at once.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 08 Apr 97 by Joel Ehrlich <Joel.Ehrlich@SALATA.COM>  on Apr 8, 1997
