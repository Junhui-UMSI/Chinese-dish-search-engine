Maple syrup, Cinnamon, Brown Sugar, Nutmeg, Yogurt, low-fat, Apples, Raisins, 
+----------------------*** MAPLE YOGURT SAUCE ***-------------------------  * A large, firm, tart apple is best. Use Ida Red or Northern Spy. A  Cortland can be used. However, if you use a McIntosh, you must shorten the  cooking time. Core apples and remove top inch of peel. Make a shallow out  through skin around centre of each apple to prevent skin from bursting.  Place apples upright in baking dish or pie plate. In a small bowl, combine  brown sugar, raisins, cinnamon and nutmeg. Spoon into centres of each  apple. Add water to cover bottom of dish. Bake, uncovered in 375 F for 25  to 30 minutes for less firm apples and up to 50 minutes for firm varieties  or until apples are tender when pierced with a toothpick. Combine the  yogurt and maple syrup to make the sauce. Pour over the baked apples. From  The Gazette, 91/03/06.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Apr 10, 98
