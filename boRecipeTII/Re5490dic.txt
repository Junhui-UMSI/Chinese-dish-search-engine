In a small bowl, prepare ambrosia salsa by combining strawberries, coconut,  reseved pineapple pieces and 2 tablespoons sugar, set aside.    Cut bread in 3/4 inch slices.  In a 15 by 10 inch jelly roll pan, arrange  bread in a single layer, set aside.  In a large bowl, beat eggs, milk,  vanilla, salt and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and reserved pineapple  juice, pour over bread, turning slices to coat completely. Cover and  refrigerate overnight or until all liquid is absorbed, about 1-1/2 hours.  In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add bread a few pieces at  a time and cook until browned on both sides, turning bread once, and adding  more butter if necessary. Serve with ambrosia salsa. Serves 6.
