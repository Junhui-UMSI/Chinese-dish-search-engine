Tomato Aspic W/ Crabmeat Salad
Unflavored gelatin, Lemon juice, Tabasco, fresh crabmeat, green bell pepper, Cold water, tomatoes  , Worcestershire Sauce, Homemade Mayonnaise, Red wine vinegar, Salt, onion, Black pepper, 
Sprinkle gelatin over water in a saucer.  Meanwhile, heat crushed tomatoes  in a saucepan.  Stir softened gelatin into the tomatoes off the heat. Add  onion, green pepper, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, vinegar or lemon juice,  pepper, and salt.  Mix thoroughly and pour into a 6-cup ring mold.  Refrigerate for several hours, or until thoroughly set. To serve, loosen  the aspic by placing the mold briefly in a pan of hot water. Then turn it  onto a serving plate, making sure it is centered. Re-refrigerate until it  has set again. Toss the crabmeat with the mayonnaise and a bit of lemon  juice, and heap into the middle of the aspic ring. The crabmeat salad  should not be too seasoned because the aspic is very spicy. Serves 6-8.
