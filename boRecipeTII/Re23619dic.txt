1. Bring a small saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil, and add the  artichoke hearts. Lower the heat and simmer for 3 minutes; then rinse,  drain and pat dry. Set them aside.    Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch skillet (preferable nonstick.)  Add the potato and rosemary, and saute until golden and crisp, about 3  minutes. Add the artichoke hearts and saute until golden, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper and set aside.    3. Preheat the broiler.    4. Lightly beat the eggs with the 1/4 ts. and black pepper to taste. Heat  the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. Pour in the eggs and  cook, over medium-low heat, stirring lightly, just until the bottom is set,  3 to 4 minutes. The top should still be wet. Add the artichokes and  potatoes; sprinkle with the cheeses. Place the skillet under the broiler  and cook until the frittata is golden and sizzling, about 2 minutes.  Sprinkle with parsley, and serve immediately.    From the book "The New Basics cookbook" by Julee Rosso amd Sheila Lukens  Wonderful book, I highly reccomend it.
