1. Cook penne according to package directions until al dente. Drain,  reserving half cup of the cooking water. Set both penne and water  aside.    2. Peel eggplant and cut into 1/3" cubes. In a large, nonstick pan  over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add eggplant and  saute 5 minutes, or until browned and translucent. Transfer eggplant  to a bowl. Set aside.    3. In the same pan over medium heat, add remaining olive oil and saute  onions and mushrooms for 3 minutes, or until onion is transparent and  mushrooms are darkish-brown. Stir in cooked eggplant, tomato sauce,  basil, bay leaf, oregano and wine.    4. Cook 10 minutes longer, reducing heat if mixture begins to boil. If  sauce is too thick, slowly pour in a little reserved water. Remove bay  leaf and discard. Stir in penne and cheese. Cook, stirring, until  cheese is melted. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/tn-94q3.zip
