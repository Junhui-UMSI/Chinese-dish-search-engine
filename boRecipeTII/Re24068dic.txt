Mix the pork with the onions, potatoes, garlic, and seasoning. Simmer in a  heavy pot with one-half cup water over medium-low heat for about one hour.  Stir frequently, adding remaining water if the meat mixture begins to  stick. Heat oven to 375 [degrees] F. Divide the dough in two and roll  one-eighth-inch thick. Line a deep-dish pie plate with one dough circle,  spoon on the meat mixture, and cover with the remaining dough. Bake for  about forty-five minutes, or until dough is golden.
