or Miso sauces), (such as Bordelaise, Raw Seitan, (sea vegetable), Fresh ginger (thin slices), Sauce, Water, Tamari soy sauce, 7-inch strip kombu, 
Prep time: 30 minutes    Place Seitan in an 8-inch square cake pan.  Allow to rest until it takes  the shape of the pan.  Place this pan inside a second, larger pan that is  half-filled with water.  Cover the larger pan.  Bake in a pre-heated oven  at 375 F. for 1 hour.  When Seitan is done, remove from the pan.  Divide  into eight equal pieces.  To 1/2 gallon water, add tamari, kombu, ginger,  and Seitan steaks.  Cover pot, bring to a simmer, and cook for about 45  minutes.  (If you are using a pressure cooker, reduce liquid by one half  and cook for 20 to 25 minutes).  You may leave steaks in the stock for  several hours, if you wish.  Remove steaks from stock and drain.  Brush  with a little sauce, and broil so they will be lightly browned.  Serve  steaks hot with additional sauce.    This recipe has been developed by Bro. Ron Pickarski as part of his work  toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics held in  Frankfurt, Germany.
