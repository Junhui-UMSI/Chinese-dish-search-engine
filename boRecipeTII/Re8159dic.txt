Potato Croquettes (Kartoffel Kloesse)
Egg, Flour, Bread crumbs, Butter, Potato, Nutmeg, Salt, Bread crumbs, Onion, 
Boil the potatoes in their jackets until soft, remove the skins and put  potatoes through a ricer. Spread on a towel for a few minutes to remove  moisture, then put them in a bowl and add the salt. Add the eggs, flour,  2/3 cup bread crumbs and nutmeg. Mix thoroughly. Form mixture into dry  balls (if mixture is too moist, add more bread crumbs). Drop the balls into  boiling salted water. When balls come to the surface, allow them to boil  for 3 minutes. Remove one from liquid and cut open; if center is dry, they  are sufficiently cooked. Remove balls from liquid and pour over them a  dressing made as follows: Brown the butter in a skillet, add the 1/2 cup  bread crumbs and onion and cook for several minutes.
