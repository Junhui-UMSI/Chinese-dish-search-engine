Place 3/4 of the dough  mixture on a floured board.  Form into a rectangle about 3/4 inch (2 cm)  thick.    Add cocoa and cinnamon to remaining dough and spread over rectangle. Fold  both sides of dough into the middle to make a long, flattened log. Place on  ungreased baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes, until lightly browned.    Remove from oven and slice with a very sharp knife into 1/2 inch (1.5 cm)  slices.  Preheat broiler. Place slices on an ungreased baking sheet and  broil for a few moments on each side (be careful; these burn easily). Cool  on a wire rack.  Store in an airtight container.
