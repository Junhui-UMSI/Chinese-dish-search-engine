Salt, Water, Brown sugar, Wheat germ, Bread flour, Barley flour, Applesauce, Oat flour, Gluten, Yeast*, 
Place in pan according to custom. Pg 50 Gread Bread Machine Recipes by  Garrett. WONDERFUL!  I used quick rise yeast. Original recipe calls for 2 T  butter instead of applesauce. Makes 1 1/2 lb. loaf. Panasonic/Natl  machines use 3 1/2 t yeast. DAK/Welbilt machines, add 2 extra T water to 1  1/2 lb. loaf. Total calories 1553 when applesauce is used.
