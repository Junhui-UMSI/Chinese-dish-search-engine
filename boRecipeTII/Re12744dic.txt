Cut eggplant into short strips the size of french fries - the skin can  either be peeled or left on, whichever you prefer. Cut the soaked red  chilies into 2-3 small pieces and discard the seeds. In a wok, heat the oil  and deep fry the eggplant "fries" for about 3-4 minutes or until limp.  Remove and drain. Pour off excess oil, leaving about 1 tbsp in the wok. Add  the garlic, ginger, scallion whites, chilies, stir a few times. Add all  seasonings and bring to a boil. Add eggplant to the wok, blend well, and  braise for 30-40 seconds, then thicken until smooth. Garnish with the  scallion greens and sprinkle with the sesame oil.
