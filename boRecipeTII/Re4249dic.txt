Perfect White Rice
Water, Long-grain white rice, Salt, 
*You may substitute chicken, beef, or vegetable broth. If using  non-low-sodium broth, omit salt.    In a medium-size (1 1/2-quart) heavy saucepan, combine water or broth with  rice and salt. Bring to a boil and continue to boil, stirring often, until  the water just covers the rice and large bubbles start to form on the  surface. Then cover, and cook on low for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat  and let set 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.    Makes about 3 cups.    Recipe by: Seattle Times 3/12/97    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by MsRooby <msrooby@blarg.net> on Feb 24, 1998
