Top Gun Bourbon and Sweet Potato Pie
Sugar, Bourbon, 9 inch pie crust -- unbaked, Eggs, Vanilla, Sweet potatoes -- mashed, Nutmeg, Lemon juice, Margarine, 
Mix together all ingredients thoroughly. Pour into 9-inch unbaked pie crust  and bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. This has a strong bourbon taste.  You might want to use only half the bourbon called for with another liquid  to make up the remaining liquid needed.
