Warm Filet Mignon with Sesame Mayonnaise (Mf)
Soy sauce, Rice vinegar, dijon mustard, Garlic, Brown sugar, Salt, Crushed red pepper, Mayonnaise, sesame oil, Star anise, filet mignon, Watercress, Pepper, fresh chives, 
Place star anise, soy sauce, garlic, sugar and rice vinegar in a small  skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for a minute or until only  1/4 cup remains. Strain out star anise and reserve. If you are using five  spice powder instead of star anise, add it to the liquid now. Let it cool  while you boil the beef. Bring 3 quarts water to a boil. Add beef and boil  for 15 to 18 minutes. (depending if you like it very rare or just rare.)  Remove the beef from water and let stand    at room temperature for 15 minutes while you finish mayonnaise. Mix cooled  reduced star anise liquid with mustard and mayonnaise. Add sesame oil to  taste, 1/2 teaspoon salt and crushed red pepper. Thin mayonnaise with just  a teaspoonful of water to make it spreadable.    When the beef is cool, slice it vertically, with the grain, into 1/2-inch  wide slices. Then slice the long slices, across the grain into 3-inch long  by 1/2-inch wide strips. Spread some mayonnaise on a dinner plate. Center a  clump of watercress in the center of your plate. Surround watercress with a  wreath of beef slices and sprinkle meat with coarse salt, freshly ground  black pepper and chives. Drizzle more mayonnaise on beef edges if you wish  (or for a more professional look, transfer mayonnaise to squirt bottle to  drizzle over beef edges) Yield: 4 servings    Copyright, 1997, TV FOOD NETWORK, G.P., All Rights Reserved    Busted by Gail Shermeyer <4paws@netrax.net> on Jul 12, 97    Recipe by: COOKING MONDAY TO FRIDAY SHOW #MF6611 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest  V1 #675 by 4paws@netrax.net (Shermeyer-Gail) on Jul 16, 1997
