Pickled Mustard Greens (Suen Gai Choy)
Sugar, Cider vinegar, Water, Ginger root, ****  NO   E  *****, Mustard greens, PICKLING MIXTURE, Salt, 
PREPARATION: Bring pickling mixture to a boil. Simmer      for a few  minutes until sugar and salt are dissolved. Set aside to cool completely.  Break side branches off the center stalk of the mustard greens. Tear off  leaves and save them for soup. Using only the branches, cut 1 inch to 1 1/2  inch chunks. Blanch them     in a pot of boiling water for 1 minute. Rinse  under        cold water. Drain and let cool completely. In two 1- quart  glass jars (cleaned and rinsed with hot water) place mustard greens and 2  slices of fresh ginger root and fill with the cooled pickling mixture.  Cover and       refrigerate for one week. Serve chilled as a side dish. DO  AHEAD NOTES: These keep well in refrigerator for several months, except  they will be munched up long before then.
