In a large pot, saut the onion and garlic in the olive oil (put the onion  in first, and add the garlic when the onion starts to look a little  translucent) for about 10 minutes.    Run the garbanzo beans and tomatoes through a blender or food processor  until they are finely chopped, but not smooth.    Add all the ingredients to the pot, and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes  to an hour, stirring occasionally.    This sauce is great over all sorts of pasta.    Adapted by Ron Lunde, from: Shea MacKenzies The Garden of Earthly Delights  Cookbook    20 minutes preparation, 1 hour to simmer. Makes enough for 4-6 people.    My changes were to increase the garlic, substitute a grated carrot for the  honey, add oregano and mushrooms, and use another can of tomatoes rather  than fresh tomatoes, and retain the texture of chopped vegetables by  blending only the tomatoes and garbanzos.
