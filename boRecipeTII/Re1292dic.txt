Diana Kennedys Flan Recipe
Sugar, Whole Milk, Sugar, Vanilla bean, Eggs, Egg yolks, 
1.Dump half a cup of sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and turn on the  heat to medium-high. When the bottom layer of sugar has melted and started  to color, turn the heat up to high and stir continuously with a wooden  spoon until all of the sugar is melted and a bit frothy and is a uniform  medium brown. Pour the syrup into a mold -- I used 9" Pyrex pie pans -- and  swirl around so that the caramel completely covers the bottom and comes  partway up the sides. Set aside and let cool completely.    2.Pour a quart of whole milk into a saucepan, add half a cup of sugar and a  vanilla bean, and turn the heat to medium. Bring the milk to a simmer and  cook gently for around 15 minutes. You should boil the milk down by around  a cup. Set aside and let cool completely.    3.Put four whole eggs and six egg yolks into a large bowl and mix with a  fork. Add the cooled milk and mix thoroughly, then strain through  cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl. (Retrieve the vanilla  bean, rinse with cold water, and dry on paper towels if youd like to reuse  it for something else.) Pour the eggs n milk into the prepared mold.  Place the mold into a larger pan and fill with boiling water to about  halfway up the sides of the mold. Place into a preheated 350F oven and cook  for two hours or until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean.  Take out of the oven and place on a rack and cool. When at room  temperature, wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.    4.To serve, bring the flan back to room temperature. When the caramel has  become completely liquid again, place a large plate over the flan and  invert. Slice into eight slices.    Serves eight normal people.
