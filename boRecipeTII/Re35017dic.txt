In our local newspaper there was a piece about a new cookbook,  *Looneyspoons* by Janet and Greta Podleski. Low fat, but really not low  enough for this group, at least in the recipes they shared, but could be  easily adapted I think. Also there are meat based recipes in the book. The  following is something Im going to try, adjusting for fatfree.    Combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor and process until  smooth. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. Serve with pita. Makes 1      1/2    cups.    Comments from the authors: *This recipe is a creamy, garlicky dip made of  lean beans that is similar to hummus, but lower in fat. and make it once  and everyone will be begging you to make it again, it is a recipe that  really gets around.*    Nutrition Data (as per ORIGINAL recipe) Calories 73 Carbohydrates 14 g  Protein 6 g Sodium 228 mg Cholesterol 0 mg Fat 2 g Calories from fats: 18%    I believe this is acceptable for this list with the adaptions *starred and  it is a bit different from other bean dips Ive seen on this list,  especially the coriander.
