Chili Jar
Spice mix; (up to 2), Jar, Hand-written recipe card, Decorative ribbon or trim, 
I sent this in a while back and it has a good chili powder recipe on it, so  here it is again.    "Seasoned Greetings" -- From the L.A. Times.    The most important ingredients in chili are the spices, and many cooks  jealously guard their special blends. But there is a way you can give away  your chili recipe without giving away the whole thing. Bottle your  seasonings and attach the recipe--without the spice instructions. Tell them  that information is too hot to handle. If you dont have a favorite spice  mix or chili recipe, you can borrow ours.    * Place spice mix in jar and decorate as desired. Use paints, for instance,  to draw chile peppers on the jar.    * Attach recipe card to jar with decorative ribbon.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on Sep 17,  1998,
