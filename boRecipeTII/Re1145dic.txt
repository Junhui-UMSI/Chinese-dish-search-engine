CRANBERRY, ORANGE AND CILANTRO SALSA Here, the classic cranberry sauce  becomes a salsa. The traditional ingredients - cranberries and orange - are  enhanced with decidedly untraditional ones, such as a poblano chili and  cilantro.    Char red bell pepper and fresh poblano chili over gas flame or in broiler  until blackened on all sides. Enclose pepper and chili in paper bag. Let  stand 10 minutes to steam. Peel, seed and chop pepper and chili. Mix sugar  and orange juice in heavy large saucepan over medium heat, stirring until  sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Mix in chopped cranberries. Transfer  mixture to large bowl. Cool to room temperature. Mix roasted pepper and  chili, chopped hazelnuts and grated orange peel into salsa. (Can be  prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Before serving, add and mix  in cilantro. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Bon App?tit November 1997  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Beth Ide" <rev_ide@email.msn.com> on Sep  15, 1998
