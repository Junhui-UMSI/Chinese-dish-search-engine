Put the ingredients one by one in a blender.  Turn on the blender.  Run for  cover (its pretty noisy).  When everything is reduced to powder, combine i  a container.  To use, mix 1 cup of the mix with 2/3 cup HOT water or  combination of water and BBQ sauce, water and wine, or whatever other liqui  you can think of. Let sit 15 minutes, then form into 3 patties. Cook in a  pan coated with nonstick spray. NOTE: If you use BBQ sauce as part of the  liquid, they wi brown much faster - must be the sugar in the sauce. This  recipe makes 4 cu of dry mix.     The variations for this are endless, as you can use different dry mixes.  Good Seasons makes fat free dry salad dressing mixes, and there are lots of  different flavors of soup mix (I think onion soup would be good).  You coul  also use the dry seasoning mixes, like the taco seasoning, etc. Some of the  are fairly high in sodium, but I would think that in a quantity of mix, it  would average out to an acceptable level.
