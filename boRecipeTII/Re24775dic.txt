Aunt Ginnys Banana Bread
Bananas, Sugar, Flour, Salt, Eggs, Vegetable oil, Vanilla, Buttermilk, 
Mix all dry ingredients in a bowl.  Break eggs into bowl.  Add  buttermilk, oil, and vanilla.  Mash bananas and add.  Stir. Bake in tube  pan for 1 hr at 350 degrees.    (Mom found that it also came out well without the oil when a little more  banana is added.)  I also add about 1/2 c. chopped pecans or walnuts most  of the time, just before pouring into pan.
