Perpetual Muffins for the Microwave Oven
Eggs, Baking soda, Buttermilk, Vegetable oil, Flour, Boiling water, 40% Bran Flakes, Sugar, 100% Bran Cereal, Salt, 
This is a great recipe becaue you can make just the number you want with  leftover batter for days to come, My mom has been eating one bran muffin  every day for years, so we always have batter on hand. Muffins come out  moist and soft if timed properly. The batter also keeps a month or more in  the fridge.    (If using powdered buttermilk, use 1/2 C Powder and add to flour, and 2 C  Water, added to the 1 C already called for (total 3 C Water) I have only  used real buttermilk a couple of times, as I wont drink whats leftover  *S*)    Put cereals in large bowl. Boil the water and pour over cereals. Add dry  ingredients and buttermilk (if using real Bmilk) and mix, then when its  cooled down a little, add the beaten egg and oil. Mix by hand - it will be  stiff and a little lumpy. Put into air tight container and store in  refrigerator.    To use: Fill paper muffin cup half full and sprinkle top with cinnamon.    NOTE: If your microwave safe muffin "tin" does not have holes in the bottom  of each cup, use double papers for each muffin or the bottom of your  muffins will be too wet.    TO BAKE: On high setting - 100% power, 1-2 muffins - 1.75 minute 3-4  muffins - 2 minutes 5-6 muffins - 2.5 minutes    Muffins will look slightly underdone when you first remove them - gently  press in the middle with your finger - if its bouncy its done, if its  hard, its overdone- let sit a couple of minutes before eating.
