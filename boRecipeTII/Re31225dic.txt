butter, Baking Powder, Baking soda, bananas, Salt, Granulated sugar, Pecans, Eggs, Buttermilk, All-purpose flour, Vanilla extract, 
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Grease 12 standard size muffin-pan cups or  use paper liners.    2. Beat together butter and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in bananas  until smooth.    3. Mix together flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.    4. Alternately stir flour mixture and buttermilk into egg mixture until dry  ingredients are just moistened.    5. Stir in nuts and vanilla. Do not overmix batter; it should not be  completely smooth.    6. Spoon batter into prepared pan, filling two-thirds full. Bake until  lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer muffin-pan cups to a wire rack  to cool slightly. Turn out onto rack. Serve warm.
