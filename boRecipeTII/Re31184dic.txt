Banana White Bread
1 1/2 Lb Loaf:, Yeast, Instant, Lemon juice, Banana, Bread flour, Water, Sugar, Walnuts, Salt, Vegetable oil, 
Follow manufacturer instructions for ingredient placement. Use regular  white bread cycle. Initially dough may be too wet so add more flour  gradually to achieve a soft pliable dough ball. Add nuts during the last  kneading cycle.    Note: you could add a bit of cinnamon or a tsp of banana extract. I havent  tried brown sugar to replace white sugar, could be possibility.    Make sure bananas are ripe for best flavor.    Let bread cool completely for best slicing.

Its a large bread,       should rise to top of pan, so dont try this in a small capacity       machine or it could overflow.
