Almonnaise
Garlic powder, Soy milk, Almonds, blanched, Seasoned salt, Cider vinegar, Oil, sunflower, Nutritional yeast, Lemon juice, Soy milk, 
Water can be substituted for soy milk.   Process almonds to fine powder in blender or food processor. Add soy milk,  yeast, garlic powder, and salt. Blend well, then add remaining soy milk to  form smooth cream.   With blender running on low, remove insert in top and drizzle in oil in  thin stream until mixture is thick. Keep blender running and add lemon  juice and vinegar. Blend on low for 1 minute longer, to allow mixture to  thicken to desired consistency.   Refrigerate tightly sealed; this will keep 10-14 days in refrigerator.   Yields 1-1/2 to 2 cups Note: Do not be discouraged if, on occasion, your  Almonnaise does not thicken to your expectations. Homemade mayonnaise  products are among the most sensitive to prepare, and sometimes they just  dont respond.  This recipe has been made successfully by many people, but  once in a while it fails even for me [the author of The American Vegetarian  Cookbook].  For every failure, however, Ive had hundreds of successes that  make it worth the small risk.   -from The American Vegetarian Cookbook Posted by J.PRINCE13 [Dale] MM by  Sylvia Steiger, GEnie THE.STEIGERS, CI$ 71511,2253, GT Cookbook echo  moderator at net/node 004/005
