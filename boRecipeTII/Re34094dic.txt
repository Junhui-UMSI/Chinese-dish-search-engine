Bastilla
Powdered sugar, Ground ginger, Almonds, Eggs, Lemon juice, Sugar, Saffron, phyllo dough, Cumin, Cinnamon, butter, Chicken breast, Cinnamon, 
Poach chicken in water to cover with 1 - 2 teaspoons each of cinnamon,  ground ginger and cumin. Add saffron or turmeric, if you dont use saffron.    Meanwhile, toast almonds, chop and mix with sugar and 1 Tablespoon  cinnamon. Set aside.    Remove chicken, shred when cool enough to handle. Reduce broth severely and  add lemon juice.    Beat eggs until frothy and add to broth. Cook until broth evaporates and  eggs look scrambled. The eggs should not be wet. Remove from heat.    Have the chicken, almonds and eggs ready before you pull out the phyllo.  (Follow package directions for thawing and handling phyllo, as it dries out  easily.)    Use a cast iron skillet (10 - 12 inch) or round, heavy casserole to bake  the Bastilla. Using pastry brush, butter pan. Place 6 phyllo sheets in pan  overlapping all around, buttering each as you go. Fold an additional 2  sheets to place in the bottom as support. Spread almond mixture evenly over  bottom of pan. Layer 1/2 the eggs, all the chicken, and the remaining eggs.  Fold 2 sheets of phyllo dough and place over top. Fold in the overhang from  the original 6 sheets. Additional butter may be needed to ensure that the  phyllo sticks together.    Bake at 425 degrees for 20 - 30 minutes, until phyllo is brown and crisp.  Invert onto serving plate, sprinkle top with powdered sugar.    Bastilla is traditionally eaten with the fingers as an appetizer. The  serving size mentioned above is for main dish meal. The filling can be very  hot and it is also traditional to make holes in the top to release steam  and cool the Bastilla.    NOTES : * Pigeon/squab is more authentic, you may try Cornish game hens for  a little more flavor.  Recipe by: Internet    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #777 by LBotsko@aol.com on Sep 9, 1997
