Cut the 4 tablespoons  butter into the flour using a pastry blender or by rubbing it with your  fingers. Add ice water a spoonful at a time, and mix with a fork until  dough hold together. Form dough into ball, wrap in plastic wrap and  refrigerate 30 minutes. Prehaet oven to 425 degrees.    To make filling, melt the 6 tablespoons of butter in a seep skillet over  medium high heat. Stir in apples and sugar. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring  occasionally to keep the fruit from sticking. Increase the heat tohihg and  until the apples are a deep golden brown.  Shake the pan requently to make  sure they do not burn.  Pile the apples into an unbuttered 10-inch glass  pie pan. Roll out the dough into a circle about 11 inches in diameter.  Place on top of the apples tucking the edges down. Do not prick the dough.  Bake in the center of the oven until apples bubble and the pastry is golden  brown, about       40    minutes.    Immediately invert a large plate or platter onto the tart. Holding both  firmly together(use pot holders), flip the plate and the tart, and slowly  remove the baking dish.
