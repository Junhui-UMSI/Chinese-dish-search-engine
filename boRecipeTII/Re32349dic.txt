"Very few people really know the taste of barley. Rolled barley looks like  oatmeal, but has a slightly sharper taste and less nutty flavor. These  sweet barley crackers have a tender texture. Try them with just a cold  glass of milk. 325~F. 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~F.    In a large bowl or in the food processor, stir together the flours, barley,  sugar, and salt.    Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add enough of  the milk to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.    Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or  pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into 2-inch circles or  squares and place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.    Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a wire rack.  Yield: 45-55.    VARIATIONS: For a richer cracker, substitute 2 Tablespoons barley malt  syrup for the sugar and reduce the amount of milk slightly.    This recipe can be made with oatmeal (rolled oats) and oat flour for a  distinctive oat flavor.
