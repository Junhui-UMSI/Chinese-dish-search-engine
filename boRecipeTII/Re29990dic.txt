Baking-Powder Biscuits
Salt, Evaporated skim milk, Rice bran, Baking Powder, All-purpose flour, Apple fiber, 
From the 8 Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook. Tastes best right out of the  oven.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking  powder, rice bran, apple fiber, and salt. Or you could do this in a food  processor.  Add milk all at once and stir until ingredients are just  combined; if you are doing this in a food processor, pulse the machine a  few times just until dough is combined. If the dough seems a little dry,  sprinkle on a tablespoon of water and work it in.    With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 30 seconds.  Then pat and  push it out until it is 1/2 inch thick.  With a 1 1/2 inch biscuit cutter,  cut the dough into about 18 rounds.  Set rounds on an ungreased baking  sheet.  Bake for 16 minutes or until cooked through.    VARIATIONS:  To make herbed bisuits, add 1 tsp dried herbs of your choice  to the dry ingredients, before adding the milk.    To make buttermilk bisbuits, use 1% fat buttermilk instead of the  evaporated milk and substitute 2 tsp baking powder, mixed with 1/2 tsp  baking soda, for the baking powder.    To make oat-bran biscuits, substitute 1 cup oat bran for the rice bran and  apple fiber.
