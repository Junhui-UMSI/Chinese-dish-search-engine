Mix the vegetables together.  In a large skillet or wok heat oil, then toss  in the vegetables and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the eggs and soy sauce  and continue to toss and cook for another minute until eggs begin to  coagulate.    Stuff each of the 4 trout with one-fourth of the vegetable mixture--the  filling will expand the opening by about an inch. Wrap 2 slices of bacon  around each trout, tucking the ends under the trout.    Bake in a large baking dish so trout are not touching in preheated 500  degree oven about 15 minutes, until skin is crisp and the fish is opaque to  the bone.  Test after 12 minutes. Vegetables will remain crisp.
