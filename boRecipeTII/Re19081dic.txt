From: kozi@alaska.net (L. K.)    Date: Wed, 21 Aug 1996 13:51:31 -0800  Lacking lettuce and tomato, and not looking forward to a dry, dull cream  cheese sandwich, I just invented the following delightful substitute:    Microwave vegis and water, covered, on high for 1 minute.  Drain, turn out  onto cutting board and chop fine.  Return to bowl and stir in sour cream  and salsa. Use, thickly spread, on cheese or other sandwich in place of  mayo and lettuce.    Makes enough condiment for 2 sandwiches.  Nutritional content for entire  batch: 125 calories, 6 g. protein, 4 grams fiber, no fat.    *I use Flav-R-Pack Frozen Stir Fry Vegis with sugar snap peas, carrots,  brocolli, chinese pea pods, yellow squash, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots,  and mushrooms.    fatfree digest V96 #231    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
