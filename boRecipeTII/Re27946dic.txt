Three Bean Pilaf
(15-oz) black beans, drained, Frozen corn kernels, Long grain brown rice, (15-oz) garbanzo beans,, (4-oz) chopped green chilies, (15-oz) stewed tomatoes, Water, (15-oz) kidney beans,, Vegetable broth or water, Onion, 
Im always looking for good high protein meals (rice and beans together)  that I can freeze into individual portions. This turned out tasty and froze  pretty well. Its from the New McDougall Cookbook.    Heat the water in a large heavy saucepan. Add the onion and cook for 2-3  minutes, until the onion softens. Add the rice, vegetable broth, canned  beans, and the tomatoes. Stir and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the  heat until the mixture boils gently. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.    Stir in the chilies and corn. Cover and cook for 15 minutes longer. Let  rest for 15 minutes before serving.    I was short on brown rice when I made it, so I threw in a little black  japonica rice to make up the difference. I thought it added a nice color  and texture. Also, the corn I used was very sweet, and I thought that  really added zing to the mixture. If you can find sweet corn, Id recommend  using it.
