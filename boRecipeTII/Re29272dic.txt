Baked Stuffed Fish
White fish, Green pepper, Imitation crabmeat, HELLMANS mayo, onion, Soft bread cubes, Lemon juice, Salt and pepper to taste, 
Mix all these ingredients together and roll up in fish fillets, securing  them with toothpicks. Divide it among four or five good-sized pieces. Bake  at 400 for 30 minutes. During last 10 minutes pour newburg sauce over fish.   Its good with flounder, but any white fish will do. Ive used large cod  and catfish fillets and butterflied them. Just enough so you can roll it up  over the stuffing.
