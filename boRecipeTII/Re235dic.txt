Makes 16 servings. The sauce may be made the day before. Combine in a large  saucepan tomatoes, tomato sauce, 2 teaspoons salt, oregano and onion salt.  Start simmering these ingredients uncovered. Saute until golden: onions and  garlic in 1/2 cup olive oil. Add ground chuck roast, monosodium glutamate  and 2 teaspoons salt and cook until meat loses its red color. Add to the  tomato sauce. Simmer about 2 1/2 hours longer. Prepare noodles according to  package directions, usually in generous quantities of water, for about 25  minutes. Add to the water 2 tablespoons cooking or olive oil. Stir  occasionally. Drain and separate noodles. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Now  lets build the lasagna! Put in the bottom of two 12 x 8 x 2 1/2-inch  baking dishes, a thin layer of sauce, then a crisscross layer of the  lasagna noodles and a layer of cheese. In all use:      3/4    lb. Ricotta cheese,      1/2    lb. grated Parmesan cheese,      1/3    lb. sliced or crumbled, Mozzarella cheese.    Repeat twice with sauce, noodles and cheese. The final cheese layer is  covered once more with sauce and a dusting of Parmesan. Bake for about 40  minutes. Remove and let stand for 10 minutes. The lasagna can then be cut  for serving.
