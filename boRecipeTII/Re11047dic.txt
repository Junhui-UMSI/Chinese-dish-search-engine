Wash the chicken breast, pat dry, and lay on cutting surface. Using a  razor-sharp knife, slice into 3-inch by 1-1/2 inch strips. In a deep bowl,  mix the beaten eggs thoroughly with the marinade. Add the chicken, coat  well and marinate for one hour. Slice the onion, green pepper, celery and  carrot in long strips. Julienne the bamboo shoots. Set aside. Prepare the  sauce by combining the next eight ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.  Roll the strips of marinated chicken in cornstarch to coat evenly. Lay on  waxed paper. Add 3 cups of the oil to a heated wok and heat until almost  smoking. Add the chicken strips, one at a time, so they will crisp well.  Stir with a large spatula until meat is nearly done, about 2 minutes. Add  the vegetables and deep-fry, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes longer.  Remove the wok from heat. Gently empty into a strainer placed over a deep  metal bowl. Allow frying oil to drain. Return wok to high heat and add the  remaining 2 teaspoons oil. When  sizzling hot, carefully add the sauce and  stir until sauce comes to a boil. Dissolve 1 teaspoon cornstarch in 1/2 cup  cold water and add to sauce, continuing to stir until sauce thickens.  Return the drained chicken and vegetables to wok. Stir to coat well with  the sauce. Serve at once. Directions for Marinade: Mix all ingredients  together until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate until ready to use.    GOLDEN PALACE    7TH STREET N.W., WASHINGTON,D.C.    BEVERAGE: TSING TAO BEER    From the <Micro Cookbook Collection of Chinese Recipes>.
