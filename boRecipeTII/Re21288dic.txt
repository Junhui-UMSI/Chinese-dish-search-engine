Un-Fried French Fries
Baking potatoes, Light vegetable oil spray, Egg whites, Cajun spice, 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    Slice each potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch ovals, then slice even oval  lengthwise into matchsticks.    Coat a baking sheet with 3 sprays of the vegtable oil (like PAM).    Combine the egg whites and Cajun spice in a bowl.  Add the matchstick  potatoes and mix to coat.  Pour the coated potatoes onto the prepared  baking sheet and spread them out into a single layers, leaving a little  space between.    Place the baking sheet on the bottom shelf of the oven. Bake for 40 to 45  minutes, until the fries are crispy, turning them every 6 to 8 minutes with  a spatula so that they brown evenly. Serve immediately.
