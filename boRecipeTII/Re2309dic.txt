* Swirl powder comes in a separate envelope with the cake mix. ** Use  semi-sweet chips     Adjust the amounts of fruit, nuts, and chips to suit.    Pat oranges and cherries dry between double layers of paper towels. Add  fruits, nuts, and chips, at the beep or near the very end of the second  kneading.    Variations:  Add more fruit.  Use some juice from the oranges in place of  water portion of liquid.    Serve plain as a snack or dessert, or, add your favorite topping for added  enjoyment.  HINT:  Cut into extra thick slices.    Barrys Notes: I do find, now, that the chocolate syrup adds a bit of  creaminess that the plain recipe lacks. The bread is cut into double thick  slices.  Ive then been cutting each slice in half and either frosting them  or placing a plain slice on a dish with (home made) ice cream.
