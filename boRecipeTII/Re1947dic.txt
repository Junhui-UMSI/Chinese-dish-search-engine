Chocolate Chip Meringues-
Egg whites, Sugar, Vanilla, Salt, Mini chocolate chips, 
Also known as Forgotten Cookies From a mother at school    Preheat oven to 350. Line 2 cookie sheets with foil. Beat whites until  peaks form. Add sugar 1 tsp at a time and beat after each addition. Add  vanilla & salt & beat until stiff & shiny. Fold in chocolate chips gently.  Drop by tsp onto ungreased sheets & place in preheated oven. TURN OFF OVEN  & "forget" for a few hours. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR DURING THIS TIME!    I always make this meringue recipe for Pesach & it`s a big hit every time.
