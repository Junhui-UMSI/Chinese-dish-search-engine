Potato Rolled Savoury Beef
Boneless roast, Onion finely chopped, Small-med potatoes sliced, Salt & pepper & ginger, Sticks of fresh dried, Cloves of garlic (I like the, 
Take the roast and cut it sot that it will look like a big, long, flat  steak. Salt & pepper & ginger & savoury steak. Put a thin layer of  potatoes, then layer the onion and garlic, some more  salt/pepper/ginger/savoury, and then one last thin layer of potatoes. Make  sure that the potatoes are not up to the edges of the roast. Roll the roast  up like a jelly roll. Its easier if you have an extra pair of hands to  hold the sides of it while you are rolling it up. Use cooking twine to tie  up the roast. Make sure that the roast wont fall apart while cooking, so  tie up the roast in both directions. Place the roast in pan, 1/2-1 cup of  water, some more sliced potatoes, quartered onion, chunks of carrots, some  more salt & pepper for the vegetables. Cook in 325F oven for about 1 hour.  Keep in mind that the potatoes take longer than the beef to cook, but if  you have only a thin layer of potatoes in the roll it should be ok. Though  when I made this up, I had a thick layer of potatoes and the center ones  didnt cook very well.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 28 Nov 96    From:    "J.
