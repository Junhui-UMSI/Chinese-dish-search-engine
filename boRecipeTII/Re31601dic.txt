Swiss Broyage
Egg whites, Cream of tartar, Sugar, Salt, Vanilla, Sifted cornstarch, Blanched almonds; finely, 
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla in a large bowl.  Beat (using medium speed if a mixer is used) until egg whites hold soft  peaks. Add 1/2 cup sugar, a tablespoon at a time, beating constantly.  Continue beating until meringue is very stiff and dull. Combine ground  almonds, cornstarch, and remaining sugar. Fold into meringue. This will  make 2 thin 9-inch layers or 24 thin 2-inch cookies.    CHOCOLATE BROYAGE:    Chocolate broyage is used like Swiss broyage. Follow the same recipe,  *except* reduce cornstarch to 1 tablespoon, and add 2 tablespoons sifted  unsweetened, dark cocoa. Combine cocoa with sugar, ground nuts and  cornstarch before folding into meringue.
