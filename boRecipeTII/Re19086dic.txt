Vegetable Corn Chowder
Onion, Finely chopped sweet red, Chopped ripe olives, Milk (I prefer whole milk or, olive oil, Creamed corn, Finely chopped green bell, 
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan. Add the onions and peppers and cook until  the peppers turn bright (green and red) but not mushy. Add the olives, the  canned creamed corn, and the milk. Heat slowly to just below the boiling  point. Taste and add salt and freshly ground black pepper.    This is pretty as well as delicious. A little chopped fresh cilantro served  at the table is a nice touch (if you like cilantro).    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 20 Jan 97 by Bruce Baker <bbaker@COMP.UARK.EDU>  on Jan 20, 1997.
