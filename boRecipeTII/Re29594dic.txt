(8-oz) cream cheese; room, Few grains salt, Butter or Margarine, Vanilla extract, Butter or margarine, Eggs, Coarsely chopped pecans, Light brown sugar; firmly, All-Purpose Flour, 
Work softened butter and cream cheese in a bowl until blended. Stir in  flour. Wrap dough in wax paper and chill thoroughly. Heat oven to 350  degrees. Working with a small portion of dough, shape heaping teaspoonfuls  of the dough into 1-inch balls. Keep rest of dough refrigerated. As balls  are shaped drop them into the cups of ungreased 1-3/4 inch muffin tins.  Press dough to cover evenly the bottom and sides of each muffin cup.  Sprinkle about 1 heaping teaspoonful of nuts over bottom of each cup. Beat  eggs in a bowl; gradually add sugar and melted butter. Blend in salt and  vanilla and beat until light and frothy. Spoon 1 tablespoon egg mixture on  top of nuts in each cup. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 250 degrees  and bake 10 minutes longer. Cool cookies in muffin tins and remove  carefully. Repeat with remaining dough, nuts and filling. Makes about 6  dozen cookies.
