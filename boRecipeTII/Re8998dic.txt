Makes 12 slices    1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 2 tablespoons of the water.  Set  aside until bubbly, about 5 minutes.    2. Mix in the honey, oil, salt and the remaining 1.25 cups water.  Add the  flaxseed meal, whole-wheat flour and 1 cup of the bread flour.  Mix well.    3. Stir in enough of the remaining bread flour to make a soft, kneadable  dough.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for 10  minutes, or until smooth and elastic.    4.  Coat a 9x5-inch loaf pan with no-stick spray.  Shape the dough into a  loaf and place in the pan. Cover; let rise in a warm place until doubled in  bulk--about 1 hour.    5. Bake at 350 for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the loaf is browned on top  and sounds hollow when tapped. Cool. Note: To make flaxseed meal, use a  blender or coffee mill to grind the seeds to the consistency of cornmeal.  As a general rule, 2/3 cup of flaxseed yields 1 cup of meal.
