Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Remove 1 clove of garlic from the head; peel  and cut in in half. Rub the garlic on both sides of bread slices; cut the  bread into 1/2 inch cubes. Place on a baking sheet. Remove the loose,  papery skin from the garlic head and slice 1/2 inch off the top. Wrap in  aluminum foil and place on the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until  croutons are crisp and golden. Remove the croutons and set aside. Continue  roasting the garlic for 20 to 25 minuts longer; it should be quite soft.  Unwrap and let cool for 5 minutes. Separate the garlic cloves and squeeze  ut the pulp into a smal bowl; mash with a fork. Whisk in lemon juice,  vegetable stock, oil, mustard and cayenne.     In a medium sized bowl, combine beans, red peppers, chives or scallion  greens, oregano and the reserved croutons. Pour the garlic dressing over  and toss until well coated. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately  on a bed of chicory.  Serves 2.     per serving: 546 cal; 29 g protein; 11 g fat; 88 g carb; 399 mg sodium; 0  mg chol
