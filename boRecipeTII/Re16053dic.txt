Warm Crab Caesar Salad
Dill, dried, Romaine lettuce, Eggplant, Pure olive oil, Heads of garlic, Crab meat, Salt, cracked black pepper, Lemon juice, Croutons, optional, 
Prepare the eggplant by cutting into strips two inches long and half inch  wide.  Salt these strips and set aside to drain excess liquid while garlic  is roasting.    Cut off the tops of the garlic, so that all the cloves are exposed, and  brush with olive oil.  Season with cracked black pepper and wrap in foil.    Bake for one hour at 400 degrees F.    These first two steps can done ahead of time and just set aside until  needed.    Heat the oil until smoking in a medium size saute pan. Add eggplant and  saute until golden brown.  Add roasted garlic, crab, lemon juice and dill.  Saute together for 30 seconds and season with salt and pepper.    In a large salad bowl, toss together the Romaine lettuce and sauteed  ingredients quickly.    Serve immediately and garnish with croutons if desired. *Note: Use pure  olive oil when cooking to avoid bitter after-taste.
