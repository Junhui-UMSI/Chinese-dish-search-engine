Poached Plums - Martha Stewart Living
Plums, Sugar, Earl Grey tea bags, Lemon, 
1. Bring 6 C of water to a boil in a large nonreactive saucepan. Add tea  bags, remove from heat, cover, and steep for about 10 minutes. Remove tea  bags and bring back to a boil. Add sugar and lemon juice and stir until  sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.    2. Reduce heat to medium low so that liquid is barely simmering. Add plums  and poach until tender, 30 seconds to 1 minute. (If plums are not very  ripe, this will take longer.) Remove plums from liquid and let cool. Reduce  poaching liquid to the consistency of light syrup. For an elegant  presentation, Pull plum skin back from fruit, leaving it attached at the  stem end (this doesnt work on all plum varieties). Serve plums with some  of the poaching liquid.    Martha Stewart Living/August/94  Scanned & fixed by Di Pahl  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #033 by John Merkel <jmerk@doitnow.com> on  Jan 31, 1997.
