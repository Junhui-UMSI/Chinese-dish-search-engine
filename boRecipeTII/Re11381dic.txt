Ranger Cookies
Vanilla, Flour, Margarine, Sugar, Salt, Brown sugar, Uncrushed cornflakes, Chopped dates, Baking soda, Baking Powder, Eggs, Coconut, 
Mix all in order given.  Make sure everything is well combined before  cornflakes are added or theyll become too crushed.    Bake at 375F until BARELY browned.    Yield is approximate.  It depends on the size of the cookies you make. (But  if this is still at 2c margarine, then youre looking at a LOT of cookies -  we make this in a commercial kitchen and get 6 or 8 trays of 35 2" cookies.    From Marie Campbell
