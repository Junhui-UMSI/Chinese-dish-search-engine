Preserved lemons are salted lemons - cut a vertical cross in each lemon and  stuff with sea salt - preserve in lemon juice for a few weeks in an  air-tight jar. If you dont have them use ordinary lemons. The advantage of  the preserved ones is their mildness and tenderness, so you can eat them.  The unpreserved ones tend to be too bitter. If you dont have fish stock  use 3 oz each white wine and water.    Method: Brown the fish in olive oil using the casserole you will use for  the roasting. Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Peel and trim the  carrots and cut lengthways into thin strips. Top and tail the beans and  roughly chop the black olives. In the same pan lightly colour the  vegetables in hot oil. Add the black olives and preserved lemon, cut into  eight segments, and toss in the oil.    Pour over the stock, bring to the boil, lower the heat, lay the fish on top  and cover with the lid, and tinfoil if using. Cook over a moderate heat for  eight minutes, basting the fish twice during the process. Remove the fish  and keep warm. Continue cooking and vegetables with the lid off until  tender. Serve with the fish on top and sprinkling of parsley.    Source: Hugo Arnold, Evening Standard, UK
