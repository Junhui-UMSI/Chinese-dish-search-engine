Strawberry Yoghurt Muffins
Sugar, Self-raising flour, Milk, Fresh strawberries, Strawberry yoghurt, Margarine, Eggs, juice and rind of 1 lemon, 
Preheat oven to 350oF, prepare pans. Blend the margarine & sugar & beat in  the eggs & yoghurt & milk. Fold in the chopped strawberries, lemon juice &  rind & very carefully fold in the flour to avoid squashing the fruit.    Spoon into Muffin cases and bake for about 20 mins, longer if frozen fruit  is used.    Variations: Any fresh berry fruit may be substituted for the strawberries  (raspberries, blackberries, blackcurrants, elderberries or blueberries).    Adapted and TESTED by Anja: Extremely good! One of my favourites. Tried it  with strawberries and blackberries - both work well. Leave out the Lemon if  using tart fruit such as blackberries.
