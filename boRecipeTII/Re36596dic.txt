Make  a  yeast starter by boiling 1 cup dry malt extract in a  quart  of  water  and cool to below 90 degrees F.  Add four of Red Star  Ale  yeast  and agitate. Let set for two hours. Steep crystal malt in 1 gallon of water  for a while, then  "rinse"  in another 1--1/2 gallons. (I preboil.) Add  malt and boiling hops and  boil liquid for 1 hour. Turn down heat to very  low flame  and  add  pureed strawberries, heat for 15-20 minutes. Remove  hops then cool wort.  Dump in primary fermenter and add cold bottled water.  The  temp  should  be around 65-70. Dump in the yeast starter. The next day  or  sooner,  add about 4 tablespoons of pectic enzyme, right into the beer.  Rack after 3- 4 days. Bottle with 3/4 cup corn sugar. Crystal malt adds  sweetness, and helps to bring out the essence of  the fruit. One other  important ingredient was pectic enzyme, as the pasteur- ization sets the  pectin very well. This results in a very nice  looking crystal clear beer  with a pink-amber hue.
