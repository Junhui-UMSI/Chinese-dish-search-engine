It  originally had a cheese sauce and egg topping, but I try and avoid dairy  products as much as possible. The original aslo asked to fry the brinjal  (eggplant or aubergine) slices, but grilling them worked just as well.    Sprinkle the brinjal slices with salt and leave to stand in a colander.  Boil the lentils in the water and simmer for 50 minutes. In the meantime,  "fry" the onions leek and garlic with the celery and peppers, until soft,  stirring frequently. Add the mushrooms and cook for a few more minutes. Add  the tomatoes, sugar, cinnamon and herbs and cook for 15-20 minutes. Thicken  with cornflour if necessary. Add the lentils and simmer for a while. While  the sauce is cooking, rinse and pat the brinjal slices dry and place on a  baking sheet. Grill both sides until nicely browned. Cover an ovenproof  casserole with half the slices and top with the lentil mixture. Cover with  the remaining brinjal slices. Use the soya milk and some cornflour the make  a thick white sauce and season with salt, pepper and dry mustard powder.  Mash cooked potatoes with the white sauce and baking powder (I used a  blender) and season to taste. Spoon over moussaka, sprinkle with paprika  and bake for 30 minutes at 180C or 360F. Grill for a few minutes to brown  the top.    fatfree digest V96 #218    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
