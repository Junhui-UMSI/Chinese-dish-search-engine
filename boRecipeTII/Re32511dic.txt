Sweet Delights
Sugar, Vanilla extract, All-purpose flour, Almonds -- ground, Powdered sugar, Salt, Black walnuts -- ground, Unsalted butter, Hazelnuts, 
1. Have butter at room temperature. You may try solid margarine with almost  the same success as with butter. Place butter in a mixing bowl. Beat with  electric mixer. Gradually add granulated sugar while continuing to beat;  stir in vanilla extract and salt. Add ground nuts and flour; roll into a  ball and chill for 15 minutes. 2. Break off pieces of dough and roll  between palms of your hands to form balls the size of a small walnut. Do  not make these too large. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. 3. Bake in  preheated 300-degree oven for 18-20 minutes. Remove and roll, while still  warm, in powdered sugar.    Yield: About 5 dozen.
