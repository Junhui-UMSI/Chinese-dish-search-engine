Sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent  discoloring; set aside.    Melt butter over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add onions and saute  until lightly brown and caramelized. Remove from pan to a plate; set aside.  Add honey and sugar to pan and stir until it has liquified. Add apples and  continue stirring until apples are almost cooked. Add grapes and raisins.  Continue cooking until sugar has caramelized.    Pour the apple mixture into a 2 quart ceramic souffle dish or other  ovenproof dish. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds.    Cut brie into 1" chunks and spread evenly over the apple mixture. Bake  uncovered at 400 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and  turned lightly golden.
