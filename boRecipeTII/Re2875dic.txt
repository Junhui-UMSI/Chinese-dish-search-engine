Peanut Butter Fudge #03
Jar (12-oz) skippy peanut, Glass cold water, (5.25-oz) evaporated milk, Box (16-oz) powder sugar, Jar (7.25-oz) marshmallow, 
In a tall sauce pan mix the sugar and milk over medium heat. Bring to a  boil, stir constantly and start timing. After 7 minutes (timing is  everything), take a bit of the mixture and drop it into the cold glass of  water. If it forms a ball it is done. If it does not you need to cook it a  little longer. Please dont overcook the mixture otherwise the fudge will  come out dry and crumbly. Take the saucepan off the heat source and mix in  the peanut butter and marshmallow fluff. Then pour the mixture into a  greased pan. Let cool and cut into squares.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
