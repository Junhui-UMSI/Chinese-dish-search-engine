Mucho Macho Pepper Sauce is a separate recipe.    Combine yeast, warm water and sugar in bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. Let bowl  stand in a warm place for 45 minutes, until yeast becomes bubbly and foamy.    Using dough hook/blade of mixer, incorporate oil and salt into yeast  mixture and add flour 1 cup at a time.    Continue mixing until dough becomes smooth and elastic.    Transfer dough to a floured surface and divide dough into 8 equal portions.    Stretch dough by hand into desired shape - round or oval, thin or thick.    Brush dough with 1 to 2 tablespoons Mucho Macho Pepper Sauce, then top with  shredded mozzarella cheese and sliced tomatoes. Sprinkle with salt to  taste.    Place pizza peel (stone) in oven and preheat oven to 450F. When oven is  hot, sprinkle water on pizza peel (stone) (for a crisper crust).    Put pizza(s) on hot stone and bake until crust is lightly browned and  topping is bubbly - about 15 to 20 minutes.    Continue shaping, topping and baking pizzas until all 8 portions of dough  are used.    Serve pizzas hot, garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and  sprinkled with chopped cilantro.
