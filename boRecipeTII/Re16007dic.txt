Warm Asparagus with Tarragon Vinaigrette
Salt, Shallots peeled, finely, Minced fresh tarragon, olive oil, Black Pepper, Dijon-style mustard, Asparagus, White wine vinegar, 
This simple dish has such a compelling taste, youll never have  leftovers. Trim the asparagus, discarding woody ends.  Steam the  spears whole, for about 3 or 4 minutes, until just tender when  pierced with a fork.  Do not overcook.  Rinse in cold water, drain.    Place the olive oil in a small bowl; add the mustard and beat until  the oil thickens.  Add the vinegar, salt pepper, shallots and  tarragon. Arrange the still-warm asparagus on a serving plate and  pour the dressing over it.    Serves 3 or 4.
