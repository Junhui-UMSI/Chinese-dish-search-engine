Stir in eggs & oil.  Mix 1 cup flour, extra  sugar & salt into yeast mixture.  Beat with wooden spoon until smooth. Stir  in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Turn onto a lightly  floured surface & knead until smooth & elastic (about 10 mins).  Place in a  greased bowl, turn dough over in the bowl to grease all over.  Cover with  plastic wrap, stand in a warm place to rise (prove) for 1 hour or until  doubled in size & imprint remains when dough is pressed.  Punch down dough  using fist, knead for 2 mins.  Divide into 12 equal portions.  Shape each  piece into a ball (keep dough covered with plastic wrap while shaping).  Poke finger through centre of each ball. Twirl around finger to form a  ring. Place on floured oven tray & cover. Allow to rise for 15 mins. Bring  water to the boil in a large pan. Add sugar. Place half the bagels into the  water, cook 1 min. Turn, cook for 1 min longer. Using a slotted spoon,  remove bagels to a greased baking tray lined with greased foil. Cook  remaining half of bagels in poaching liquid. Combine egg yolk & water.  Brush over bagels. Sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. Bake in a hot oven  (400F) for 25 mins or until golden. Cool on a wire rack. Makes 12.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
