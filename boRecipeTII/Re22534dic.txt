The combination of oatmeal, wheatgerm and applesauce is deadly!    * Grind oatmeal into a coarse flour before adding to the dough pail.    Add the solid and liquid ingredients and the yeast in order according to  the machines manufacturer.    Be on hand to observe the first mixing cycle and add flour or water as  needed as the moisture content of applesauce varies dramatically from batch  to batch.    Because of the applesauce this bread needs no sugar or butter/oil.    An original recipe by Jim Weller.  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #453 by Jim Weller <jweller@ssimicro.com>  on Dec 14, 1997
