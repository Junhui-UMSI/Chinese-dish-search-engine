Prepare the manicotti according to package directions. Gently drain and  rinse the noodles.    Preheat the oven to 350 F degrees.    In a large mixing bowl, stir together the mashed tofu, garlic, soy milk,  olive oil, lemon juice, sugar, salt, pepper, parsley and spinach, if using.    Line a 9 x 13-inch pan with 2 cups of the spaghetti sauce. Gently spoon the  tofu mixture into each manicotti until they are all full. Place the filled  manicotti noodles in one layer on top of the spaghetti sauce. Pour the  remaining sauce over the stuffed noodles. Cover the pan tightly with  aluminum foil and bake for 30 minute, or until the sauce bubbles.    Source: The Compassionate Cook - by Ingrid Newkirk and PETA Typed for you  by Karen Mintzias
