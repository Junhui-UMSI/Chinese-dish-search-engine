Alicha is a curry-like meal.  In dry pan over medium heat, stir fry onions for 2 mins.  Add the oil  and stir fry 1 minute longer.  Add the meat and brown 5 mins, stirring  frequently.    Add all of the spices and seasonings at one time and stir well.  Add  the water and bring to a boil.  Cover the pan and cook over moderate  heat for about 45 mins, or until the meat is tender.  Should the  curry dry out too quickly, add another 1/2c water.  At the end of the  45 mins, there should be very little sauce.    Serve warm or at room temperature.
