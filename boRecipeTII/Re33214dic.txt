Basic Pastry Shell
Salt, Shortening, All-purpose flour, water, 
Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl; cut in shortening with a pastry  blender until crumbly (mixture should have irregular-size pieces).    Sprinkle cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, evenly over surface, and stir  with a fork until dry ingredients are moistened. (Squeeze dough firmly  between your fingers after adding 3 tablespoons water; if it falls apart,  add remaining tablespoon water.)    Shape dough into a flattened disk; wrap in plastic wrap, and chill 2 hours  or freeze 30 minutes. Let stand at room temperature 5 minutes.    Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and roll to 1/8-inch thickness.    Place in a 9-inch pieplate. Trim off excess pastry along edges; fold edges  under, and crimp. Prick pastry a few times with a fork if baking. (Do not  prick if pastry is going to be filled before baking.)    Freeze Bake at 450? for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a  wire rack. Makes 1 (9-inch) pastry shell.    Notes: This pastry stirs together in 5 minutes, chills in the freezer, and  is ready to roll in 40 minutes.
