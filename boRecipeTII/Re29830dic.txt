Tender Cactus Salad
Chopped pork rind, olive oil, Lemon ; juice of, Oregano, Crushed Feta cheese, Onion, Vinegar, Salt and pepper, (28 ounce) of Nopalitos, Tomatoes; peeled, diced and, Cilantro; chopped, 
I have only had canned nopalitos. MacFrugals (like Big Lots) had them for a  dollar a 1 lb 12 ounce can (794 g to the english-units-impaired) last  spring. The taste is quite reminiscent of okra or green beans, especially  in the following salad from the Embasa can:    Rinse and drain the cactus. Combine the cactus with the onion, tomato,  cilantro, oil, lemon juice, vinegar, oregano, salt, pepper and cheese. Pour  ingredients into a large salad bowl and sprinkle chopped pork rind over it.  Garnish with tomato and cilantro adn serve. Add hot peppers if desired.    This salad makes an excellent taco filling, too.    I cannot vouch for the taco filling, but the salad accompanies a Mexican  style meal very well.    There are some opuntia growing in Ozark glades south of St. Louis, MO, but  they are small. There are awesome (though a bit moth-eaten) ones on the  road to Kula, Maui, Hawaii at about 1900 MSL. They would probably be a bit  tough and would not do in the salad; the can label says it contains "Tender  Cactus Nopalitos!"
