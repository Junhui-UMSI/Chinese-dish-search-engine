Aloha Fruit Punch
Guava juice, Sugar, Water, Lemon juice, Pineapple, Ginger root, 
Add 1/4 cup water to ginger root. Boil 3 minutes. Strain. Add the liquid to  the guava, lemon and pineapple juices. Make a syrup of sugar and remaining  water. Cool. Combine with juices and pineapple. Chill throroughly. [I just  noticed that the instructions call for pineapple juice, yet theres no  pineapple juice in the list of ingredients. If I had to wing it, Id say  try 3 cups].    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
