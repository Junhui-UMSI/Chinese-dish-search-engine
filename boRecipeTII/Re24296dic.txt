Seeing I havent posted in quite a while, I thought that I would post  lowfat from the Taste of Home Lowfat Country Cooking. Out of 455 recipes I  only have 44 formatted. Plan on formatting the rest this week. Hope you all  enjoy these.    Combine cream cheese and spreadable fruit; spread on two slices of bread.  Top with sliced berries, making a complete blanket over the cheese. Top  each with remaining bread. In a bowl, beat egg and milk. Heat a frying pan  or griddle coated with nonstick cooking spray over medium-high heat. Dip  sandwiches in egg mixture and fry until golden brown on both sides. If  desired, serve with syrup or dust with confectioners sugar.    Serving Size: 1/2 recipe    NOTES : This recipe earned "most outstanding" honors in our states  "Berry-Off" cooking contest.  Strawberries make this stuffed French toast  scrumptious.
