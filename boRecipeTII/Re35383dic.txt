Beef Chipotle Chili
Ground beef, chipotle, Vegetable oil, Green bell pepper, mild green chilies, tomatoes, fresh coriander, Bay leaf, Salt, Cornmeal, Water, Onions, Garlic, Chicken broth, kidney beans, Ground cumin, dried oregano, 
If using canned chipotle chilies, in a blender puree them with the water  and reserve the puree. If using dried chipotle chilies, stem and seed them  wearing rubber gloves, in a small bowl let them soak in the boiling hot  water for 20 minutes, and in a blender puree the mixture, reserving the  puree.    In a large heavy kettle cook the onions and 6 of the garlic cloves, minced,  in the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onions are softened, add  cumin, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the beef and  cook the mixture, stirring and breaking up the lumps, until the meat is no  longer pink. Add the reserved chipotle puree, the tomatoes, broth, bay  leaf, oregano, and salt and simmer the mixture, uncovered, adding more  water if necessary to keep the beef barely covered, for 30 minutes. Stir in  the bell pepper, canned green chilies, and cornmeal and simmer the mixture,  stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in the kidney beans, coriander  and remaining 2 garlic cloves, minced, and salt to taste, simmer the chili  for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the beans are heated through, and discard the  bay leaf. The chili may be frozen or made 3 days in advance, cooled,  uncovered, and kept covered and chilled.    Yield: 6 to 8 servings    NOTES : Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9048    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Feb 7, 1998
