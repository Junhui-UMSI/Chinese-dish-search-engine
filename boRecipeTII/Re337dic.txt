From: Jane Patterson <jpatters@willamette.edu>    Date: Sat, 30 Jul 1994 14:56:15 GMT  I got this recipe from my grandmother, and I have no idea where she got it.    Any place it says "Lemon", orange can be substituted if you want to make  orange bars. (Yummy, but orange cake mix is hard to find. Blending lemon  and orange tastes okay, though.)    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix 1 egg, butter and cakemix until crumbly.  Reserve 1 cup of mixture.  Pat remaining mix into a 13x9x2 or 9x9x2 pan,  depending on how thick you want em.  Bake 15 minutes.  Beat 2 egss, sugar,  baking powder, salt, peel and juice until light and foamy.  Pour over hot  crust.  Sprinkle with reserved crumbs.  Bake 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with  confectioners sugar if desired.  Let cool, cut into bars.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
