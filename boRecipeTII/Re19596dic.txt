SAUCES:  IN a blender, combine strawberries, 1/2 cup  honey, and 1 Tbsp arrowroot or cornstarch.  Puree  until smooth. Pour into a saucepan and heat, whisking,  until slightly thickened. Pour into a bowl to let  cool. Press kiwifruit through a strainer to remove  seeds. In a blender, combine strained kiwifruit with  remaining 1 Tbsp arrowroot or cornstarch and 1/2 cup  honey. PUree until smooth. Pour sauce into a clean  saucepan and heat, whisking, until slightly thickened.  Pour into a bowl to let cool.    TO SERVE:  Ladle a small amount of red sauce on half  of a dessert plate, and an equal amount of green sauce  on the other half. Place a slice of cake in the center  and drizzle with stripes of the two sauces and chunks  of kiwifruit if desired.  Serve immediately. SERVES 12.    HELPFUL HINT:  The trick to a successful angel-food  cake is the lightness of the beaten egg whites, so  fold them quickly into the batter before they have a  chance to separate.
