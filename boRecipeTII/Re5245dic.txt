*DIRECTIONS*    Combine first 6 ingredients in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in milk.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened and  smooth. Remove from heat; add cheese and pimiento, stirring until cheese  melts. Cool mixture to lukewarm (105 to 115 degrees).    Dissolve yeast in warm water; add to cooled cheese mixture.

Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from  drafts, 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.    Punch dough down, and shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9x5x3-inch  loafpan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 1 hour or  until doubled in bulk.    Brush top with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40  minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Remove loaf from pan, and  cool on a wire rack.    Yields 1 loaf.
