Peanut Butter Satin
Eggs (3 or 4), Honey or brown sugar, Peanut butter, Butter, Vanilla, 
Servings:  2    Cream butters, sweetener and vanilla together.    Add  eggs,  one  at a time, beating on high speed  at least 5 minutes after  each addition.  If mixture doesnt whip up well, be sure you are beating  the full 5 minutes, or chill well, then finish beating.    Serve  1/4 c in an attractive glass, or use as a pie or torte layer  filling.    May be sprinkled with carob chips.    I  actually  mixed in carob powder to taste and it turned out even better.
