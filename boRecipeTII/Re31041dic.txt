Banana Pancakes #2
Salt, Mashed banana (see note), Vegetable oil, Sugar, Egg, Flour, Baking Powder, milk, 
Alex requested a Banana Pancakes recipe. We have these all the time. Any  basic pancake recipe will do with "some mashed banana" added. I ususally  use Bisquick because we like it. For 2 cups of Bisquick I use 1 small  banana. But here is a basic (scratch) recipe:     Combine flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Set aside. Combine egg, milk  and oil. Add to dry ingredients. Add mashed banana.     NOTE: The quantitly of banana can vary greatly. (A fork works nicely but I  use a manual baby food grinder for more even consistency.) When using very  ripe bananas, less banana can be used. Experiment with quantity to see what  you like !
