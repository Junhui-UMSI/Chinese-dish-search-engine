Woof Walliess Ice Cream Pancakes
Baking Powder, Water, Sugar, Flour, Vegetable oil, Salt, Melted vanilla ice cream, Eggs, 
Combine dry ingedients in bowl. Combine liquids and mix with dry  ingredients. Cook over medium heat until pancakes are bubbly on top and  sides look dry. Flip and continue cooking until done, about 2 mins.    Cairns notes: Ive found this batter to be a bit runny so I usually omit  the water unless Ive doubled the recipe. For a scrumptious variation, add  diced apples sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon to the batter. It tastes like  creamy apple pie and the smell is wonderful.
