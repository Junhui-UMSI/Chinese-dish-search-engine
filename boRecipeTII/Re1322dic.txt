Chop up the bacon or the pork and simmer slowly, until fat is  released....chop up bacon, add onions, garlic, peppers, and simmer in the  fat, add the bacon back into the pot, along with the fish stock, cook this  for about five minutes, and add the vegetables. Cook this until the  vegetables are tender and add the tomato soup, undiluted, cook some more,  and add the tomatoes, and about five minutes before serving add the can of  clams.    I also added about 3/4 lb of fresh cod, chopped up along with the  clams....season to taste, and add the herbs...let sit for about five  minutes, make soda bread, or tea biscuits, or just fresh home made bread or  whatever...sea biscuits are fine(if you soak em) Do the tea biscuits, or  soda bread while the chowder is cooking! Great stuff.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Dec  05, 1998,
