pork baby back ribs- 1 lb per person, marinate in cider vinegar 10-30  minutes; liberally sprinkle with garlic salt; liberally sprinkle with  canned black pepper; cook on grill- 2 1/2 hrs med heat on a water smoker  with mesquite chunks; serve sauce on the side if necessary    Thats it? Thats it!! These are the worlds best ribs. Dont change a  thing. Dont add anything.  I have methodically tried every way to prepare  ribs and nothing else comes close. Dont try fresh garlic or grinding your  own pepper. Dont try fatty country style ribs. This weekend I tried to  substitute a small rack of spare ribs. My wife (and biggest BBQ fan) almost  started crying. "What did you do to the ribs?  You just cant leave  anything alone, can you Mr. Tool Time?"    Although I make a good chipotle BBQ sauce (I had to mention chiles in here  somewhere), I dont use it on the ribs. The vinegar sweetens the meat. The  mesquite smoke is spicy. Using a water smoker keeps them juicy.    Several people requested the sauce recipe that goes with the baby back  ribs. This goes on the side after you serve the ribs. That way you can let  it mix with the borracho beans and corn bread.    Smoked BBQ Sauce: Simmer 1/2 hour to thicken.
