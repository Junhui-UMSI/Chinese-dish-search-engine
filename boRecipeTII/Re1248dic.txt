Curly Kale and Chick Pea Balti
Cumin seeds, Onion, Garlic, tomatoes  , Dried ground coriander, Dried ground turmeric, Powdered vegan stock powder, chick peas  , Curly kale, black pepper, 
Today I found this recipe at Vegan Times. I omitted the oil. I cannot try  it, as in Suriname kale is not sold. Perhaps you can make it with black eye  peas instead of chick peas?    Peel and chop the onion. Crush the garlic. Remove any overly thick stems  from the kale and then chop the leaves. Drain and rinse the chick peas    Place a wok or large pan over a medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and once  they begin to sizzle, spoon in some water and peas liquid. Add the onion.  Stir fry for a couple of minutes.    Add the garlic and cook for a further minute, being careful that it doesnt  burn. Add the tomatoes &emdash; chop them in the pan with a large spoon.  Then add all the remaining ingredients except the ground black pepper    Bring to a boil and cook for 5-10 minutes until the kale has softened to  your liking    Season with plenty of freshly ground black pepper and check for saltiness,  adding any more stock powder needed. Serve immediately with rice or  chapatis    Posted to fatfree digest by "Boxel" <boxel@sr.net> on Nov 1, 1998,
