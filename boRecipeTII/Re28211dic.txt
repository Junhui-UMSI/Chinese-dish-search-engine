Coat fish lightly with mayo or olive oil and lay in a shallow baking dish.  Put in a 350F oven to bake. While fish is cooking, saute onion until  translucent, add garlic, tomatoes, and olives and cook just until tomatoes  collapse. Just before fish is done, top with crumbled feta and cook just  until cheese softens/melts. Top with veggies and serve.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.
