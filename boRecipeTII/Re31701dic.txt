Swiss-Style Skewered Liver and Bacon
Bacon -- cut in half, Parsley, Sage -- ground, White pepper, Beef liver -- sliced, 
1. In a large saute pan partially cook bacon until it is limp and beginning  to brown; drain on paper towels.    2. Cut liver into strips 1 inch wide and about 2 inches long. Sprinkle  lightly with pepper, then with sage. Wrap a partially cooked bacon strip  around each liver strip. Thread on 8-inch bamboo skewers, about 3 to a  skewer, to hold bacon in place.    3. Preheat broiler. Arrange skewers on rack in broiler pan. Broil, 3 to 4  inches from heat, until bacon is well browned on both sides, turning once  (liver should be slightly pink in the center). Serve sprinkled with  parsley.
