Tomato Summer Pudding
Virgin olive oil, fresh basil, Lemon juice, Sugar, Salt, Fresh plum tomatoes, Good stale italian bread, Tomato passata, Black pepper, Garlic, Worchestershire, 
Have enough tomatoes to overfill the pudding basin you will use. Dip into  boiling water and peel them. Chop roughly and sprinkle with good sea salt  and pepper and a tiny bit of sugar. Pour some passata into a large soup  plate and season with lemon juice and Worstershire sauce, and maybe a touch  of Tabasco pepper sauce. Soak the bread slices briefly in this mixture and  line your bowl with them, leavin no cracks or crannies.    To the tomatoes add as much crushed garlic as you fancy, a good measure of  olive oil and lots of torn up basil leaves. Adjust the seasoning and pour  the whole lot into the bread lined bowl. Seal the top with more soaked  bread. Place the receptacle on top with weights and leave overnight in the  refrigerator. Turn out onto a fine dish and surround with goodies--quail  eggs, olives, peppers, capers or what you will. A bowl of sour cream might  be passed round with it, or good home-made mayonnaise.    formatted by suechef@sover.net    Recipe by: Two Fat Ladies #FL1A03    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #797 by Sue <suechef@sover.net> on Sep 22,  1997
