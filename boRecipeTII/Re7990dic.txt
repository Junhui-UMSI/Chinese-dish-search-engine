Its  particularly adaptable-- working well with fresh or frozen vegetables (or  dried onion).  I have also  made it in a low fat version--not as good but  still acceptable.    Optional:  presoak the peas an hour or more to reduce cooking time.  There  is no need to drain the soaking liquid because split peas are easy to  digest.    Simmer peas (30 minutes if presoaked, 45-60 if not) until tender.    Optional--if using fresh carrot and onion:  "sweat" (lightly saute) the  carrot and onion in additional butter before adding  to the peas.    Add fresh carrot, fresh or dried onion, and fresh peas 20-25 minutes before  completion.  Add frozen carrot, onion, and peas 10 minutes before  completion. Add sugar.    Puree mixture in blender in small batches to avoid overflowing.  Use the  heavy cream to assist the process.    Serving Ideas : 1 serving = 1 cup    NOTES : I also add leeks and/or shallots when available.  This soup is  acceptable when made with milk--even skim milk--but much much better with  cream.
