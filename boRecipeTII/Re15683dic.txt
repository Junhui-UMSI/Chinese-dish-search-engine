1. Place the rinsed beans in a bowl, add 2 to 3 cups of water and soak  overnight. Check the beans occasionally and add water as necessary to keep  them moist.~ 2. Pour the beans and the water in which they were soaked into  a heavy saucepan and add 2 to 3 more cups of water. Bring to a boil over  medium-high heat, then lower heat and simmer, partially covered, for about  45 minutes, until the beans are cooked but still firm. Check occasionally  and add water if necessary. Drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid.~  3. Melt the lard in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the beans and  lightly fry them in the lard. Set aside.~ 4. Melt the drippings in a large  heavy pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it is  translucent.~ 5. Combine the sausage and the beef with all the spices up  through the oregano. Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with the  onion. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring occasionally,  until the meat is very well browned.~ 6. Add the reserved bean-cooking  liquid to the pot. Stir in all the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil,  then lower the heat and cook, uncovered, for 1/2 hour longer. Stir  occasionally. Add water only if necessary to maintain the consistency of a  chunky soup.~ 7. Taste when curiosity becomes unbearable and courage is  strong. Adjust seasonings.~    Yield:  4 servings  Posted to recipelu-digest by P&S Gruenwald <sitm@ne.infi.net> on Feb 15,  1998
