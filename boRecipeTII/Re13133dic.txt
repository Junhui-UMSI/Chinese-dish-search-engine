March chop the ground meat a few times to loosen formation. (with the  ground meat on the chopping board, take a knife and chop-chop a bit.) Place  in bowl and add seasonings. Mix until smooth. Divide roughly into 36  portions and wrap in wonton wrappers.    Bring 5-6 cups of water to a boil in a large pot; turn heat to medium high,  drop in wontons, and stir gently. When water boils again, add 1 1/2 cups  cold water. When it boils again, add another 1 1/2 cups cold water. When  this comes to a boil the third tim, let it boil for about 2 minutes. The  wontons are cooked when they float to the top. Repeatedly adding the cold  water serves two purposes; it gives the wontons enough time to cook as well  as rinising them.    After boiling, the wontons may be covered and stored 2-3 days in the  refrigerator. Submerge in cold water to separate before adding to soup.    When ready to eat, bring stock to a simmer and drop the wontons into it.  Add the torn spinach and when the stock comes to a boil, lower and simmer  for about 2 minutes.    Filling may be varied by decreasing meat and adding a proportionate amount  of diced fresh shrimp. You can also use crabmeat. Any leafy green vegetable  can be used in place of the spinach as well as sliced presoaked Chinese  mushrooms and shredded meat such as chicken, pork or ham.
