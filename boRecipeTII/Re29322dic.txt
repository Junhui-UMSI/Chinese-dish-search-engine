Since there are a number of ginger lovers on this list, thought  Id share!  From Preventions Quick and Healthy Low-Fat Cooking  (Mediterranean).    Combine all ingredients. Bake in 8x8" baking dish at 400F for 20 minutes.    The original recipe called for 1 tablespoon olive oil and a  non-stick-sprayed baking dish, neither of which we used. No sticking, no  problems.
