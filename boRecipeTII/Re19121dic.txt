Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place large platter covered with towel in  oven.    Heat oil to 370 F in a 6-inch tall frying pan with basket. Make batter by  stirring together flour, semolina, baking powder and salt. Slowly add cold  water, stirring until smooth batter is formed. Add oil and stir through.  To cook, dip vegetables in order of ingredients in as little batter as  possible and fry until each is golden brown and crisp. Drain after frying  on paper towels. When drained, arrange on platter.
