> From: srasheed@juno.com (Sam M Rasheed)    Split the avocado in half, remove the stone and skin, and cut the flesh  into neat slices. Brush with lemon juice. Slice the tomatoes and arrange  alternately with the avocado around the outer edge of a flat serving dish.  Mix the chicken with spring onions, parsley and nuts. Whisk together the  garlic vinaigrette ingredients and use enough to coat the chicken well.  Pile the mixture in the center of the avocado and tomato. Brush the avocado  and tomato with a little dressing and sprinkle everything lightly with  chopped parsley. Serves 4-6.
