All-Bran Fruit Loaf
All-Bran, Flour, Sugar, Dried mixed fruit, milk, 
From: Sharon.Curtis@comlab.oxford.ac.uk (Sharon Curtis)    Date: Tue, 6 Dec 1994 12:34:06 GMT  Soak first four ingredients together for at least 1 hour.  Mix the flour in  well, and put into a greased lined loaf tin and bake for approximately 1  hour at 375F.    Notes: The cake is delicious, and served in slices with a little margarine  on. If you wrap it in foil and keep for a few days (if it lasts that long)  the flavour gets even better. The all-bran is available in the UK as  Kelloggs AllBran. Its sort of little sticks of high-fibre bran stuff. If  you cant get it in the US, I dont know what the equivalent is (not having  been to the US myself).
