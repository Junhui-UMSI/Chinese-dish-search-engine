Soak bean threads in cold water to cover 20 to 30  minutes. Cook in 2 quarts boiling water until al dente, about 1 minute.  Transfer to colander and rinse with cold water, drain well. Blanch carrots  in boiling noodle water 1 minute. Rinse in cold water. Blanch, drain and  rinse snow peas and bean sprouts the same way (blanch bean sprouts for 30  seconds). Fill a large shallow bowl with cold water. Soak a sheet of rice  paper for 1 minute. Carefully (very carefully!) transfer to a dry paper  towel, and let sit 1 to 2 minutes until pliable. To assemble rolls, arrange  2 mint leaves in a row along the bottom third of the rice paper. Arrange  1/12 of noodles, mushrooms, carrots, scallions, cucumber and snow peas in a  row on top. Roll up rice paper, folding in flaps after first turn. Add one  basil leaf after first turn. This forms a compact roll about 6 inches long.  Once assembled, they will keep for 6 hours, covered in refrigerator. To  serve, cut in half on the diagonal. Makes 12 rolls.    Digest eat-lf.v096.n085    From the EAT-LF recipe list.
