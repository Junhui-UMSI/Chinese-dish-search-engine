Preheat oven to 350. Place lamb in a large (6-quart or more) ovenproof  casserole or Dutch oven and add onion, bell pepper, potatoes, tomatoes,  green onion, garlic, dill, paprika, salt, and black pepper.Pour on olive  oil and then the water. Cover and bake 2 1/2 hours.Scatter squash and green  beans on top of other ingredients and add a little more water (about half a  cup) if the stew looks dry. Bake 30 minutes longer. Remove casserole from  oven, leaving oven turned on if serving stew the same night. Pour off (or  tilt casserole and spoon off) most of the liquid into a bowl. To liquid add  lemon juice, tasting carefully and correcting seasonings.    NOTES : To serve the same night, spoon off all visible fat from liquid or,  better yet, place bowl in freezer until fat congeals on top (about 20  minutes).To serve the next day, refrigerate liquid separately from  remaining ingredients. Remove and discard fat from top of liquid. Whichever  technique is used, before serving pour remaining degreased liquid back into  casserole. Cover casserole and reheat in oven until liquid is bubbling  slightly (about 20 minutes if chilled, 5 minutes if unchilled). Serve in  large soup bowls with French bread on the side or on large plates over a  bed of Pilaf. For a thicker, creamy sauce, stir 3/4 cup yogurt into liquid  just before reheating.
