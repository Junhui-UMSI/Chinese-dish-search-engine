Cut meat into two inch pieces, melt fat in cooker, add meat, garlic and  onions to brown lightly. Add seasoning, spice, tomato juice or tomatoes and  water. Place potatoes on top of meat. Place the lid, bring to pressure and  pressure cook for 15 mins. Reduce pressure with cold water. Thicken liquid  with 30gm flour, blended with 4 tbs of cold water. Cook until smooth and  thick, stirring all the time.    Pot-Roasting in a Pressure Cooker A pressure cooker can be used for pot  roasting. Any meat can be roasted in the normal way, and if by chance you  have a less tender piece of meat, then try pot roasting. The method is  simple.    1. Put a little fat at the bottom of the cooker, and turn to medium heat.    2. Brown the meat well in the fat, then lift the meat out of the cooker,  insert the trivet*, add water.    3. Allow 1/2 pint of water for joint that takes up to 15 minutes pressure  cooking and add an additional 1/4 pint water for each 15 minutes over this  eg. for a joint taking 45 minutes, you need 600mls of water.    4. Beef needs 10 minutes per 500gm cooking. Lamb, veal, pork need 12  minutes per 500gm Roasting chicken needs 5 minutes per 500gm.    5. Allow pressure to drop to room temperature. You will find the liquid in  the cooker makes excellent gravy.    6. If pressure is dropped, vegetables can be cooked together at the same  time.    *I think the trivet is a steamer basket that came with our pressure cooker  (probably unnecessary).
