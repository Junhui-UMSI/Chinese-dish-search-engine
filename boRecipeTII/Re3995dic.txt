Crush, mince or press garlic (unless you  prefer the rush of a chunky cut).  Mince herbs, juice lemon.  Add all  ingredients to the olives, mix, and allow to rest for at least an hour if  not overnight.    Serve as a side dish for a big feast, and warn the wimps.  The visible  slices of thin red pepper ought to provide a clear enough warning to all  but the least observant. Enjoy!    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #078    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
