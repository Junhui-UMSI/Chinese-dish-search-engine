Tomato and Cabbage Soup
Flour, Finely chopped cooked, Evaporated milk, Water, Tomato juice, Butter, Salt, Sugar, Bay leaf, Onions, 
Melt butter and blend in flour: add tomato juice and stir over low heat  until mixture boils and thickens. Add bay leaf, onion, salt, and sugar to  evaporated milk, and heat separately in top of double-boiler over hot  water. Just before serving, lift out the bay leaf and add cabbage and water  (I use the cooking water from cabbage). Slowly stir the tomato mixture into  the milk and cabbage. Serve immediately. 5 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 352 by ncanty@juno.com (Nadia I  Canty) on Dec 9, 1997
