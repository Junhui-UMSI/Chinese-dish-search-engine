Recipe by: Gad S. Sheaffer (gss@iil.intel.com) This recipe is common to the  Ethiopian Jews (Phalashi). My understanding is that these are NOT unique to  them.    Sort the lentils and soak in tap water for 30 minutes. Rinse in running  water and drain.    Peel and finely chop the onions. peel and mash the garlic.Heat the oil in  large pan and saute the onion until golden. Add tomato paste and paprika  and mix. Add half the water and the garlic,ginger pepper and salt. Stir  well and then add the rest of the water, stir again ,cover and bring to  boil.    When the water boil, add the lentils ,lower the flame and cook 20-30  minutes, until the lentils soften. Serve hot.
