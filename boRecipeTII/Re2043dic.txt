Alligator Stew
Alligator tenderloin  tail, milk, Salted cold water, olive oil, Chicken broth, Onion, Garlic, white pepper, Ground cumin, Oregano flakes, Diced green chiles, Ripe tomato, Cajun Seasoning, 
Trim and cut the alligator into 1 inch cubes. Place in a large pot and  cover with the salted water for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove and drain  well. Put it back in the empty pot and cover with the milk. Let it stand  for another 1 to 1/2 hours. Remove and drain well. In a large pot over high  heat saute the alligator in the olive oil until all the liquid is gone and  the meat is starting to brown lightly. Remove from the heat and pour off  any excess oil. Add the onions and saute until just crispy tender. Add all  the remaining ingredients except the cornstarch , reduce the heat and  simmer covered until the meat is very tender but not falling apart. About 1  to 2 hours.The liquid should cook down by about 1/3. Mix the corn starch  with a little water or chicken broth and thicken the sauce if you wish. I  dont like it too thick. Serve 6 to 8.
