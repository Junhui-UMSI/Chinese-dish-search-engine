White Chocolate-Coconut Truffles
unsalted butter, Vanilla extract, Coconut liqueur, egg yolk, White chocolate, sweetened coconut, 
Melt the butter in a heatproof bowl over very hot, not  simmering, water. Add the white chocolate and melt,  stirring occasionally, just until smooth. Remove from  the heat and whisk in 1/4 cup of the coconut, the egg  yolk, coconut liqueur, and vanilla. The mixture may  separate, but keep whisking and it will come together.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until  firm, at least 3 hours or overnight. Using a melon  baller, scoop up the mixture and roll into 1-inch  balls. Roll each ball in the remaining coconut,  pressing the coconut on so it will adhere. Refrigerate  until ready to serve. (The truffles can be prepared up  to 3 days ahead, tightly covered, and refrigerated, or  frozen for up to 1 month. Makes about 30 truffles.
