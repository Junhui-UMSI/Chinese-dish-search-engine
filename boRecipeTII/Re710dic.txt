Green Pea Soup
Fresh peas, Spring onions, Salt, Brown sugar, Soya flour, Fresh mint or sage., Vegetable stock, 
Clean and chop the spring onions and gently fry them in a little of the  stock for a minute. Add the shelled peas, seasoning and rest of the stock.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes. Liquidize or mash with the soya  flour. return to the rinsed pan and reheat, checking seasoning and  consistency.    If the peas are really young, you can boil the pods if fresh and shiny in  the soup and remove before liquidizing, or boil them in the stock before  making the soup, for extra flavour and goodness.
