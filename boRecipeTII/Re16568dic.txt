Aglio Olio Peperoncino
Jalapeno chiles, -(up to), Garlic, Cheap olive oil, 
Aglio Olio Peperoncino (garlic oil with peppers)    I offer a simple recipe which I have cooked about once a week for the last  12 years. Its a derivative of the Italian "Aglio Olio Peperoncino," garlic  oil with peppers. <Eileen> ebanderson@ualr.edu    Put pasta water on to boil. Peel and slice the cloves of one head of  garlic. Slice 5-7 jalapenos into rounds. I leave the seeds in. Saute the  garlic and peppers in about 1/2 cup of cheap olive oil (NOT extra- virgin;  it cant take the heat). Saute to preference: practically raw, soft, or  garlic turning golden. If you like the latter, give the garlic a head start  on the peppers. Boil 1 lb dry pasta: spaghetti is traditional but shells or  penne are good too. Start grating lots of Parmesan cheese. You know the  rest: drain the pasta well, mix the pasta and oil mixture, pile on the  cheese, eat. Hard-core heads will want to use habs, probably. Ive had good  results with serranos and tiny Asian peppers. Just dont used dried; the  dish needs the sweetness of fresh peppers, IMO. Note to the purists: this  is a bastardization. Italians dont generally put Parmesan cheese on aglio  olio, and would probably not cook with these types of hot peppers. Too bad.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
