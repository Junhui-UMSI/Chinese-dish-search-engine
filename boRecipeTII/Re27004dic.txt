Three Pepper Relish
Sweet red pepper, White miso, Red onion, Hot sauce to taste, Yellow pepper, Kuzu dissolved in, Splash of mirin, Green pepper, olive oil, Water, 
Seed, core, and dice peppers and onion into small relish-size pieces. Pour  olive oil into an iron skillet and saute peppers and onions until tender.  Add hot sauce to taste. (Dont be timid, this is a condiment eaten in small  amounts.) Add mirin. Dissolve miso in a few tablespoons of water and add to  peppers. Let this cook for 2-3 minutes and finally add the kuzu. Let kuzu  cook until transparent. Serve as an accompaniment to beans, tempeh, or  rice. This is a great way to add spice to the meal without having to make  every dish spicy.
