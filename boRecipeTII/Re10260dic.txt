Quick and Spicy Beans
Generous tablespoons, Garbanzo beans, Kozlowski Farms South of the, Lentils, Great northern whites, Kidney beans, Border no fat Dressing., Pinto beans, 
Heat all the ingredients.  Simply wonderful.    I attended a McWell potluck last night and the following dish was one of  the biggest hits.  You can make it with fresh beans if you enjoy cooking or  canned are fine as well. I used cans.
