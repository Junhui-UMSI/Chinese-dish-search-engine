Baked Oysters - a Holiday Tradition
Whole Oysters; Drained,, milk, Stick Butter Or Margarine;, Black Pepper; to taste, Evaporated Milk; Approx 1/2, Sleeves Saltine Crackers;, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Into large bowl, combine crackers, drained  oysters, melted butter and black pepper to taste. Stir gently till well  mixed. Add evaporated milk to reserved oyster liquid to make 2 cups. Pour  into cracker-oyster mixture, stir gently to mix well. Spoon mixture into  greased casserole dish ( I use my deep "French White" Pyrex casserole  dish). Pour enough milk over mixture to make it "soupy". Milk should be to  top of mixture. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes until "puffed" and  lightly browned.    (This dish is better too moist than it is too dry. It has taken me several  attempts to get this right because I thought I was adding too much milk to  it. It was always turning out too dry until I let go of my fear of making  it too "soupy". I hardly ever get it to turn out exactly the same every  time, but at least its not too dry anymore!!!)    Notes: It just isnt Thanksgiving or Christmas w/o Moms Baked Oysters!!  This is my absolute favorite holiday dish. I AM thinking of modifying it  the next time by adding about 1/2 cup of thinly sliced, celery.
