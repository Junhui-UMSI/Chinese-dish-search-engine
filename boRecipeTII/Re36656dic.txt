Strawberry Cookie Bars
Pecans, Strawberry jam, Sugar, Flour, Egg yolks, Butter, Salt, 
Hi all, I just tried this recipe on my family today and they raved about  it.  Its very easy to make.  Got it out of the 353rd SOG Spouses Cookbook  from Okinawa, Japan.  I love these fund-raiser cookbooks.    Cream butter, sugar, and egg yolks.  Mix in flour and salt.  Add nuts.  Pat  1/2 of the dough in the bottom of an 8 inch square greased pan.  Spread jam  over the dough.  Top jam with remaining dough spread (spread with hands).  Bake 1 hour at 325 degrees.
