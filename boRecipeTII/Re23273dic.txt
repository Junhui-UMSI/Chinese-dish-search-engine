Dough: Prepare according to your machines instructions for dough.  When  dough is finished, spread onto greased pizza pan. Add toppings. Cook 425,  15-17 min.    Tuna Pizza Topping: Heat olive oil in pan and saute onion, mushroom and  garlic until tender, but not brown. Add tuna, tomato soup and seasonings.  Let cool slightly before spreading onto pizza dough.    This tastes better, I find, topped with cheddar cheese rather than  mozarella.    Now dont squinch up your noses and say "ewwwww" until you try it!    Posted to Digest bread-bakers.v096.n056    Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:24:28 -0400    From: mvinqvist@mta.ca (Mindy)
