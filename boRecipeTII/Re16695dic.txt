Ham; diced, Onion; diced, Red bell pepper; diced, Jalapeno chile pepper; diced, Hot link sausages; diced, Celery; diced, Bottles Alaskan Amber Beer, Creole seasoning, Red beans; cooked, 
In a crockpot or a heavy 3 quart pan place all the ingredients except the  beans to a boil and simmer for an hour or two. Add the beans and simmer for  another hour or two. Mash a few of the beans with a spoon to thicken the  liquid..    Do not use a creole seasoning made with salt. The sausage and ham provide  salt, and more may be added at the table.    Add additional peppers if desired. Serve with rice.    A table of tomato paste may be added near the end of the cooking time.    NOTES : Beans can be cooked to minimize the undigestable sugars that cause  gas.  Put the beans in a pan and cover with water to 2 inches over the dry  beans.  Heat to boiling.  Turn off the heat.  Allow the beans to swell for  about an hour.  Drain the water off and refill with water to cover the  beans. Bring to a boil and allow to set over night or for several hours.  Drain the beans and refill with water to cover and simmer until tender  (about 1 hour). Drain the beans and use in recipes calling for cooked  beans.
