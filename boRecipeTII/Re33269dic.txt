Basic Risotto
Parmesan cheese, olive oil, Chives, Butter, onions, Arborio rice, Chicken stock, Heavy cream, Truffle oil, Chopped parsley, 
Heat chicken broth to simmering in a small saucepan and leave on very low  heat. In a heavy- based, wide saucepan heat olive oil, add onions and cook~  until golden over medium heat. Add rice and stir to coat each and every  grain with oil. Begin by adding 1 cup of hot stock, stirring with a wooden  spoon to mix. Allow this liquid to be absorbed, then add 1/2 cup stock,  stirring until evaporated. Continue to add broth by 1/2 cupfuls, stirring  after each addition. Continue until rice begins to soften. Last addition of  stock should just absorb into rice, leaving it slightly tight. Stirring  quickly with a wooden spoon, add butter and cream . Risotto will become  very creamy. Stir in herbs and cheese. Remove from heat and adjust  seasoning to taste. Serve topped with freshly-grated cheese and drizzle  with truffle oil, if using.
