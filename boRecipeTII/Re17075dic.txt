A few years ago my adult son and I went into a food fair in Sydney  Australia. At an Indian stand he asked the waiter. What he Vindaloo was?  The answer cameback ******* hot mate! We tasted it and it was!! Ever since  then anything hot has been called "Vinaloo Mate"    "My chille is Vindaloo Buba"    Here is a recipe from my Indian Cookbook.    Put the Ginger,garlic, chille powder, turmeric, salt, cardamom, cloves  peppercorns,cinnamon,coriander, cummin seeds and vinegar into a blender and  blend to a pur?e. Scrape down the sides of the blender and blend for a  further 30seconds. Add more vinegar if necessary to form a smooth liquid  paste. Put the pork in a large bowl and pour over the spice paste. Cover  and set aside to marinate for 1 hour. Lay the curry leaves if you are using  them, on top. Re-cover and put the bowl into the refrigerator for 24 hours,  turning the meat 2 or 3 times during the period. Two hours before cooking  time, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and set aside. Heat the oil in  a large saucepan. Add the mustard seeds and cover the pan. Fry the seeds  until they pop, then add the pork, marinade and water. Bring to the boil,  stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer for a  further 30 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and tender. Transfer  the Vindaloo to a warmed serving dish and serve at once. 4 to 6 servings.  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #294 by Tony Flynn <flynnaj@xtra.co.nz> on  Apr 15, 1997
