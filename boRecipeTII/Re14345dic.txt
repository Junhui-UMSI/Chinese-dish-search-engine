Whole or Baked Garlic
Olive oil or butter, Black Pepper, Whole heads garlic, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Remove the thin papery outer skin that covers each whole head of garlic.  (Either peel it off starting from the root or take a knife and cut around  the covering midway up the head, then peel off the outer skin.) Place the  heads in a small baking dish. Drizzle a little oil or butter over them and  sprinkle on salt and pepper. Bake 1 to 2 hours, depending on size, until  tender. Serve one head per person.    To cook in a microwave, drizzle the peeled garlic heads with oil and cook 1  to 12 minutes at full power.
