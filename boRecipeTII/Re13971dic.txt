Winstons Chili
Beer, ADD, Paprika, Tabasco, Red peppers, Jalapeno peppers, Brown sugar, Batch of your favorite basic, 
SERVES 4      Fred Winston, a Chicago disc jockey and man about town, makes the basic  chili recipe sing with the addition of beer, paprika, jalape?o peppers,  Tabasco, red peppers, and brown sugar. Yes, this all goes into the same pot  with the normal chili recipe. It is really a very good dish. He even sells  the stuff! I am telling you this so that you will gain some nerve in your  chili cooking. I have heard of everything going into a chili pot, including  peanut butter.      Fred, do you think peanut butter is a bit strange for chili? I didnt  think you would.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
