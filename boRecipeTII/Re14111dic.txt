White Chocolate-Mocha-Hazelnut Truffles
Hazelnuts, white ?, Instant coffee powder, White chocolate, Heavy cream, GANACHE, COATING, 
To prepare ganache: Place chocolate in a deep bowl and set aside in a warm  place. Combine cream and coffee powder in a medium saucepan and bring just  to a boil over medium-high heat. Immediately pour over chocolate, stirring  until smooth. (If all of the chocolate doesnt melt, place chocolate over a  bowl of hot water and stir until melted.) Stir in liqueur. Cover and  refrigerate for 4 hours, or freeze for 1 hour, until firm. Using a melon  baller or a teaspoon, scoop out small 3/4-inch portions of the ganache.  Roll each portion into a ball between your palms and place on a wax  paper-lined baking tray. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate  until firm. To make coating: Spread hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast  in 350-degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until  lightly browned. Remove from oven and rub in a kitchen towel to remove  skins. (Some flecks of skins can remain.) Finely chop nuts and set aside.  Chop half the chocolate and place in a heavy saucepan. Break the remaining  cho colate into large chunks. Over low heat, melt the chocolate in the pan,  stirring, just until smooth. Remove pan from heat. Working with a few  pieces at a time, add chunks of chocolate and stir. Add chocolate until  chunks no longer melt when stirred in. (This is tempering chocolate so it  will stand without softening at room temperature. If desired, simply dip  truffles in melted white chocolate and store in the refrigerator.) Dip  ganache centers in white chocolate, rolling to coat, then roll in chopped  hazelnuts. Let stand until set, or refrigerate.
