Yogurt Sauce
Salt, Unsalted butter, Plain yogurt, Finely minced garlic, Chopped fresh mint, 
Aushak is an Afghani and Persian dish consisting of ravioli filled with  leeks, etc. with a meat tomato sauce *and* a yogurt sauce.  It is  excellent! Here is a recipe for the yogurt sauce that goes with Aushak,  which may help you a bit in figuring out the yogurt sauce you had.    Melt the butter over low heat in a small saute pan or skillet.  Add the  garlic and cook 1 to 2 minutes without coloring.  Cool for a few minutes  and then add the yogurt.  Stir in the chopped mint and season to taste with  salt and pepper.
