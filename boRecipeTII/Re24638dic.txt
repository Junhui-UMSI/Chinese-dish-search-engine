Aspargus Spears with Sesame Mayonaise
Mayonnaise, Asparagus Spears, Sesame oil, Grated Zest Of 1 Orange, Soy sauce, 
Pour about 1 inch of water into a large frying pan and bring it to a boil  over high heat. Meanwhile, cut off the tough bottom ends from the aspargus.  Generously salt the water. Add the aspargus, return the water to a boil and  cook until the aspargus is just tender, about 3 minutes. Drain the aspargus  and rinse under cold running water. Drain well and pat dry. In a small  bowl, combine the mayonaise, soy sauce, sesame oil and grated orange zest.  Blend well. Spoon the dipping sauce into a small bowl. Place the bowl in  the middle of a round platter and fan the asparagus spears on the platter  around it.
