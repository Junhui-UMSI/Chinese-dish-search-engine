No one knows the exact point of origin for this fantastic meatless stew. As  entire tribes and families from different regions of Africa were forced on  a journey to the New World, old recipes with gathered or grown ingredients  from respective homelands transformed into new concoctions containing  common foods found in the Americas.    Prepare this tasty stew tonight as a much updated version of a traditional  African recipe as our salute to Black History Month continues at  Recipe-a-Day.com.    In a large cooking pot over medium heat warm oil and saute onion, garlic  and white stems of chard until wilted, about 5-minutes. Add chopped greens  and continue to saute. Add beans or peas, raisins, yams, tomatoes, salt and  pepper. Continue to saute for 3 to 5-minutes. Make a well in the center of  the mixture and add rice to the well. Pat rice down with a wooden spoon  until moist. Cover and cook until rice is complete, about 25-minutes. Check  mixture occasionally and add water 2 Tbs. at a time if rice is dry and  starting to stick during cooking. Add Tabasco sauce to taste and serve.
