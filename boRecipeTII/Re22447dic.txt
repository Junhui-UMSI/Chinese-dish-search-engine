In return, heres what I made for dinner last night, cut out of Better  Homes and Gardens:    In a large saucepan combine beans, undrained tomatoes, vinegar, rosemary  and red pepper; heat to boiling. Serve with a slotted spoon. If desired,  sprinkle with black pepper; garnish with rosemary. Makes 3 cups.    Note: I took advantage of all the liquid and served it over orzo. It made 2  good size servings.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 05 Sep 96    From:    Cheryl Mainard <cmainard@ARTIC.EDU>    Date:    Thu, 5 Sep 1996 13:08:15 -0500
