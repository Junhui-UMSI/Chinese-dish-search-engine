No matter what kind of dehydrator, the difference between a flexible jerky  and a brittle one is a very short period of time.  Ours takes about  5  hours, although the dehydrator manual says it takes 8.    And remember not to be afraid to play around with the mix; what Ive gave  you will be close to store-bought in taste, but I add extra sugar for  winter jerky (somehow sugar seems to warm), more teriyaki sauce and less  soy to cut out the salt.    Ham jerky a friend makes is really greasy so I pass, but venison jerky will  dry a lot faster than beef so watch it closely until you get to know your  dehydrator.  When jerky gets brittle it crumbles in your mouth instead of  being chewy.    We just store in it a plastic zip baggie; it doesnt last long enough for  me to tell you how long it will keep.
