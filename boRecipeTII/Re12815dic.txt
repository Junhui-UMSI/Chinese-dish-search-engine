Yummy Fillo Filling #3
Scallions, White fish, Horseraidh, Broken shrimp, Dijon mustard, Cream cheese, White pepper, 
Cook whitefish, scallions, shrimp in peanut or corn oil. Add rest of  ingredients, mix well over low heat. Refrigerate until cooled. Fill Fillos.    I made all three of the above for a painting party saturday and it was  enough for 3 lbs of fillo, using three-one-third-sheet triangles for each.
