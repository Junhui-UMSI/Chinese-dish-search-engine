Peanutty Playdough
Powdered sugar, Light corn syrup, Dried Milk Powder, Creamy Peanut Butter, 
Assorted cake sprinkles or small candies .    Note: This mixutre is too thick for most electric mixers, so mix by hand,  kneading works best.    Mix first four ingredients together until smooth. Divide into 10 15  portions. Children can mold and shape into animals, flours, cars, etc.,  then decorate and eat!
