The use of instant polenta in this recipe from Carol Fields "Italy in  Small Bites," is strictly optional. If you prefer, make it the  traditional way. Just be sure to warm up your stirring arm in advance.    Soak dried mushrooms in warm water to cover at least 45 minutes or  until softened. Remove from liquid carefully and rinse well under  cold running water to remove any sand still clinging. Chop mushrooms  roughly and drain thoroughly. Strain soaking liquid at least twice  through sieve lined with cheesecloth or paper towels, and reserve for  use in another dish.    Heat olive oil in heavy skillet and saute onion until translucent and  tender, 10-15 minutes. Add garlic and all mushrooms, turn heat to low  and cook, stirring intermittently, for up to 20 minutes, until  tender. Add tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Continue  cooking another 5 minutes.    Cut Quick Polenta into slices 2" wide and 3-4" long and brush lightly  with olive oil to taste. Broil until firm and lightly crisp on both  sides. Place spoonful of hot mushroom sauce on top of each crostino  and serve.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
