Yucca Sancochada
Lemon juice, Hot water, Salt, Yucca, 
This comes from a cookbook called All About Cuban Cooking.    Peel and cut yucca in big pieces. Place water in a big pot and bring to a  boil with the salt and lemon juice. Add yucca and cook for about 45  minutes. Add cold water once in awhile, about a fourth cup at a time. This  causes the yucca to split and become tender. Yucca can also be fried. Drain  and serve with mojo.    Posted to recipelu-digest by vergie1@juno.com (Vergie A Ewing) on Feb 4,  1998
