Cut the alligator into 1/2" thick steaks and tenderize by pounding with a  meat mallet for a minute or two. Cut each steak into strips about the size  of your baby finger. Combine the lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a  mixing bowl. Add the alligator, making sure its coated with the marinade.  Marinate the gator in this mixture for 30 mins. in the frig, turning once  during this time.    Combine the flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, cayenne, and chili pepper in a  bowl and whisk to mix.    Just before serving, pour the oil to a depth of at least 1" in a small  frying pan or electric skillet, and heat to 350~. Drain the gator and blot  dry. Dredge the gator pieces in flour to cover, shaking off the excess.    Fry the gator pieces, turning with a slotted spoon or wire skimmer, until  golden brown, 1 to 2 mins. total. Work in several batches, so as not to  crowd the pan. Drain on paper towels and serve at once.
