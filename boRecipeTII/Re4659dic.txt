For Pheasant Stock:  ===================         Preheat oven to 450 F.         Pour the vegetable oil into a roasting pan with the bones and  carcasses of the two deboned pheasants.  Roast until well browned,  stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.         Add remaining stock ingredients except the wine and continue to  roast for 10 more minutes.         Transfer solids to a stockpot, discarding any fat.         Place the roasting pan over high heat and add wine.  Scrape away  all browned bits and boil, stirring, until wine is nearly evaporated.         Add 1 cup of water, and add this liquid to the stockpot.         Add cold water to cover, bring slowly to a boil, and skim well.         Lower heat, and simmer uncovered, 3 to 4 hours.         Strain the mixture, pressing down on solids to extract all of the  liquid; discard solids.  Cool to room temperature and refrigerate.         When chilled, lift off any solidified fat from the surface and  discard.         Go on to the next recipe to prepare the Stuffing.
