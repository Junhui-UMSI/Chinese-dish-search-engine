Each salt and pepper, including stems, olive oil, Fresh Cilantro, including stems, Small green chili peppers, ;(I used abt. 30 jalapenos), about 1/2 bunch, Chopped parsley, Ground cumin, Garlic; minced, (abt. 12 large cloves), 
In blender, puree enough chili peppers to measure one cup when done. Puree  parsley & cilantro together; blend well w/the pureed chili peppers. Add  garlic, seasonings & olive oil. Again blend well.    Store zhoug, refrigerated.  Will remain fresh for many months.    Yield:  1 1/2 cups.    The authors write: "Spicy zhoug is a source of pride among the Yemenite  population.  Made with the sharpest of chili peppers, it is eaten with  classically oriental Jewish meals.    "More than just a condiment, zhoug is a tradition. Yemenites believe that  daily consumption of zhoug wards off disease and strengthens the heart.  Zhoug can be an addition to salads and a sauce for various kinds of meat,  fish, and poultry dishes."    Caution:  While quite hot, this stuff is addictive! Its excellent  slathered on Saltines and accompanied by a cold brewski. Ive seen people  go through entire containers of zhoug, which was nicknamed "Truth or Dare"  here to separate the wheat from the chaff as far as heat lovers go.
