What a hoot!    "Its Fun To Serve," for instance, details how to bring joy to your table  by placing & removing various dishes swiftly and with grace." Also  included are sections on the correct order in which to wash your dishes and  cupboard organizational charts (oh yeah. . . my cupboards are exactly like  this - HA!).    The notebook does contain some very basic recipes that held up when my  parents gamely ate them so many years ago, and are still quite tasty.    Some of them sound a bit odd, but I suppose they wanted to provide recipes  that pre-teens would find interesting and easy to prepare.    Since many of us are at boiling point, weather-wise, heres an easy way to  keep the kitchen cool:    Melt chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in top of double boiler.  When  melted, mix in remaining ingredients.  Drop mixture by spoonfuls on waxed  paper.  Put in refrigerator and let set.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 292    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
