Cream together shortening, sugar and eggs. Add vanilla and stir in peanut  butter. Sift dry ingredients and stir into creamed mixture. Shape into  balls, about 1 tsp each, and put on ungreased sheet. Press kisses in center  so dough will form over edge. Bake 10-12 min. at 350*.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #416 by slea@hightowerservices.com (Shawn  Zehnder Lea) on Nov 25, 1997
