EMERIL LIVE SHOW #EMIB26 CHINESE CUISINE    Preheat the fryer. In a wok heat the oil. When the oil is hot, add the  pork. Season with salt and pepper. Stir fry for 3 minutes. Add the onions  and garlic, continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the cabbage and shrimp.  Season with salt and pepper. Stir fry for 1 minute. Season with the soy  sauce, sake and sugar. Add the sprouts and green onions and mix thoroughly.  Remove from the heat and cool completely. To assemble, spoon about 1/4 cup  of the filling in a rectangular shape on the center of each wrapper. Fold  in the ends toward the center about 1/4-inch. Then, beginning at the  bottom, roll up the wrapper, like a jelly roll, using a little of the egg  wash to seal the end tightly. Repeat until all of the egg rolls are done.  Fry the egg rolls in batches until golden brown, stirring occasionally for  overall browning, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on  paper towels. Season the egg rolls with Essence. Serve warm with the two  sauces.
