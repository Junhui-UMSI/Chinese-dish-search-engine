Place shrimp in a small baking dish just large  enough to hold them in one layer. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and salt and  pepper to taste. Toss to make sure shrimp are coated with bread crumbs Cut  margarine into pieces and divide it among the shrimp. Pour wine into the  baking dish and bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven and turn on broiler.  Sprinkle top with Parmesan cheese and place under broiler for 5 to 10  seconds. Watch them carefully. They will brown quickly.
