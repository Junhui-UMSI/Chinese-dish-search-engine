Heat a large saute pan and add olive oil.  Saute the onion, toasted  garlic, cloves, bay leaves, and allspice for about 10 minutes. (Do not  brown.)         Meanwhile, heat the fish stock (or chicken) in a saucepan.         To the saute pan, add 1 bunch of coriander (tied together), all of the  clams, and the grilled tomatoes.  Turn the heat up to high and bring to a  boil.         Add 2 cups of heated fish stock, cover, and steam to open the clams  (about 5 minutes).  Replenish fish stock as needed to keep ingredients  covered.         Add the angler fish, lime juice (to taste), and chilies.  If  necessary, add more coriander and roasted garlic.  Continue cooking for 2  minutes, then bring to a rolling boil and add mussels.         (Note: Mussels open quickly.)         Add the remainder of the fish (tuna or cod), then lobster, shrimp,  oysters, and squid.  (Note: All fish should have the skin removed and be  cut into 1-inch cubes.)         Remove tied bunch of coriander, then cook covered for 2-3 minutes and  serve.         Garnish with fresh coriander.
