Mix thoroughly, then form into small  balls each about the size of a small walnut.    2. Film the bottom of a large skillet with the oil. Add the meatballs, turn  heat to moderate, and brown the meatballs slowly, turning them so that they  brown evenly on all sides. As the meatballs brown, remove them from the pan  with a slotted spoon and set aside.    3. When all the meatballs have been browned, pour off and discard the fat  in the pan leaving just enough to film the bottom. Add the chopped onion,  garlic, gingerroot. and hot peppers. Saute, stirring, over moderate heat  until the onion begins to turn gold.    4. Add the chopped peppers and saute a few minutes. Add the meatballs and  the drained pineapple chunks to the pan.    5. In a small bowl combine the pineapple juice, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar,  and corn-starch. Mix until thoroughly blended.    6. Turn the heat up to moderately high, and stir the meatballs, pineapple,  and peppers until they are very hot. Pour in the sauce mixture and cook,  stirring, until the sauce is thickened and the meatballs, pineapple, and  peppers are evenly glazed and hot. Serve with plain hot cooked rice.
