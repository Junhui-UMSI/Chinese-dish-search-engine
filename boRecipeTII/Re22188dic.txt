Preheat the oven to 350.  Lay out the turkey slices on a large sheet of  waxed paper or plastic wrap, overlapping them to form a large rectangle.  Cover the turkey with overlapping ham slices. Place the cheese over the  ham.  Be sure to leave a 1/4 inch border all the way around. Sprinkle with  pepper.  Roll to turkey tightly, starting at one of the long sides, using the wrap  to help nudge the meat. Tuck in the ends of the roll to keep the cheese  from leaking out. Discard the paper.  Coat the turkey with the yogurt, then the bread crumbs (note:  I chop up a  tiny amount of sage and mix it in with the breadcrumbs). Place the turkey  roll in a large, shallow baking dish and dribble the olive oil over it.  Bake the roll until firm and springy to the touch -- about 20 minutes.  Remove the roll from the oven and let it rest for five to seven minutes to  allow the melted cheese to fiirm up.  While the turkey roll is baking, prepare the sauce:  combine the scallions  and wine in a small saucepan and reduce the liquid to half. Add the  remaining ingredients and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Cut the turkey in 1/3" slices.  Arrange the slices on a heated serving  dish, ladle on the hot sauce and garnish with fresh sage.      234    calories  10 grams of fat  Recipe By     : "Fresh Ways with Poultry"    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n200    Date: Sun, 27 Oct 1996 15:30:41 -0500    From: Kathie Briggs <kjbriggs@voyager.net>    Serving Ideas : Serve with Pasta and Broccoli, Squash Puree    NOTES : This is nice for just about any holiday.
