Pollo Deshebrada (Shredded Chicken)
garlic, Black Pepper, Salt, chicken, (Young), Oregano, Bay Leaves, 
In a wide 5 quart pan, arrange the chicken quarters in a single layer. Add  cold water to cover by one inch (about 2 1/2 quarts) and set over medium  heat. Stir in the giblets, garlic, oregano, salt, freshly ground black  pepper, and bay leaves and bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pan and  lower the heat. Simmer the chicken, turning it once at the halfway point,  until the meat is tender and falling from the bone, about 25 minutes.    Remove the pan from the heat, set on a rack, and let the chicken cool to  room temperature, uncovered, in the poaching liquid. Drain the chicken and  strain and degrease the broth, reserving it for another use. Skin the  chicken, remove and shred the meat. Cover and refrigerate. The chicken can  be cooked up to 1 day ahead.    NOTES : Here is a method for cooking and shredding chicken to be used in  tacos, quesadillas, flautas, burritos, and so on. Be certain to save the  broth (there will be about 2 quarts) for use in soups. Though the meat will  not be as moist (and there wont be a bonus of broth), if time is tight you  might want to substitute an already roasted chicken from the supermarket.  Just discard the skin, pull the meat from the bones, and shred it.    Recipe by: El Paso Chile Co.s TX Border Ckbk/W. P.
