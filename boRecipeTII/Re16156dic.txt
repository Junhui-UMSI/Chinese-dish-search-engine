Warm Walnut Dressing
Italian dressing, Walnuts, Maple syrup, Peanut oil, Honey, 
In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the oil and walnuts over medium heat  until the nuts are slightly browned. Add the remaining ingredients; reduce  the heat to low and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes, or until heated through.    NOTE: Try serving this over lettuce with a topping of orange slices or  pitted dark cherries for a combination of hot and cold, tart and sweet.  This also works as a sauce to fancy up chicken, turkey, or pork. And sure,  you can use pecans or cashews instead of walnuts, if youd prefer.
