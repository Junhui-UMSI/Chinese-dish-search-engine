Since my sister says I cannot post her chocolate chip mondel bread recipe,  here is a recipe from todays Washington Post which is more of the same!    Transfer squash to 2 qt. pan and add "A".    Simmer covered for 15 minutes. Then puree 2 minutes until smooth and  creamy. Add "B".    Simmer soup for 5 minutes.    Ladle soup into 2 bowls and garnish with dill sprigs or whatever. Serve  with crusty bread. Enjoy!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Shelley L. Madden" <shelleym3@hotmail.com>  on Oct 14, 1998,
