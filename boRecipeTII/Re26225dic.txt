Tomatillo and Green Chile Salsa
Water, cilantro, green chiles, Salt, tomatillos, Garlic, white onion, 
In the open flame of a gas burner or under a preheated broiler, roast the  long green chiles, turning them, until they are lightly but evenly charred.  Steam the chiles in a paper bag, or in a bowl, covered with a plate, until  cool. Rub away the burned peel. Stem and seed the chiles and coarsely chop  them. There should be about 1/2 cup.    In a medium saucepan, cover the tomatillos with water. Set the pan over  medium heat, bring to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, about 10 minutes, or  until the tomatillos are soft. Drain and cool them.    In a blender, combine the tomatillos, green chiles, water, garlic, and  salt, and puree on high speed until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in  the onions and cilantro. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Adjust  the seasoning. The salsa can be prepared up to 2 days ahead without loss of  flavor or texture.
