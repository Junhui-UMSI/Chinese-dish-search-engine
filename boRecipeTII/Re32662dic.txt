Sweet Pickles #2
Salt, Sliced cucumbers; about, Lime, Mustard seed, Oil of cinnamon, Celery seed, Water, Sugar, Oil of cloves, Cider vinegar, 
Soak cucumbers overnight in water & lime. Next morning, wash cucumbers well  & soak in ice water for 3 hours. In the meantime, make a syrup of the rest  of the ingredients. (You may tie the celery & mustard seed in a piece of  cheesecloth so the seeds will not be in your pickles later, if desired.)  Soak cucumbers in the syrup for 4 hours. Simmer for 1 hour & pack in  sterilized, hot jars. Be sure & cover the cucumbers with syrup after  putting them into jars. This recipe makes over 10 pints.
