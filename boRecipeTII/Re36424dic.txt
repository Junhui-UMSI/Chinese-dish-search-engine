August 13, 1997    >From Peter LaBarbara, Homewood    1. In a large mixing bowl, beat 1 cup butter with an electric mixer at high  speed for 1 minute. Add brown sugar and beat for 1 minute. Stop the mixer;  using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl.    2. Beat in eggs one at a time, again stopping to scrape down the bowl. Stir  in nuts and dates.    3. In another large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, allspice,  cloves and salt. With mixer running, add flour mixture to butter mixture  alternately with beer until well-blended.    4. Pour batter into a greased 12-cup tube pan. Bake in a preheated  325-degree oven for 30 minutes. Raise oven temperature to 350 degrees and  continue baking until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the cake  comes out clean, about 25 minutes.    5. Remove cake from pan. Cool completely on a wire rack.  Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Mar 06, 1998
