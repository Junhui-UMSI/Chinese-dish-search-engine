~Beverly has known the Cuccias for years.  Vicki graciously gave her the  recipe.  Its an all day soup, slow simmer, it needs skimming. You could  substitute meaty bones. Beef base is sold retail at quantity grocers and  membership stores. This recipe does not use instant barley.    ~ Put bones in soup kettle and cover with water.  Bring to boil, cover and  reduce heat to simmer for 4 hours.  Skim foam as it appears.  Add tabasco,  beef base, salt and pepper.  Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.    ~ Strain broth and scrape any meat from bones.  Put strained broth and bits  of meat into pot.  Add onions, carrots, celery, potatoes and barley. Bring  to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 1 hour or until barley is cooked.  Add tomato paste and simmer another 15 minutes.    (Press Enterprise - 9 May 1996)
