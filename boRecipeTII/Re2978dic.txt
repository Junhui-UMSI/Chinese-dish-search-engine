Use a medium bowl with an electric mixer  beat the butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, egg and vanilla until the  mixture is light and fluffy. Sift the flour, baking soda and nutmeg into  the peanut-butter mixture. Add the sesame seeds. Stir until just combined.  Use your hands to form 1" balls of dough. Dip each ball into the beaten egg  white.  Then roll it in the wheat germ.  Place the balls on lightly greased  cookie sheets 1" to 2" apart.  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
