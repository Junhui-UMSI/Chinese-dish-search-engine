Quick Christmas Tree Bread
All-purpose flour, (4 ounces) diced dried fruit, Granulated sugar or homemade, Granulated sugar, Salt, Egg, yolk and white, (1 stick) cold, unsalted, milk, Baking Powder, Pumpkin pie spice or ground, 
Check to see that one rack is in bottom third of oven and heat oven to 425  degrees F.    Measure milk in a 2-cup measure, add sugar and egg yolk, stir to mix well.  Stir in dried fruit. Let stand until ready to use.    Put flour, baking powder, spice, and salt into a large bowl, stir to mix  well. Add butter and cut in with pastry blender or rub in with fingers,  until mixture looks like fine granules.    Stir milk mixture and pour over flour mixture. Stir with a fork until a  soft dough forms. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and give 10  kneads. (If very sticky, let stand 3 or 4 minutes or add a little more  flour.) Cut off about one-fourth of the dough. Put remaining dough on an  ungreased cookie sheet at least 16 inches long. Using both rolling pin and  fingers, pat and roll dough into a flat triangle about 12 inches long and 9  inches wide across the bottom. With scissors, make about ten diagonal cuts  down each long side of the triangle, cutting to within about 1 inch of the  center.    Shape a small piece of reserved dough into a trunk at bottom of tree and  remaining dough into a "pot." Dough may now be covered with plastic wrap  and refrigerated for a couple of hours or frozen for up to 2 weeks.    Bake tree 10 minutes. Beat egg white with a fork until broken up. Brush  over hot bread, sprinkle with sugar. Bake 5 to 8 minutes longer, until  light brown. With two spatulas, carefully transfer tree to a wire rack. If  possible, cool at least 2 hours before serving. Let guests break off small  pieces.    Yield: 10 to 12 small servings  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #360    Recipe by: COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8772    From: "Angele and Jon Freeman" <jfreeman@netusa1.net>    Date: Mon, 30 Dec 1996 16:53:35 -0500
