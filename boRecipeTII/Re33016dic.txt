Basic Cheesecake Crust
Butter, Sugar, graham crackers, 
Mix the graham crackers and sugar, then add butter and mix with a fork  until completely moistened.  Press mixture into the bottom and up 1/3rd of  the side of a 9-inch springform pan.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.    Variations:  Use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for a spicier  crust or for cakes like pumpkin.  Use chocolate wafers instead of graham  crackers for a chocolate, white chocolate, or certain fruit-flavored or  ~topped cheesecakes like raspberry, cherry, or orange. For a sweeter,  moister crust (do this only if the cheesecake is going to get eaten  quickly, because it gets mushy faster) use brown sugar instead of white.
