Bring bread ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" at 10 oclock. Select "white bread" and push Start.    For best results, use the finest and freshest ingredients available. That  is especially true for this particular recipe.   Lois sister Anita, who loves Italian food, will tell you that this  fabulous bread is well worth the trip to your nearest Italian market or  deli to purchase a chunk of imported Parmesan.   Youll be disappointed with anything less, once youve tried it.    Tested in DAK R2D2.
