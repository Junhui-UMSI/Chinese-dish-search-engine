Venison Jerky
Soy sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, Corn whiskey, Water, venison, Ground red pepper, Salt, garlic, 
Slice the meat when it is lightly frozen. The cuts should be long, thin  and with the grain. Cut across the grain if you want more tender, but more  brittle jerky.    Trim off all of the fat. Marinate strips in a glass container overnight.  You may substitute 2 cups of red wine for the corn whiskey and water.    Pat dry and arrange pieces side by side on an oven roasting rack, with-  out overlap. Cook at minimum heat (150F) for 6 hours. Leave oven door  ajar to allow moisture to escape. Meat should be dark, dry and store  jerky in a cool, airtight container.    Cyberealm Cookbook, Vol 1, 4/93, Cyberealm BBS, compiled by Linda Fields.
