Beef Jerky
Beef (roast), Worstershire sauce, Garlic powder, Black pepper; preferably, Liquid smoke, Red pepper flakes; optional, Soy sauce, Onion powder, 
I make Jerky by buying about 5+ lbs of beef.  Usually a roast. I then  remove the fat. Place the strips of meat into marinade and let soak for  about 24 hours.    Remove from marinade and allow to air dry for at least one hour.    If you have a meat smoker then omit the liquid smoke and smoke meat at a  low temperature.
