Academy Award Crab Cakes
Cayenne pepper powder, Worcestershire Sauce, bread crumbs, Ground thyme, white pepper, Egg, Crab fat, Dungeness crab meat, Dry mustard, Mayonnaise, green onions, Old bay seasoning, 
In a large bowl gently fold all the ingredients together adding the bread  crumbs last. Try not to break the crab meat up into small pieces. Depending  on how moist the crab mixture is you may want to use less. The less bread  crumbs you can use as a binder the better the crab cakes are in my opinion.  I would not add more than a quarter cup. Chill the mixture covered 1 or 2  hours in the refrigerator and they will form a better cake when you are  ready cook them. This is very important. Not only will they form a better  cake but the consistency will be nicer. To cook use enough mixture to form  a large silver dollar sized cake and saute lightly in oil about 1/2 inch  deep ( I prefer a good olive oil ) until golden brown, turning once. These  can be served hot or cold as a main entree or appetizer. Makes about 12  cakes depending on the size.    NOTES : Combination of recipes made 3/28/93-10/2/93-3/26/94 and 7/19/97 I  prefer Dungeness crab meat but will use Blue Crab select lump meat when  available. This is my favorite crab cake as of this writing. I am beginning  to use Japanese Panko in my crab cakes as it seems to be lighter.
