Toffee Biscuits
Flaked; (or slivered), Margarine or butter, Sugar; (I always use castor, Water, 
taken from the Australian Womans Weekly Cook Book    Boil altogether on high until mixture starts to turn brown (dont let it  burn), stir occasionally until a nice deep brown - looks like toffee. Stir  in almonds until all coated and then remove from heat.    Grease foil and place teaspoon fulls of toffee on foil until it sets. They  can be any shape or size - doesnt matter - still tastes good. These can be  iced with melted chocolate if you wish.
