*Leave onion unpeeled, and stud with eight whole cloves.        In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the pieces of  meat for 30 minutes before slicing.        The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and soak  overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature. (This will help  loosen the impurities inside the bones. When heat is applied, these  impurities are released and come to the top much faster and can be removed,  therefore, producing a clear broth.)        Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large stockpot.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes. Drain. Rinse  the pot and the bones.        Return the bones to the pot and add 6 quarts of water. Bring to a boil.  Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat. Stir the bones in the bottom  of the pot from time to time to free the impurities. Continue skimming  until the foam ceases to rise. Add 3 quarts more water and bring to a boil.  Skim off all the residue that forms on the top. Turn the heat to low and  simmer.        Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger directly  over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release their fragrant  odors. Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and cinnamon stick in a  double thickness of dampened cheesecloth. Add the spice bag, parsnips and  salt to the simmer-ing broth. Simmer for 1 hour.        Remove the short rib plates. Pull the meat away from the bones. Reserve  the meat and return the bones to the pot. Simmer the broth, uncovered, for  4 to 5 hours. Keep an eye on it; as the liquid boils away, add enough fresh  water to cover the bones.        Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-thin  slices, roughly 2 by 2 inches in size. Slice the reserved short rib meat  paper-thin. Set aside.        In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the slice  onions. Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and stir in the  hot chili sauce. Blend well.        Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.        When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones. Strain  the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double layer of  dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add the fish sauce and bring the  broth to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep the broth at a bare simmer.        In another pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Drain the noodles,  then drop them in the boiling water. Drain immediately. Divide the noodles  among 4 large soup bowls. Top the noodles with the sliced meats. bring the  broth to a rolling boil. Ladle the broth directly over the meat in each  bowl (the boiling broth will cook the raw beef instantly). Garnish with the  scallion mixture and freshly ground black pepper.        Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the accompaniments on the side.  Each diner will add these ingredients as desired.
