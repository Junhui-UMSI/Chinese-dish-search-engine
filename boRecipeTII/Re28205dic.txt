(combine the butter and flour into a  paste, cook slightly before adding milk). Place the fish in a greased pan  and pour the white sauce over it. Cover and simmer very gently for half an  hour, basting as necessary. Sprinkle with bread crumbs which have been  mixed with the melted butter. Bake in a hot oven for 15 minutes. Remove it  a hot platter and garnish with parsley and lemon.
