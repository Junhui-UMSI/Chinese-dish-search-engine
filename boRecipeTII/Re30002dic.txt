If you like honey, youll  probably like Baklava.      1 Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.      2 Melt the butter over low heat. Pour 2 tablespoons of the butter into the  bottom of a 13 x 9 inch baking pan. Layer 3 sheets of the phyllo dough in  the pan. Trim dough to fit.      3 Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of pecans over the phyllo dough.      4 Layer 3 more sheets of dough and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of pecans.  Continue dough - pecan layers until pan is 3/4 full.      5 With a sharp knife, score phyllo dough to form diamonds. Press a clove at  each end of the diamonds. Pour remaining butter over the dough.      6 Bake 45 to 50 minutes, until dough is golden brown.     7 While dough is baking, combine the sugar, water and cinammon stick in  medium saucepan and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Simmer for 10  minutes.      8 Add the honey and simmer for 2 minutes longer. Remove from heat and  discard cinnamon stick.   9 Pour honey mixture over hot baklava. Let cool on  wire racks.
