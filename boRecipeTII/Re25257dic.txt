Too Sweet Ale
Cascade hops (finish), Northern Brewers hops, Unhopped light extract, Crystal malt, Whitbread ale yeast, Unhopped amber extract, (boil), 
This produced a wonderful beer, except that it was just too sweet for my  likings.  I shouldnt complain too much, all my friends thought  it  was  great!  I tried several variations of this, and all worked out well, but  were  too  sweet for me. Several people suggested cutting  back  on  the  crystal  and I may try that.  I have also tried using a lager  yeast  to  create a steam beer.    Recipe By     : Serving Size:    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
