From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva)    Date: Wed, 4 Aug 93 22:29:33 CDT  Combine gingersnap crumbs, pecans and margarine and press onto bottom and 1  1/2" up the sides of a 9" springform pan. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes.    Combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and vanilla. Mix at medium speed until  well blended. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Reserve 1 cup of batter. Add remaining sugar, pumpkin, and spices to batter  and mix well. Spoon batters alternately over crust and cut through mbatters  with knife to make marble effect. Bake at 350 for 55 minutes. Turn off oven  and leave pan in oven while it cools down. Loosen cake from rim of pan.  Chill. I like to garnish this with little mounds of whipped cream sprinkled  with cinnamon.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
