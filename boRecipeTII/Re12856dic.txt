NOTE: Or other wine or spirit (eg. sherry, Madeira, vermouth, sparkling or  dessert wine) or combine wine with a spirit such as bourbon, rum, or  Calvados, or other brandy, or add a favorite liqueur such as praline or  Frangelico. Citrus juice and zest, vanilla, or ground ginger or other  spices may be added along with the wine.    In a round-bottomed copper zabaglione pan or the top pan of a double  boiler, bombine the egg yolks, sugar and salt. Using a wire whisk or  hand-held mixer, beat until the eggs are pale and creamy, about 3 minutes.  Slowly whisk in the wine.    Place over gently simmering (not boiling) water. Continue to beat  constantly until the custard is thick and doubled in volume, 5 to 8  minutes; it should just hold its shape. Spoon into stemmed glasses or pour  into custard cups and serve warm. Makes 4 servings.    VARIATIONS: For a lighter custard, beat 6 egg whites until stiff peaks  form. Fold them into the warm custard just before serving.    For a cold dessert that holds its shape, remove the warm custard from the  heat and place the pan in a bowl of ice cubes to cool rapidly. beat 2 cups  heavy (whipping) cram until it holds its shape. Using a rubber spatula,  fold the whipped ream into the custard. Cover and chill or freeze. Remove  from the freezer a few minutes before serving.    Serve with fresh beries, sliced peaches or nectarines, poached pears, or  candied fruits. Or offer biscotti or other cookies for dipping into the  custard.
