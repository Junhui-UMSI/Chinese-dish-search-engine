Prep Time: 35 minutes Bake Time: 1 hour 10 minutes Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes Oven Temp: 400F / 200C / Gas Mark 7  Preheat oven.    Cut each of the squash in half and remove  the seeds and fibers.  Place the squash, cut sides down, in an ungreased  baking pan.  Then add water to the depth of 1/4-inch and bake, uncovered,  until the squash is tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.    While the squash is  baking, cook and stir the meat in a large skillet until it is brown.  Drain off the excess fat.  Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in  the 1  ts of salt as well as the cinnamon, the coarsely chopped tart  apples and the raisins.    When the squash is cooked, turn them so that the  cut side is up and remove them to a platter.  Drain off any remaining  liquid in the pan and dry.  Scoop out the pulp from the acorn squash,  making a shell that is 1/4-inch thick all the way around.  Season the  shells with salt to taste.  Mash the pulp and mix in the meat mixture.  Return to the shells, piling them full and sprinkle with 1 tb of brown  sugar on each.  Drizzle with the melted butter.  Bake uncovered until the  apple is tender, about 20 to 30 minutes.  Serve hot.
