Kishke traditionally is prepared by stuffing a seasoned mixture of flour,  onion and meat into casings. This recipe is a flavorful vegetarian version.    Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Spoon half of the mixture onto a  piece of aluminum foil and roll into a cylinder. Repeat with remaining  mixture.    Place cylinders on a cookie sheet or baking pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for  45 minutes.  Turn cylinders upside down and cook for an additional 45  minutes.  Remove and discard foil.    From an old Vegetarian Times magazine.
