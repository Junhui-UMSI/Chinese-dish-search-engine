BASIC RECIPE, milk, Sugar, Green cardamom pods, Pistachio nuts, AAM KULFI (MANGO KULFI, milk, Sugar, Nutmeg, Ripe, sweet mangoes (pulp), KESARI KULFI (SAFFRON KULFI, Saffron threads, Heavy cream, 
Place the milk in a medium-sized heavy pan over high heat.   Bring to a full boil while stirring constantly to prevent a skin from forming.      Lower the heat and continue boiling gently 45-60 minutes, until the milk is reduced to 1 3/4 cups; stir frequently to keep the milk from sticking and burning or boiling over.    When the milk is reduced sufficiently, stir in the sugar and ground cardamom and let stand until completely cool.      Divide the mixture evenly among four small (about 1/2 cup) flan molds or muffin tins.    Cover tightly with foil or plastic wrap and place in the freezer for at least four hours.      To serve, dip the molds into boiling water for a few seconds to release the kulfi.  Transfer to individual serving plates, garnish with the sliced pistachios (if used) and serve at once.      For the Aam Kulfi (Mango Kulfi): Proceed as above, folding in the nutmeg and mango pulp before transferring the mixture to FIVE molds.    Makes 5 portions.      For the Kesari Kulfi (Saffron Kulfi): Follow the top recipe exactly, but fold in 1/2 tsp. crushed saffron threads and 1/2 heavy cream before filling the molds.    Makes 4 portions.
