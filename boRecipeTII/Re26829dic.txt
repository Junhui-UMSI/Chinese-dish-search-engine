Baked Bananas (r T)
Bananas, Brown sugar, Apple Juice; Frozen, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Honey, 
Preheat oven to 350 deg F. Place the bananas, peeled and halved lengthwise,  in pan. Spread bananas evenly with the other ingredients. Bake 15 - 20 min  until juice and honey are melted, and bananas are browned.    This was very good. If I make it again I would double the sauce as there is  not really much for each serving as it is.
