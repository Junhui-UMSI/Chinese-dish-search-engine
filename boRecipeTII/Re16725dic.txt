Alcatraz Wheat Beer
Dried wheat extract, Wyeast Wheat beer yeast, Barley malt, Dried malt extract, Mt. Hood hops, Wheat malt, 
Make a yeast starter two days beforehand. Mash the three pounds of  malt a  la Miller. Boil for one hour, adding 1-1/2 ounces hops at the  start, 1/2  ounce  at 30 minutes, and 1/2 ounce at 5 minutes.  Cool  and  pitch yeast.  Ferment. Bottle. I primed half the batch (5 gal) with 1/3 cup corn sugar  and  the  other half with 1/2 cup clover honey. After two weeks, the beer  was  great. The beer primed with honey, however, was way too carbonated.  All you can taste is bubbles. In direct taste tests, this beer has more  body  than WheatHook, and is slightly sweeter. Compared to EKU, the beer is  similar, but EKU Wiezen is slightly sweeter.
