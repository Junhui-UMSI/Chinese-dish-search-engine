Ok here is my Asapargus Recipe. Its really good, esp. for people that  normally dont like it. I used to hate the green stuff but with this I am  in heaven. This goes really well with any chicken dish or Italian Dish with  pasta..    Time: 25-30 Min Tops    In 10" skillet place asparagus spears add enough water to cover. Bring to a  full boil. Cook over med heat until asparguas is crisply tender (5-7 min.)  Drain, return to skillet. Add remaining ingreds. pushing asparagus to side  just until the butter is melted. Cook over med. heat stirring occasionly  until heated through (5-7 min).    One thing I do is combine all the ingred. in a small dish while the  asparagus is cooking then put it the skillet.
