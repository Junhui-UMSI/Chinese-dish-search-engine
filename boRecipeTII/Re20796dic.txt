Salt, Flour, Baking Powder, Icing sugar or syrup, milk, Egg, Apples (up to 6), Sugar, 
Make a batter by combining the flour, sugar, milk, baking powder, salt and  egg. Core and peel the apples, then slice them and put them into the  batter. Drop them by spoonfuls into 1 inch of fat or oil in a frying pan.  Test the apples with a fork - they are done when soft. Drain them on paper  towels or in a colander. Sprinkle the fritters with icing sugar or eat them  with syrup. This recipe makes about 4 skillets full.
