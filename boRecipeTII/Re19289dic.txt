I have just come across this recipe for Pareve Vegetable Soup. from The  Bulletin, Aug. 23, l974-- an old one -- all these reciopes are from the  same source.    Saute onion in melted margarine in a large pot, until transparent. add  remaining vegetables except potatoes & tomatoes, and cook 10 minutes,  stirring constantly. Add potatoes, water, seasonings and tomatoes. Simmer  until vegetables are tender. Serve hot.
