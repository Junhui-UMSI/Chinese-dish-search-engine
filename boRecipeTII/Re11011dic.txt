Cream together the butter and sugar, slowly add egg yolks, nutmeg and  lemon rind.  Stir this mixture into sifted flour and fold in the stiffly  beaten egg whites. The dough will be soft but manageable. If too soft,  cover the bowl and chill for several hours. Roll out small amounts of the  dough at a time on a floured board, keeping the rest chilled until ready to  use. Roll dough about 1/4 inch thick and cut into strips 1 X 6". Fold the  strips in half and twist them several times, twisting them together.   Fry until golden brown in oil heated to 375 degrees F. When done, remove  from oil and drain on paper towels. Dust generously with sifted powdered  sugar. Keep fresh in a covered tin. Make 7 dozen.
