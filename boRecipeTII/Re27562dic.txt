The Ark Barbeque Sauce
Prepared mustard, Tomato sauce, garlic, Tomato ketchup, Onion, Liquid smoke, Tabasco, Brown sugar, White vinegar, 
Combine everything in a large pot and mix well. Bring mixture to rolling  boil over high heat, stirring frequently from bottom to keep onions and  garlic from settling to the bottom and scorching. When it boils, turn heat  down and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Take from heat; cool at room temperature.  Once cooled, cover and refrigerate. It will keep well for up to a month if  covered properly refrigerated.    Serve this sauce with oysters in the shell or with prawns in a casserole.  Oysters, fresh  shucked and topped with this sauce and then with parmesan  cheese, are wonderful.    Another idea for serving: spread the sauce lightly on 6-8 oz salmon fillets  in a baking dish and bake for about 12 minutes in a 425 degree oven.    Wonderful on sliced beef or chicken for quick lunch sandwiches.    Cut French bread, spread the sauce on it, add Double Gloucester or  Leicester cheese and toast/broil from the top.    Or put poached egg on bread or English muffin, spread sauce over the egg,  add grated cheddar cheese, top with jalapeno slices and toast/broil till  the cheese melts. Serve with chilled fruit for a perfect breakfast.    Source: From The Ark Restauant CookBook: The Ark, Cuisine of the Pacific  Northwest, by J. Lucas & N.

Those who taste it for the first time get       wide eyes,       moan quietly and eat till they can no longer focus their eyes at       all.       Veterans just eat and eat and eat.
