Use ground round or ground sirloin. If using a fattier meat, drain very  thoroughly. Brown beef in a skillet; drain thoroughly. Add the sauce,  seasoning spice and drained green chiles which have been chopped fine.  Simmer for 10 minutes. Mix ricotta cheese and eggs in small bowl, blending  well. Use 2 pie-plates or similar sized oven proof dishes. Place 1/2 cup of  the sauce in each, spreading to cover bottom of dish.    Place one tortilla in each dish. Spread with 1/8th of the ricotta-egg  mixture. Top with about 1/3 cup of meat sauce mixture, 1/3 cup grated  cheese and sprinkle sliced olives over top of each. Continue layering,  ending with meat sauce and jack cheese. You will have 2 stacks of 4  tortillas each. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 30 minutes. Let stand  for few minutes, then slice into pie-shaped wedges and serve immediately.    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #136    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
