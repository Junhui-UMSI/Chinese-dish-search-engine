"Easy Cure" Meat Jerky
Sugar, Water, Meat; any cut, Non-iodized salt, 
Trim all fat from meat. Slice meat with the grain as thin as possible. The  meat slices nicely when semi-frozen, or your butcher will do the slicing  for you. Place the meat in cool brine and refrigerate overnight.    After no less than 12 hours, take the meat from the brine, rinse lightly  and allow to dry on paper towels for 1 hour.    Place meat strips on the smoker racks and dry for 12 hours, using your  favorite fuel. When strips are the dryness you like, allow to cool and  transfer into a ziplock bag for taking on trips, hiking, camping, etc.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Christopher E.
