Take pieces and roll into a rope about 1/3 to 1/2 inch  thick.  Cut into small pieces as long as it is thick. Roll to make them  little balls. Place on a jelly roll sheet and bake in 375F oven about 10  minutes, until lightly brown.    When dough balls are ready, heat the honey, sugar, water and ginger until  it comes to a boil. Drop in the nuts and dough balls, cover, let simmer  about 10 minutes and then uncover. Let it simmer slowly; keep stirring  until all the honey is absorbed; then turn out onto a wet board. Form into  a cone, or whatever shape you wish, and let cool.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 300    From the Jewish Food recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
