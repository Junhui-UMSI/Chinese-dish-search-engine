Basic Green "Mexican Salsa"
Green Tomatillos, Salt and pepper, Fresh Green chiles serranos, Cilantro, Onion, garlic, 
Peel the green tomatillos if they still have the dry skin. In a boiling  water cook the tomatillos and chiles serranos for 1 or 2 min. Ground all  the ingredients. You can use this fresh salsa for tacos or quesadillas or  if you want you can cook it: In a sauce pan add a little amount of  vegetable oil and when it will be warm add the "salsa", cook 20 min or  more.  Now you can prepare "chilaquiles" or eggs. Patricia Wriedt.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #116      Date: Fri, 27 Sep 1996 16:03:06 -0400      From: "Garry Howard" <g.howard@ix.netcom.com>
