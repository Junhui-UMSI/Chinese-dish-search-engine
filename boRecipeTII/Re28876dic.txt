In  a shallow dish, combine 2 Tbs each oil, lime juice and soy sauce. Add beef  strips to this marinade, stir well and let stand at least 1 hour at room  temperature. To make dressing, in a blender or food processor combine 1/2  cup oil, remaining 2 Tbs lime juice, remaining 1 Tbs soy sauce, ginger,  brown sugar, garlic and jalapenos (use 3 if more hot is desired!). Process  until pureed and set aside. In a heave skillet, heat remaining 2 Tbs oil.  When oil is hot, drain beef strips (reserve marinade); add beef to skillet  and quickly stir-fry just until browned on outside. Mix reserved marinade  into dressing. To serve, place chilled greens in a large heatproof salad  bowl; top with hot beef strips. Rinse out hot skillet with dressing,  scraping down sides and bottom to get any remaining browned bits. Pour over  beef, then add cilantro, tomatoes and chopped green onions; toss. Garnish  with butterflied green onions and serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.
