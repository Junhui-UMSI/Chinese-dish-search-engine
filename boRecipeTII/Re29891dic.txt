Slice ginger root (thin), maybe about 1/3 as much as the other 2, and put  in while heating up (saves time), stir lots an lots while heating,  otherwise will burn, put optional papaya in (no matter if ripe, is ok; if  you buy cheap meat the papaya may not be optional, papaya contains the  stuff that meat tenderizer is made from) when boils and sugar is dissolved  turn off, let cool down some and put in beef. Let beef soak over night (or  how long you want). You can barbeque this or bake or panfry. Can also make  with chicken and I have sometimes only left it to soak for about 1/2 hour.    Note: You make Teri-Chicken the same way using chicken pieces, thighs are  best.    EAT-L Digest 27 June 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
