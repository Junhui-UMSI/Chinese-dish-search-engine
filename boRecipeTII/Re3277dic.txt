IN A MEDIUM-SIZE, NON-REACTIVE saucepan, combine the 1 1/2 cups sugar, the  split vanilla bean, lemon zest, lemon juice and 4 cups water. Bring to a  boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved  and the syrup is clear. Peel the pears, cut in half lengthwise, seed, core  and stem. Shape 1/2 of 1 pear into a peach-like round by cutting off the  stem end. Poach the pear halves in the sugar syrup until tender. Drain on a  rack. Preheat oven to 350F. On a baking sheet, toast the almonds to golden  brown, cool and pulverize in a food processor. Heat the milk with the  remaining 2-inch piece of vanilla bean. Meanwhile, beat the eggs, yolks and  3/4 cup sugar until thick and lemon colored, then add the flour. When the  flour is absorbed, add the milk, return to the heat, stirring, and cook 3-5  minutes, or until nicely thickened. Pour pastry cream into a bowl and stir  in the 6 tablespoons of butter. Add the almond powder, macaroons, and 1/2  cup kirsch. Allow to cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally; cover  with plastic wrap and refrigerate to chill. Heat the apricot jam, then rub  through a fine sieve and add the 1/4 cup kirsch. Heat again and stir  constantly until clear. Spread a thin layer of apricot glaze on bottom of  the baked and cooled pastry shell. Spoon in the frangipane (almond pastry  cream) and smooth it out. Set the pear round in the center and arrange  around it the pear halves, stem end facing center. Press pears gently into  the frangipane. Brush the apricot glaze over the pears; mix the pistachios  and sprinkle over the pears. Refrigerate until 15 minutes before serving.  (Can be made 1 day in advance.)
