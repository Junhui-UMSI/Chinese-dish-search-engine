And I also poach it, borrowing this liquid  from julia child:    simmer the above together for 3 minutes. (I dont have a poaching pan, and  usually use a 12" non-stick.)  Add the salmon (Ill use about a pound and a  quarter of fillets for four people), and add additional water if needed to  just cover the salmon.  Simmer this very gently until fish is cooked  throughly.  (Theres a change in color and texture; about 18 to 25 minutes  depending on the thickness of the fillets.)  Turn off the heat and let the  fish remain in the pan for 10 minutes, covered, to absorb the flavors of  the broth.    The fish is completed, but , if you wish, you can remove it, and keep it  warm.  Reduce the poaching liquid to make a delicious sauce to accompany  the fish.    Thats Julias low fat version.  Indulgences include adding one stick of  butter to the reduced poaching liquid, beating it in piece by piece; *or*  adding one cup of heavy whipping cream to the poaching liquid and reducing  it a second time. Unfortunately, both forms of the "indulgence" are very  good!    This is also her basic poaching liquid for scallops.    Digest eat-lf.v096.n083    From the EAT-LF recipe list.
