Baked Beans
Brown mustard, Dash of hickory smoke, Can baked beans, Brown sugar, Ketchup, Dash of worchesteshire, 
salt, pepper, garlic powder and thyme to taste. Bake in the oven for one  hour (about 400 degrees) I hate "baked beans" that are made on the stove  top.    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.
