Zucchini and Feta Gratin
Salt, Ground nutmeg, Eggs, Cooking spray, Pepper, Dried mint flakes, Feta cheese; crumbled*, Zucchini; sliced, Long grain rice; cooked, 
1. Preheat oven to 375    2. Combine cooked rice and 1/2 cup of the Feta    Notes: I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. Will make again.  Made a few changes from the original recipes as follows: * I used low fat  feta cheese instead of the regular to reduce the fat content even more.  Instead of Mint and Nutmeg I used Hot Sauce (quite a few dashes) and a few  red pepper flakes. Sprinkled a little paprika on top, but will use my  Blackening spice blend next time.
