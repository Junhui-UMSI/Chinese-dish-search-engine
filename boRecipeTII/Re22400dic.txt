Turnip-Water Kimchi (Korean Dong Chimi)
Chinese turnip, Fresh ginger, Scallion, Garlic, Water, Salt, Sugar, 
1.  Slice the turnip into finger-shaped pieces, 1 1/2 inches long and 1/2  inch wide. Cut the scallion into 1 1/2-inch lengths, then slice fine  lengthwise. Repeat the same process for the ginger and garlic. Place these  ingredients in a bowl, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the salt, mix well and  leave, covered, overnight.    2.  Mix 2 cups water with 1 tablespoon of the salt and the sugar in a  separate bowl.  Let this mixture stand overnight, then pour it over the  kimchi. Keep at room temperature for 24 hours. Transfer to jars and  refrigerate. It will keep for at least 1 week.    From: The Korean Cookbook, By Judy Hyun.
