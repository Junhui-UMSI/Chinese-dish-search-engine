Syds Turkey Gravy
Turkey giblets, Cold water, Salt, Turkey drippings, Flour, 
Assuming you are going to roast a turkey in the oven, it will be in a  roasting pan of some kind.  I am also assuming this turkey had giblets (you  know, liver, heart, gizzard and neck). While the turkey is roasting, put  the giblets in a pretty large pot with lots of water and a little salt.  Bring them to a boil and let em simmer. No length of time - just till they  are done.    After you remove the turkey from the roaster, there should be lots of  juices in there that have accumulated during roasting.   I pour them out into something and skim the fat off (or use one of those  fat skimming cups or brushes). Then, put the de-fatted drippings back into  the pan. Add some of the liquid from cooking the giblets if needed to make  2 c.  Whisk flour into it, and simmer while it thickens.    Scrape up all of the "goodies" from the bottom of the pan to make the gravy  extra-flavorful. If it gets too thick, you can add more liquid. If it isn't  thick enough, add more flour and continue to whisk it, to keep out most of  the lumps. You can chop up the giblets, finely and add them to the gravy as  it is almost done - just to heat them through.    If you have to add something because the color is not what you would like,  a dash of Kitchen Bouquet will do it - not much.
