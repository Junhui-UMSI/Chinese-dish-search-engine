Cinnamon, Pecans, Baking apples, Salt, Sugar, All-purpose flour, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Baking soda, Butter, Eggs, 
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla with electric  mixer. Combine dry ingredients and add to butter mixture. Mix until flour  is moistened. Fold in apples and nuts. Spread in a greased 9 x 9 inch  baking pan and bake in 350 degree oven 45 minutes or until done. Serve warm  with frozen vanilla yogurt or drizzle with vanilla glaze using 1/2 cup  powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon hot water and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.    (I always thought Brownies had to have chocolate or cocoa in them? But the  recipe doesnt call for either, and they =are= called Brownies?)
