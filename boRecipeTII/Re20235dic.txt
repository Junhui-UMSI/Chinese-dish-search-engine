Flatten the cutlets between two pieces of plastic wrap. In a heavy skillet,  cook 1/2 cup of the onion and mushrooms in 6 Tbsp butter over moderate  heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is golden. Stir in bread  crumbs, basil, salt and pepper to taste.  Let the filling cool. Divide the  filling among the cutlets and fold in the long sides of each cutlet  1/2-inch. Roll up the cutlets and tie them at each end. In a large heavy  skillet, heat 2 Tbsp butter over mod-high heat. Brown the veal birds,  patted dry, and transfer them to a bowl as they are browned. In the  skillet, cook the remaining onions in 1 Tbsp butter over moderate heat,  stirring, until golden.  Stir in stock, tomato puree, and the paprika. Add  the veal birds and any accumulation of juices. Simmer the mixture, covered,  for 15-20 minutes or until the veal is tender. Arrange the noodles on a  platter, remove strings from the veal, and transfer the veal birds to the  platter. Whisk the sour cream with salt and pepper to taste into the  skillet contents. Cook sauce until it is hot, stirring occasionally. Do not  let it boil. Serve alongside the meat and noodles in a boat. a 1959 Gourmet  Mag. favorite
