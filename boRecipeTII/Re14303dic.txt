Serve in any of the following ways:       Garnish with smoked ham, slivered; and scallions and Chinese parsley,  minced.       Rub a few drops of sesame oil on the chicken skin; serve a soy sauce dip  on the side.       Sprinkle 1 or 2 tablespoons soy or oyster sauce over the chicken, or use  in larger quantities as a dip.       Sprinkle a mixture of 3 tablespoons honey, 1-1/2 tablespoons oyster  sauce and 1/2 teaspoon salt over chicken; garnish with 2 slices fresh  ginger root and 2 scallions, minced.
