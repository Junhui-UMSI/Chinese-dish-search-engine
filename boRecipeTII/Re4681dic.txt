Cook the tripe the day before using. Wash thoroughly, place in kettle and  cover with water. Boil 8 hours. Remove the tripe. When cooled, cut into  pieces about 1/2 inch square. The next day wash the veal knuckle, cover  with 3 quarts of cold water and simmer about 3 hours, removing scum as it  rises. Remove meat from bones and cut into small pieces. Strain the broth  and return to kettle. Add the bay leaf and onion and simmer about 1 hour.  Then add the potatoes, which have been cut in squares, and the pot herbs.  Add the meat and tripe and season with salt and cayenne pepper (if  desired). Make dumplings by combining the finely chopped suet, flour, salt  and enough water to permit rolling the dough into dumplings, about the size  of marbles. Flour well to prevent sticking and drop into the hot soup. Cook  10 minutes, add some chopped parsley and serve at once.
