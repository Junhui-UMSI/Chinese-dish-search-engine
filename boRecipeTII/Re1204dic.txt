Crock Pot Apple-Cranberry Sauce
dried Cranberries, apples, cranberry juice, Lemon, juiced, Sugar, 
Wash the apples and chop them up without peeling. (What about the seeds?)  Squeeze lemon juice over them as you cut them.      Put apples in crockpot with cranberry juice -- use 1 cup if you want the  applesauce thick, more if you want it thin. Stir in sugar to suit your  taste.      Let apples stew on low for 6-8 hours.  About an hour or two before  serving, stir in cranberries or craisins. (If you use craisins, use less  sugar.)      The applesauce is a very pretty pink and the cranberries & juice give it  a nice zing.      As you can see, the recipe is simple and forgiving -- let the apples stew  a little longer or a little less - the longer you stew them the mushier the  applesauce will be. It warms up nicely, or you can eat it cold.    (Sounds like it would have to be put through a Foley food mill, to get rid  of seeds and skin.)
