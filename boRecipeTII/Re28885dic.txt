Thai Iced Tea #3
Milk, Boiling water, Thai tea, Sugar, 
1. Place tea in a coffee filter in a drip cone. Preheat carafe with boiling  water; discard water. Pour 6 ounces boiling water per serving into cone and  let it drip through. Transfer brew to another container, then pour back  through filter. Repeat until tea is deep red in color, a total of 4 to 6  times.    2. Sweeten tea to taste with sugar or condensed milk. Fill tall glasses  with ice cubes and add tea to fill glasses halfway. Add milk or  half-and-half and stir.     Variation: The tea may be brewed in a teapot, but it will still need to be  filtered through a paper filter or a very fine nylon strainer. Preheat pot  with boiling water and allow to steep 6 to 8 minutes before straining.
