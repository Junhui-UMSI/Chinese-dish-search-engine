Ready Roux
Pods garlic; minced, Bell pepper; chopped, Cooking oil, Stalk celery; chopped, Onion, Water, All-purpose flour, 
Heat oil to simmer temperature. Slowly add flour, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat & stir until mixture is golden brown. Remove from heat & add  bell pepper, onion, garlic & celery. Return to heat & stir until vegetables  are transparent. Let cool. Put into tightly closed container & store in  refrigerator. Roux will keep indefinitely to be used as a base for gumbos  or dark gravies. Add 2 quarts water when ready to use. This makes enough  base for gumbo to serve 8 to 10.    MRS.
