Ive been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks I  should "go public" with this recipe! Its for a bread machine, but you  could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my Zojirushi machine  the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so other machines may need a  light crust setting. Enjoy! Place ingred. in B/M in order given (start at  bottom for>>>> Welbilt/Dak) set crust to light and bake on white bread  setting. Im munching on the "heel" as I type and am thinking about how  good a sandwich will be in a few hours! Maybe next time Ill add pepperoni  and have all the sandwich ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza  taste! LINDA IN BIRMINGHAM 08/15 10:15 am    Re-Formatted by Elaine Radis; 3/92  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #410 by serge.cyr@sympatico.ca (Serge  Cyr) on Nov 23, 1997
