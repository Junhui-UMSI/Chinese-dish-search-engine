William Rufus(1087-1100) Place the meat in a large saucepan and cover with  hot stock made from the bones of the deer or with hot salted water, using 1  level teaspoon salt to 500 ml (2 pints) water. Bring quickly to the boil to  seal the meat, skim, and add the vegetables. Lower the heat and simmer  until tender. (About: 2-3 hours, depending on the size of the joint.)  Drain, leave in a warm oven for 5-10 minutes to dry off, then slice the  meat. Serve with frunienty and a little of the strained cooking liquid. If  you prefer roasted verison cook 1.35-1.8 kg (3-4 lb) haunch or saddle of  venison in a medum oven 180 C (350 F)Gas 4 for 20 minutes per 450 g (1 lb),  bastin frequently with melted butter.    FOR THE FRUMENTY:- Soak. the wheat for 12 hours, or overnight, in water,  preferably plac- ing the bowl in a warm place. Drain. Boil the wheat gently  in the milk for 20 minutes, add the dried fruit and continue boiling gently  for another 40 minutes. Beat the egg yolk with the honey and cinnamon anci  stir into the wheat and milk. Add a little extra milk if the mixture  appears too stiff, but dont letit get runny. The grains of wheat should be  soft. Season very sparingly with salt. If you make the frumenty in advance  add extra milk: when reheated.
