Kisses
Egg white (4 medium), Sugar, Salt, Vanilla, Coconut (or two cups macaroons), 
Heat oven to 325 degrees (slow mod).   Beat egg white until frothy.   Gradually beat in sugar. Continue beating with rotary beater or mixer until very stiff and glossy.   Stir in salt, vanilla, and coconut.   Drop heaping teaspoonfuls of dough 2" apart on ungreased brown wrapping paper on baking sheet.  Bake about 20 min., or until set and delicately browned.   Remove paper with baked kisses; lay wet towel on hot baking sheet.   Place paper of kisses on towel; let stand 1 min. Steam will loosen kisses. Slip off with spatula. Makes about 3 doz. cookies.   For chocolate-coconut kisses add 2 sq unsweetened chocolate (2 oz.) melted and slightly cooled, into batter.      Betty Crockers Cook Book, copyright 1963 by General Mills, Inc. First  Edition First Printing  I had forgotten the wet towel part...sorry. The actual Macaroon recipe (in this cookbook) says to "Drop level tablespoonfuls of dough on 2 greased and lightly floured baking sheets. Let stand at room temperature until cool. (This insures rounded macaroons).  Heat oven to 300 degrees (slow). Bake about 20 min., or until delicately golden on exterior but soft nad moist inside. Remove from sheets immediately."
