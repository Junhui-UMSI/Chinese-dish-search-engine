Basic Bread Machine Recipe
Malt, Water (110 - 120 deg.F), Gluten, Sugar, honey, molasses..., Yeast, Whole wheat flour, Unbleached white flour, Salt, 
put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water.  Use a  thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast will now  proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out all dry  ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be bubbling, add dry  stuff and any liquids including the water. start the machine and see how it  looks. If too dry, add until it looks right. Should be one big mass not  several. Flour: I often substitute 1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of  gluten for a cup of WW flour. For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar  (I commonly use honey, molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T  of carroway seeds or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have  also added 2 mashed bananas, then cut the water.  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #411 by serge.cyr@sympatico.ca (Serge  Cyr) on Nov 23, 1997
