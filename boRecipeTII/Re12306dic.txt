Garlic, Zucchini, Water, Ground beef, instant rice, Onion, Salt, flour tortillas, Bulk Italian sausage, Diced tomatoes, Dried basil, 
In a large skillet over medium heat, brown beef, sausage, onion and garlic;  drain. Add tomatoes, zucchini, rice water, basil and salt; cook until  zucchini and rice are tender about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, form eight 3-inch  balls from aluminum foil; place on a baking sheet. Drape a flour tortilla  over the top of each ball; secure sides with toothpicks to form a shell.  Bake at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until firm. Remove the toothpicks;  place shells on plates. Fill with zucchini mixture; serve warm. Zucchini  mixture can also be served as a dip with tortilla chips.    NOTES : "This savory snack served in homemade tortilla cups or with chips  is fun and filling, reports Mary Livengood of Indianapolis, Indiana."
