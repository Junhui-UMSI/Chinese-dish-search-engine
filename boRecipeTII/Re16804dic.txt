Marinade:    The night before you plan on slow cooking your dinner, mix together the  marinade ingredients in a large, closable container large enough to also  hold the chicken pieces. When marinade is thoroughly mixed, add the  chicken, close container and refrigerate until morning.    In the morning place the chicken in the slow cooker and add marinade up to  about an inch from the top of the container. Set the cooker on low and  cover.    6 to 8 hours later, turn the cooker to high.  About an hour later, saute  the sliced mushrooms in the margarine or butter. Then add the mushrooms  (with pan juices), mandarin sections, green pepper and ginger into the slow  cooker and stir thoroughly. Mix together the cornstarch, milk and cold  water, then gradually add into the slow cooker while stirring until the  entire mixture thickens a bit.    Re-cover the slow cooker and let simmer for 15 to 30 minutes until serving.  Serve with baby carrots and small new potatoes.
