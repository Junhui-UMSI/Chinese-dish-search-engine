Poppy Seed Bread (Cake)
Vanilla extract, Powdered sugar (sifted), Almond flavoring, milk, Flour, Cooking oil, Almond extract, Nutmeg, Salt, Poppy seeds, Vanilla extract, Sugar, Eggs, GLAZE, Butter flavoring, Orange juice, Baking Powder, 
Blend all cake ingredients together with a mixer. Pour into greased loaf 9  x 5 x 3 inch loaf pans.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Yield: 2 loaves  GLAZE: Mix all glaze ingredients together. Pour over bread when it is done.  NOTE: I use orange/pineapple juice instead of plain orange juice. Ive had  it made either way and like both versions equally. I just happen to buy the  juice blend regularly and seldom buy plain orange juice. (Nancy) TO BAKE IN  JARS: Grease 5 wide-mouth pint canning jars. Divide dough evenly between  jars. (Jars will be slightly over 1/2 full.) Bake at 325 degrees for 50  minutes.  Pull jars out of oven 1 at a time. Pour glaze over hot bread.  Immediately apply and firmly tighten a two-piece wide-mouth canning lid.  The lid will form a vacuum seal as the jar cools. Jars of canned bread may  be stored on the pantry shelf with other canned foods or may be placed in a  freezer.  The bread is safe to eat as long as jars remain vacuum sealed and  free of mold growth. (Nancy)
