Chicken with Barley and Quinoa Stew
Salt, Tomatoes, Skinless Boneless Chicken, Water, Barley, Quinoa, 
In crockpot put chicken breast halves, 2 C water, pearled barley, quinoa  (you need to rinse the quinoa very well before adding it to the crockpot),  chopped tomatoes with juice.    Set to HIGH for 2 hrs (check during this time to make sure that the liquid  doesnt cool out)    After 2 hrs stir and change the setting to low for 3 hrs and add salt and        1 c  water.    This should look like a stew when it is completed. It tastes wonderful.
