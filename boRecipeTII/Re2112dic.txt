Prep Time: 10 minutes (30 minutes if making dough by hand) Resting Time: 1 hour Baking Time: 20 minutes Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes Oven Temp: 400F / 200C / Gas Mark 6  1. DOUGH: Put the dry ingredients and butter into a processor and pulse 3 or 4 times.  Mix the egg & the sour cream and add to the bowl, letting the machine run  until the dough forms a ball around the blade. Remove and knead the dough  on a floured board until smooth, then chill for about an hour.   2. When the dough is cold, roll out to 1/4" thickness (or a bit  thinner if you can). Cut into 3" rounds.  Also - preheat oven at this point.  3. Place one piece of apple and some  of the other filling ingredients onto the center of the dough, brush the outer edge of the dough with some water, fold the dough over the filling and, using the very tip of the tines of a fork, press down along the edge  of the dough to seal the edges together.   OPTIONAL: If you want a shiny finish on the  pierogies, give them an egg wash, made with 1 well beaten egg and 1 tablespoon  milk.   4. Place pierogies on a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden  brown. Remove from tray and serve.   These are very good served with very  lightly whipped cream or even a Creme Anglaise.  Notes from original post: put a dot of butter and a couple  grains tapioca (just like making apple pie) so the collected juices in the  apple will thicken rather than leak out of the pierogie!!!
