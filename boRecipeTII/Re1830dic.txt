Chicken Quesadillas
Flour tortillas; 98% fat, Shredded cheddar cheese;, Cooked chicken breast halves, Chipotle hot sauce, 
Heat a griddle or a large frying pan; if you are using a frying pan, brush  the surface with olive oil. Warm the tortillas, 1 at a time, on both sides.  Return 1 tortilla to the pan, spread a quarter of the cheese over it, and  scatter a quarter of the chicken over the cheese. Add a dash of hot sauce,  and top with another tortilla. Cook until the cheese is nearly completely  melted, about 4 minutes, turn, and cook for 2 minutes more. Transfer to a  work surface, and cook the remaining quesadillas in the same manner. Cut  each quesadilla into 6 triangles, transfer them to individual plates and  serve.
