Very, Very Good Chili
***  NON   NE *****, 
In a large, heavy skillet or Dutch oven filmed with oil or bacon drippings,  fry 2 pounds of coarse-ground beef (or half beef, half pork) and one large  chopped onion over medium-high heat, stirring to break up clumps, until  nicely browned; drain off most of the fat. Add a full recipie of Adobo de  Chili Ancho, stir for several minutes to temper the raw flavor, then stir  in enough water or beef broth so that everythings floating freely.  Partially cover and simmer gently for an hour, until it looks like chili;  season with salt and a touch of sugar. If you like a less intense flavor,  add 1 cup of so of blended canned tomato along with the water, and, if you  prefer your chili with thickened juices, mix together a little masa harina  and water, and whisk it into the chili during the last few minutes of  simmering. I like my chili with whole boiled beans stirred in at the end    Recipe by: Simple Ideas from my American Home    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #914 by "Karrie Brothers"  <K_Brothers@classic.msn.com> on Nov 18, 97
