I love this cake. However, I must admit that I dont like coconut. This  cake is still delicious, but not as festive, if you omit the coconut.  Preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour the bottoms of 2 9-inch round cake  pans. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the chocolate and hot  water and cook until chocolate is smooth, stirring constantly. Set aside to  cool. In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, butter and  milk. Blend on low speed to moisten, then on medium speed, scraping bowl as  needed. Add eggs, chocolate mixture and vanilla. Blend on medium speed for  1 minute. Stir in the pecans and coconut. Pour batter into prepared pans.  Bake for 25-30 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out  clean. Remove from oven and cool on racks for about 10 minutes. Loosen the  sides with a knife and remove cake from pans, returning to racks until  completely cool. Frost.    WHITE CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine the chocolate and flour in a medium  saucepan. Blend in the milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,  until very thick. Remove from heat and cool. In a large bowl, cream the  butter, sugar and vanilla. Beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Gradually add the cooled chocolate mixture, beating after each addition.  Beat on high speed until frosting is a whipped cream consistency. Frost  cake. Sprinkle top and sides with flaked coconut.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by BNLImp@aol.com on Feb 16, 1998
