Zeytinyagli Pirasa (Braised Leeks with Rice)
Sugar, Salt, Lemons, olive oil, Onion, Water, Leeks, Rice, long-grain, uncooked, Flour, 
With a sharp knife, cut the roots from the leeks.  Strip away any  withered leaves and cut off and discard all but about 2 inches of the green  tops.  Then wash the leeks under cold running water, spreading the leaves  apart to rid them of sand.  Slice the leeks crosswise into        1    inch lengths, and set aside.    In a heavy 3 to 4 quart casserole, heat the oil over moderate heat until  a light haze forms above it.  Add the onions and, stirring frequently, cook  for 5 minutes, or until they are limp and transparent but not brown. Stir  in the flour, salt and sugar, cook for a minute or so, then add the water  and raise to a boil and thickens lightly.    Add the rice and the leeks, turning them about with the spoon to coat  them evenly with the sauce.  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly and  simmer for 30 minutes, or until the leeks and rice are tender but still  intact.  Taste for seasoning.  Cool to room temperature and serve directly  form the casserole, accompanied by the lemon wedges.
