Put the bird into a pan, add the flavourings and enough hot (not boiling)  water to cover the thighs. Poach for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours until tender. Let  the bird cool in the pan, then skin and bone it. Wrap the flesh to keep it  succulent.  Return the chicken skin and bones to the pan and simmer for 2  hours more. Strain and de-grease. Reduce to 3/4 pints and cool.    Scald or lightly toast the nuts and rub off the papery thin skins. Then,  using a spice or coffee mill, reduce the nuts and coriander seeds to a fine  powder. Process in small batches, adding the bread to minumise stickiness.  Transfer the aromatic powder to a bowl and gradually blend in as much of  the stock as is needed to make a creamy-textured masking sauce ~ you  probably wont need it at all.    Cut the meat into small strips.  Put them into a pretty dish, adding some  of the sauce and a little fresh chopped coriander between layers. Spoon the  rest of the sauce over the top to cover the meat completely. Just before  serving, stir ther walnut oil into the paprika. Drizzle the mixture over  the dish in a decorative red pattern and place a little bouquet of fresh  coriander in the centre.  Serve with rice and a green salad.
