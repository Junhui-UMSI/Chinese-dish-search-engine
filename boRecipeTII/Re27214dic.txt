Tipsy Bread and Butter Pudding
Rum, milk, Vanilla extract, Sugar, Unsalted butter, Dry crusty loaf, Eggs, Raisins, 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.    To give a different texture to bread and butter pudding, tear the bread  into 1-inch chunks, rather than slicing it with a knife. Put the chunks in  a large bowl with the raisins and pour over the rum or whiskey and about  two-thirds of the milk. Use your hand to squeeze the chunks of bread until  they have fully absorbed the liquid, then let them soak. Butter a 1 1/2  quart baking dish.    Whisk the eggs in a large bowl with the sugar and vanilla just until  smooth. Whisk in the remaining milk. Pour this custard over the bread and  stir gently.    Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it to a fairly  even layer -- it should be 1 1/2- inches deep so the pudding has a crispy  top and soft center when it is baked. Make sure there are not too many  raisins on top as they tend to dry out during baking.    Bake the pudding in the preheated oven until the custard is set and the top  of the pudding is crisp and brown, 50 to 60 minutes. A skewer inserted into  the center of the pudding should come out clean and be hot to the touch.  Serve it very warm but not scalding hot, plain or with ice cream.    Yield: 4 to 6 servings    NOTES : Recipe courtesy of Anne Willan, "In And Out Of The Kitchen"    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9060    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Feb 7, 1998
