Almond Joy Candy Bars
Sweetened condensed milk, Powdered sugar, Almonds, Vanilla extract, almonds, Milk chocolate chips, Coconut, 
Blend the condensed milk and vanilla.  Add the powdered sugar to the  above mixture a little at a time, stirring until smooth. Stir in the  coconut.  The mixture should be firm. Pat the mixture firmly into a greased  9x13x2-inch pan.  Chill in the refrigerator until firm.     In a double boiler over hot, not boiling water, melt the chocolate,  stirring often.  You may also use a microwave.     Remove the coconut mixture from the refrigerator and cut it into  1x2-inch bars.  Put 2 whole almonds atop each bar. Set each coconut bar  onto a fork and dip it into the chocolate. Tap the fork against the side of  the pan or bowl to remove any excess chocolate. Air dry at room temperature  on waxed paper for several hours. You may speed up the process by putting  in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
