1.  Preheat oven to 375 F.    2.  Place the florets in a large pan and just barely cover with water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook until two-thirds done. Strain, saving  both the liquid and the cauliflower in a small casserole dish.    3.  Heat the butter in a saucepan.  When bubbling, add the flour and cook,  stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly add the cauliflower liquid and  stir until slightly thickened.  Season with salt, white pepper, Parmesan  and paprika. Pour over the cauliflower in the casserole.    4.  Bake in preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with the bread  crumbs and almonds and serve immediately. Note: This dish can be prepared  in advance through step 2.  Bring it to room temperature if refrigerated  and bake in preheated 400 F oven 10 to 15 minutes.
