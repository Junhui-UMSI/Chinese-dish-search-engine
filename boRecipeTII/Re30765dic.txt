Day before serving, marinate chicken. Prepare marinade: In food processor  fitted with chopping blade, puree yogrut, garlic, gingerroot, paprika,  coriander, cumin, pepper, and salt until smooth. In large bowl or sealable  plastic food-storage bag, combine chicken and marinade. Cover bowl or seal  food-storage bag and refrigerate chicken to marinate overnight.    Next day, heat oven to 500F. Place chicken in large roasting pan. Brush  chicken entirely with marinade left in bowl or food-storage bag. Bake 15  minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350?and continue baking 30 to 35  minutes or until juices run clear when chcken is pierced with fork.    Meanwhile, prepare Cucumber-Yogurt Sauce; In medium-size bowl, combine  yogurt, cucumber, lime juice, mint, sugar and salt. Transfer sauce to  serving bowl cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.    Transfer chicken to serving platter. Garnish with wedges of lime and mint  leaves, if desired. Serve Cucumber-Yogurt Sauce on the side.    NOTES : Lengthy marinating in fragrant spices and yogurt serves to  tenderize the chicken and intensify the pungent flavor of the spices.
