NOTE: I just bought Donna Germans book THE BEST PIZZA IS MADE AT HOME and  discovered her "secret" for Sicilian pizza dough. Evidently the difference  in deep dish pizzas like the Sicilians is that they contain some sugar and  a higher proportion of oil. Donnas recipe for the dough is simple.I made  this for supper and did the dough in my bread machine on the "dough" cycle.  It was made in my largest old iron skillet which Id sprayed with olive oil  Pam. After I took it from the ABM, I made the dough into a circle by trying  to imitate those expert pizza chefs who fling the dough around. Mine didnt  get flung too high but it worked! I spread it in the skillet and brought up  the extra dough to form a lip around the edge, then put the pan to rise for  30 minutes while preheating the oven to 475F. Bake the crust for 5 minutes  by itself--but before you do that, prick it well with a fork all over.  Before you add toppings, drizzle olive oil on the crust and spread it  around with a brush. Toppings are up to you--but I used (in this order) 1  cup mozzarella/cheddar cheese(grated), 2 cloves garlic (crushed), 1 cup  slightly cooked fresh broccoli florets, a large sliced tomato, shredded  fresh basil and feta cheese to top. It was VERY good! This makes a thick  crust but its so good there was none left to give to the birds! I hope  Maria who first requested a Sicilian dough finds this--because Id like to  be able to share more of the goodies from this book with her! There are  thin pizza doughs as well--and all kinds of toppings. The comments above  were those of my friend Linda Calwell on Proidgy.
