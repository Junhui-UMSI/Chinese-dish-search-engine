Tzatziki (Cucumber Yogurt Dip)
plain yogurt, White vinegar, Salt and white pepper, garlic, olive oil, 
Line sieve or strainer with coffee filter or double thickness of cheescloth  and place over bowl. Spoon in yogurt, cover and let drain in refrigerator  overnight. Peel, seed and grate or finely chop cucumber. Squeeze out excess  moisture. Combine drained yogurt, cucumber, garlic, oil and vinegar. Add  salt and pepper to taste. Refigerate at least an hour to allow flavours to  blend. (I always make a day ahead). Makes about 2 cups - its addictive!!  Serve with pita bread or crackers.
