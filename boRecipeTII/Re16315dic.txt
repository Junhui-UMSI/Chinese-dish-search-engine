Heat a large pot of boiling water; drop rind in and boil  for 5 minutes.  Drain and cool.    Dissolve slaked lime in 2 quarts cold water.  Pour over rind; let stand for  4 hours.  Drain and rinse thoroughly.  Cover rind with cold water and bring  to boil; boil till rind is tender and drain.    Combine 4 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups vinegar and 8 cups water.  Add allspice,  cloves, cinnamon and ginger root (all tied in a cheesecloth bag). Bring to  boil; boil for 5 minutes.  Add rind and return to boil.  Lower heat and  simmer for 30 minutes. Leave rind standing in syrup in cool place between       12    and 24 hours.    Add 6 cups vinegar and 6 to 8 cups sugar (to taste); bring to boil. Reduce  heat and simmer until rind is transparent and syrup is almost as thick as  honey.  If syrup gets too thick before rind becomes transparent, add 1/2  cup hot water, a little at a time, as needed.    Discard bag.  Pack boiling rind and syrup into hot jars and seal.  Store at  least a month before serving.    EAT-L Digest 11 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
