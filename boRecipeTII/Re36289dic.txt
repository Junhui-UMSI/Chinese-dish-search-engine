COAT BEEF THOROUGHLY. Marinate 10 minutes. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons peanut  oil in a wok over a high flame and stir-fry the beef long enough to brown  it lightly. Remove from wok and drain. In the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons  of oil, stir-fry the asparagus for a few seconds to coat it. Add salt and  chicken broth and boil until the asparagus is tender-crisp (about 1  minute). Add the beef and toss it with the asparagus to combine them. Serve  the beef immediately.    JEAN ANDERSON    PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
