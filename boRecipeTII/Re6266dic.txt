Traditionally the fish is wrapped in banana leaves, and then the bundle is  placed in the embers of a charcoal brazier and allowed to cook slowly. (For  example if you have prepared some other dishes, then without adding extra  charcoal, you place the bundle on the embers, cover with ash, and simply  leave until experience tells you its cooked.) More practically, you can  wrap it in aluminum foil and barbecue or braze it -- it wont quite have  the flavour it acquires from the charcoal smoke and the wrapping leaves  though.    Any sort of fish could be used, but I personally like it done with sea  bass; mackerel and whiting are also good.    While your grill is getting warm, prepare the stuffing for your fish: In a  food processor, mix to a coarse paste.  Rub this into the fish and pack any  that is left inside the fish; then wrap it securely, and grill/broil for  about 5-6 minutes per side.    While it is cooking, prepare the dipping sauce: This is mixed and served by  giving each diner a small bowl of sauce.    The fish is served with a simple green salad. Colonel Ian F.
