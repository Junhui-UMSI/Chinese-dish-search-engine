Picante Tequila
See instructions, 
howdy all chile aficionados. Remember that notice about the feb. 15 hotluck  chez michele in San Francisco? It actually happened and i am still here to  tell you all about it, oh, one and a half months or so after all the  fanfare.    Skewer three jalapenos alternating with two thick slices of red pepper. Put  in a jar of Dos Reales Plata (or any decent white tequila). Soak for a  minimum of 4 days, and serve with lime.
