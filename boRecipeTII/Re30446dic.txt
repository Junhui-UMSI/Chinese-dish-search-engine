Beat together sugar and shortening in large bowl until well combined. Beat  in eggs, mashed bananas and vanilla. Beat in flour mixture. Then beat in  buttermilk. Pour batter equally into two greased and floured 9-inch round  cake pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely.    Frost one cake with whipped cream frosting, and placed a single layer of  banana slices on top. Then place second cake on top, and frost entire cake.  Garnish with banana slices.    Tip: When making whipped cream frosting, I know that a lot of people dont  add sugar when whipping. From my experiences with this cake, I find that  while whipping the cream I like to add some granulated sugar to it to make  it a little more sweet-it complements the cake better. Also: make sure that  your heavy cream is cold and you whip it until good peaks form, or else it  wont frost well.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
