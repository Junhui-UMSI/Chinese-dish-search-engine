Pesto Toscano (Tuscan Pesto)
olive oil, Salt, Fresh kale, Garlic, 
Wash the kale well in cold water & pat it dry.  Cut away the ribs & stem of  the kale, leaving only the leafy greens. Combine all the ingredients in a  food processor & process to form a thick paste. Will keep in the  refrigerator for 5 or 6 days. VARIATION: For a mellower & less robust  flavour, blanch the kale in boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes. Serves 12 as  an appetizer on crostini.
