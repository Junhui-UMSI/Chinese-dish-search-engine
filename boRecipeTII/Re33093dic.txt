Basic Ff Granola
8 C oats, (approx) concentrated fruit, Juice, Cinnamon, Raisins, 
Mix it up in a large bowl, then spread into a jelly-roll type pan. Bake at  250 F until done, an hour or so, stirring occasionally. Pour the warm  granola back into the mixing bowl and gently fold in dried fruit. When  cool, store in an airtight container.    Thats the basic recipe, but its easy to modify. Here are things I  substitute or add:    honey, nutmeg, maple syrup, Smuckers syrup, amaranth seeds, oat bran, rye  flakes, craisins, dried apricots.    Here are a few baking tricks:    * Dont overcook it. Youll end up with a pan-o-pebbles. Bake only until  "al dente". * Its less messy (with all that stirring) to use a pan with  high sides. * zip lock bags make good storage containers.
