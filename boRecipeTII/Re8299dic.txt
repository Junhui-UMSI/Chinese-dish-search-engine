Potato Picatta
Potatoes; pre-cooked with, olive oil, Garlic, Salt and lots of freshly, Capers, Lemon, 
Slice pre-cooked potatoes into thin slices. Heat olive oil in non-stick  skillet. Add garlic and saute briefly. Lower heat to medium and saute  potatoes until warmed through. Add capers, squeeze lemon juice over, and  add salt and pepper as desired. Toss until lemon juice is absorbed and  capers are warmed through. If you want some ``juice with this, you can  add a bit of broth. I personally like them kind of ``dry.
