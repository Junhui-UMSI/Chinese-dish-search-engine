Bacon Wrapped Sirloin Roast
Tip Sirloin Roast, Bone, Cherry Tomatoes, Bacon, Dijon mustard, Dried Thyme Leaves, Onions, 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Cut a few slits in the top of the roast  to allow the bacon drippings to penetrate. Spread the mustard evenly over  the entire roast. Sprinkle the thyme leaves over the top of the roast.  Place the roast on a roasting rack in a baking pan. Cover tightly with  bacon slices, wrapping them around the meat. Bake until a meat thermometer  registers 160 degrees (medium rare) (about 105 minutes). Juices should run  slightly pink (medium rare). Add onions about 40 minutes before the roast  is done. Remove the roast to the carving board and let rest at least 15  minutes before slicing. Slice the meat into even slices. Serve with onions,  bacon slices and a gravy made from pan gravy. NOTE: The bacon gets crispy  when cooked with the roast. Garnish with cherry tomatoes.
