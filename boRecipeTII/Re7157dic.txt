Had this at a friends - note the original recipe called for 1/8 tsp  crushed red pepper flakes - she adjusted that with jalapenos (yum) it was  delicious tossed with penne pasta    (This recipe uses Porcini mushrooms to smooth out the intense flavors)    Combine water & mushrooms in a small bowl. Let stand until porcini are  soft, about 25 minutes. Strain porcini, reserving liquid, discard sandy  residue. Coarsely chop porcini.    Drain tomatoes, reserving juice. Bring juice to boil in large saucepan. Add  onion and garlic. Reduce heat and simmer sauce until onion is tender, about  15 min. Add procini, reserved procini liquid, tomatoes, olives, and next 6  ingredients. Patrially cover pot and simmer until sauce is thickened  slightly, about 30 min. Season with salt & pepper.    Add sauce to cooked pasta. Toss to blend.    4 Servings; 331 cal; 4g total fat; 0.5g saturated fat; 5mg cholestrol  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #354 by "Rund, Sharen"  <RUNDSAB@alisa1.lockheed.com> on Jun 13, 1997
