Stuffed Cabbage with Red Pepper Vinaigrette
Day old white bread, Eggs, olive oil, Garlic, Coarse salt, milk, Onion, Cabbage, Black Pepper, Anejo cheese, 
Core the cabbage and remove tough outer leaves. Bring a large pot of water  to a boil, add the cabbage and boil until the outer leaves are just soft  and easy to pull off. Remove the cabbage from the water, leaving the  cooking liquid in the pot, and peel off about 10 outer leaves and set them  aside. Chop enough of the remaining cabbage to make 3 cups of chopped  cabbage. Heat oil in a large saucepan, add onion and saute until tender,  about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chopped cabbage, salt and pepper and  saute for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, place the  bread in a bowl and pour in the milk. When the bread has absorbed the milk,  add the eggs and Anejo cheese and mix well with your hands. Add bread  mixture to the cooled sauteed vegetables and mix well. Line a large bowl  with cheesecloth, letting the edges come up over the bowl. Line the sides  and bottom of the bowl with about 8 of the cabbage leaves. Fill the bowl  with the vegetable mixture and cover with the remaining cabbage leaves.  Bring the corners of the cheesecloth together and tie into a bundle.  Carefully lift the cabbage bundle and place in the pot with the cabbage  cooking liquid so that it is completely covered. Bring to a boil, then  lower heat and simmer for about 30 minutes. To serve, cut the cheesecloth  and invert the cabbage onto a serving platter. Drizzle with Red Pepper  Vinaigrette.
