From: Bulldogfla <Bulldogfla@aol.com>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Keep filo sheets laid out and covered with a  damp towel. In a bowl, combine the sugar, walnuts, cinnamon, and cloves.  Place 10-12 sheets of filo pastry in a 13 x 9-inch baking dish, brushing  every other sheet evenly with butter. Sprinkle 1/4 of the walnut mixture on  top. Cover with another 5 or 6 buttered sheets, and repeat, covering with  remaining buttered filo sheets. Heat remaining butter until hot and lightly  browned. Pour evenly over the baklava. Bake for 30 minutes. Reduce  temperature to 300 degrees and bake for 1 hour longer. When cooled, pour  hot syrup on top.    To make syrup, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil continue  boiling for 15 minutes, or until syrup is slightly thick. Add the honey and  bring just to a boil. Add lemon juice.
