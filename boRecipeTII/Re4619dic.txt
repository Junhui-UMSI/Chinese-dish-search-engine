The name literally means vegetables boiled in cocnut milk.    makheua phuang are very small Thai eggplants, that resemble crunchy garden  peas. If (as I expect) they are not available near you, then I suggest you  use tender garden peas, raw. If you can only get frozen peas, then drop  them in hot, not boiling water, until defrosted, then transfer to ice water  to stop the cooking and then strain thoroughly.    If swamp cabbvage is not available substitute spinach.    Thai long beans (sometimes called yard beans or yaks tails), can be  replaced with ordinary western long beans.    Green peppercorns are sold in Thailand on the stem, making them easy to  discard before serving, but I suggest that if you can only get loose  peppercorns, that you put them in a small muslin bag or spice ball    Method: In a saucepan bring the coconut milk to a gentle simmer and mix in  the sugar and soy sauce, and stir in the lime leaves. Add the shallots and  pepper, and gently simmer for 1-2 minutes until aromatic. Taste for the  balance of sugar and salt, and adjust if necesary.    Add the vegetables, and return to the boil. Simmer gently until just cooked  (If using garden peas, do not add them until the other ingredients are  almost cooked, and then serve as soon as they are warmed through).    Serve with either rice or noodles    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #171    Date: Thu, 28 Nov 1996 14:17:07 +0700    From: "Col. I.F. Khuntilanont-Philpott" <colonel@korat1.vu-korat.ac.th>
