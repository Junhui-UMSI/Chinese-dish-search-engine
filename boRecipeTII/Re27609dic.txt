The Best White Frosting
Lemon extract, Egg whites, Water, Cream of tartar, Sugar, 
This recipe uses a candy thermometer.    In a 1-quart saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, combine the sugar and  water. Place over low heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved.  Cover saucepan and bring mixture to a boil. Boil 5 minutes; this will  dissolve any crystals that have formed on sides of pan. Uncover and put  candy thermometer in place. Continue cooking without stirring until mixture  reaches 230 degrees (thread stage).   While cooking use pastry brush dipped  in water to wash down sides of pan to remove the crystals that form.  Meanwhile beat until frothy the egg whites and cream of tartar. Beat until  stiff, but not dry, peaks are formed. Continue beating egg whites while  pouring the hot syrup over them in a steady thin stream. Do not scrape  syrup from bottom and sides of pan. After all the syrup is added, continue  beating for 2-3 minutes or until frosting is very thick and forms rounded  peaks and hold its shape. Using the least possible amount of strokes, fold  in the lemon extract. Can also use other flavors instead of lemon. Enough  to frost sides and tops of three 8-inch cake layers.
