Potato and Rice Burgers
BURGERS, To 2 tsp. tamari or soy, Sauce, Plain non fat yogurt, Onion minced, Chopped parsley, Ground cumin, Crumbs, Parmesan cheese (or, Crushed red pepper, Potato, peeled and diced, Fresh Lemon Juice, Cooked brown rice, Dry whole wheat bread, Substitute), Garlic, Soy sauce, Chopped fresh parsley, 
In a bowl, combine sauce ingredients.  Place in refrigerator to chill.  Prepare grill or griddle.  Boil potato in water over medium heat until  tender, about 10 min.  Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients in a medium  bowl.  Drain potato and mash with a fork or masher.  Add potato to bowl,  mix well and form into 4 thin patties. If potato mixture is too dry to hold  together, add a little water before making patties.  Grill patties 4 to 5  min. on each side until lightly browned.  Serve on hamburger buns with  sauce and your choice of fixings.    I dont have a grill so I broiled mine instead and they turned out great!  Brown and crispy!  These have a nice taste.
