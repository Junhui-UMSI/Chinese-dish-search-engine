Peel and chop the shrimp, 1 green onion, the water chestnuts, and bamboo  shoots to the size of small beans.  Blend with the pork, whole egg, a pinch  of salt, a pinch of pepper, the sherry, and soy sauce. Place about 1  rounded tsp. of stuffing on each won ton skin. Fold the wrapper to close  tightly. Seal with the egg white. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a  boil. Add the won tons and cook until the skins are slightly  transparent--about 10 to 15 minutes. Drain. Just before serving, place the  chicken broth in a pot; add the ginger, splashes of sherry and soy sauce,  and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and add the won tons to  reheat.  Chop the remaining green onion. Serve 4 won tons per person in  bowls of broth, garnished with the chopped onion. CHICKEN BROTH: Coarsley  chop the celery, onion, parsley, and cloves. Place with the remaining  ingredients in a stock pot over high heat.  As the stock reaches the  boiling point, a grey foam will form and rise to the surface. Skim this off  with a slotted spoon; discard. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer slowly  for 2-1/2 to 3 hours without stirring.  Remove from heat and strain. Taste  for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if necessary.    ORIENT EXPRESS    KETCHUM, SUN VALLEY.    BEVERAGE:  TSINGTAO BEER    From the <Micro Cookbook Collection of Chinese Recipes>.
