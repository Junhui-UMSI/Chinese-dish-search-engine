Bacon Corn Bread
Pan-fried bacon; save the, Recipe "Corn Bread", 
SERVES 6      Bacon was one meat that would keep fairly well during the long trip on  the trail, providing you kept it in bags surrounded by bran. The bran would  help prevent the bacon fat from melting under the heat of the prairie sun.  This dish offers a new flavor, which must have been truly delicious after a  day in that wagon!      Cook the bacon until crisp. Reserve the fat. Chop the bacon and stir it  into the corn bread batter. Use bacon fat instead of shortening, if you  wish, to make the batter.      Grease the pan with a good bit of the bacon fat and bake the corn bread  as directed.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
