Turron (Spanish Nougat) Andalusia
Caster sugar, Egg white, Egg yolks, Ground almonds, 
Today these swwets can be bought all over Spain. In olden days, Turron was  a costly treat, and was made at home for special occasions such as  christmas or Easter. Each family had its own recipe.      Thoroughly mix the sugar and almonds in a bowl. Fold in the egg yolks,  one after the other. Whisk the egg white into a stiff foam and fold it into  the mixture. Lay a sheet of foil over a baking sheet and place the mixture  on it. Press the mixture into a slab about 1.5cm /1/2 inch thick using a  rolling pin and your fingers. Cover it with foil and place a wooden board  weighted down with a couple of full tin cans on top. Leave the turron to  stand for 3 days, so that it dries out and hardnes, then slice it into  2.5cm/ 1 inch squares.      Note: EggBeaters and Just Whites can be used in place of raw eggs .
