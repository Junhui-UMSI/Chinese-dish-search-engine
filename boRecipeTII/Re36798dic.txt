Ive listed 3 of my  favorites below - juices and herbs can be changed depending on whats  available. Each makes about 1 1/2 cups.    In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, wine, lemon zest and lemon juice  and bring to a boil. Stir in juice and herbs and reduce over moderate heat  to a light syrup consistency. Strain if desired and store refrigerated..    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #172    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
