Heat oil in skillet; stir-fry the beets, carrots, onions and raisins for  several minutes over medium-high heat. Add the remaining ingredients; lower  heat.  Toss well to combine.  Cover and steam until the vegetables are  tender, 15 to 20 minutes.    Horton wrote: "The flavors in this recipe are absolutely remarkable. You  may use all beets or all carrots instead, but the combination is superb and  beautiful to look at as you prepare.  If the beets are well scrubbed, they  do not have to be peeled."
