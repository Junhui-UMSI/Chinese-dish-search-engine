Tapioca is a plant product made from the roots of the cassava plant-  ~also called manioc.  Its a major product in Thailand and I saw  "tapioca trees" all over the place.  The plant itself isnt a tree,  but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set  upright in the fields so they dont rot during the rainy season.  Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks  like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be  removed by cooking.  Those little balls are actually made++like  risotto or "rice pasta".  Its usually used to make sweet puddings  here, but in the Orient its used to make thick, savory soups.  Like  this one!    Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot  stock into a bowl and stir in the pork.  Return mixture to the pan.  Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook  for 5 to 10 minutes.  When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat  and season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat.  Line  individual soup bowls with the lettuce.  Pour in the soup and  sprinkle with coriander leaves.    From "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and Tettoni, Times  Editions, Singapore.  1987.    This is a simple, excellent soup and subject to all sorts of  variations.
