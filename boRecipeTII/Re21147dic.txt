Recipe by: Los Angeles Times 12-28-97 Dissolve yeast in warm water in large  mixing bowl. Put potatoes through ricer or food mill to make 3/4 cup. Stir  1-1/2 teaspoons salt and potatoes into mixing bowl with yeast. Add 2 cups  flour and mix. Add more flour as needed to achieve soft, elastic dough.  Knead on floured board until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Put in  bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside in warm place to rise until  doubled in volume, about 1-1/2 hours. Put walnuts, mint and remaining 1/2  teaspoon salt in blender or food processor. Slowly drizzle in 1/2 cup oil  while processing. Process until walnuts are size of lentils. Set aside.  Punch down bread dough when doubled in size and place on cornmeal-covered  bread stone or parchment-paper-lined baking sheet. Rub hands with olive  oil, then spread out dough 1/2 inch thick. Make dimples in dough with  fingers. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Spread 1/4 cup  walnut pesto onto half of focaccia. (There will be about 1/2 cup pesto  left.) Sprinkle Gorgonzola cheese and freshly ground black pepper on other  half. Bake at 450 degrees until bread is puffed and browned at edges, about  15 minutes.
