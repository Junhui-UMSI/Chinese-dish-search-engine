Add water,bread  crumbs or matzo meal, eggs, onions, chopped carrots, salt and pepper and  mix well.    Spray a 12"x3"x3" or a heavy bread pan with a kosher spray. Put one half of  mixture in pan and tap down. Place cooked, mashed carrots down the middle  of mixture in a stripe.    Add rest of fish and tap down. Cover with foil and place in a water bath.  Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1 hour. Uncover pan and let cook for  another half hour or until knife comes out clean. Cool and refrigerate.    Turn over on plate. Slice and serve. I usually place the slices on a leaf  of butter lettuce or radicchio and decorate with a stem of parsley or dill.    Fortunately our local fish store will grind the fish, carrots, and onions.  Saves a lot of work.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Jerome & Jean Emer <j.emer@megsinet.net> on  Sep 18, 1998,
