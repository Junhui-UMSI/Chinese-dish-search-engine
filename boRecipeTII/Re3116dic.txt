Peanut Soup
Good stock (preferably made, milk, Shelled peanuts, 
This is from an old, old book put out for British settlers in  Nyasaland in Africa.  Not sure what that is today...  The recipe is  simple and to the point and actually looks pretty good.  I have some  other peanut soup recipes++Asian ones++that Ill be posting for you  over the weekend.    Dry peanuts in the oven until the skin can be rubbed off and the nuts  are a deep biscuit in colour.  Crush with a rolling pin, or mince, to  a very fine meal.  Strain the stock and simmer with the nut meal for  1/2 hour or more. Season to taste.  Before serving, stir in milk, or  even better, 1/2 small tin unsweetened condensed milk, add a little  butter and serve.    From "Nyasaland Cookery Book and Household Guide".  Compiled and  published by The Nyasaland Council of Women.  P.O.  Box 318, Limbe,  Nyasaland. No date given.  [But its REAL old.  S.C.]    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; January 11 1991.
