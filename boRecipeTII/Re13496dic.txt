Whole-Wheat Cloverleaf Rolls
Margarine, Sugar, water, Dry yeast, Vegetable oil, Egg, Whole-wheat flour, 1% low-fat milk, Vegetable cooking spray, All-purpose flour, Salt, 
Dissolve 1 teaspoon sugar and yeast in warm water, and let stand 5 minutes.  Place remaining sugar, 1-1/4 cups all- purpose flour, whole-wheat flour,  and salt in food processor, and pulse 2 times. With food processor on, add  yeast mixture, milk, oil, and egg through food chute; process until dough  leaves sides of bowl and forms a ball. Process an additional minute (dough  will be sticky).    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and  elastic (about 5 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a  time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands. Place dough in a large bowl  coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a  warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.  Punch dough down; cover and let rest 5 minutes.    Coat 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Divide dough into 12 equal  portions. Divide each portion into 3 pieces; shape each piece into a ball.  Dip balls in melted margarine; place 3 balls in each muffin cup. Cover and  let rise 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Uncover dough; bake at 400  degrees for 15 minutes or until browned.
