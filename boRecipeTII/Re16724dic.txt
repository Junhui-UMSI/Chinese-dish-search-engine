I recently tasted my all-grain porter against  Anchors and the big thing I notice was Anchor Porter is thick, creamy.  Mine is low carbonated, but it does not have that creamy feel. This was my  first all-grain brew  and my first porter. It has a good malt flavor. Next  time I would cut  back on the hops some.
