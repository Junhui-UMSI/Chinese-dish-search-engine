Preparing Sweetbreads
Lemons, Salt and pepper, milk, Sweetbreads, 
Soak sweetbreads in a shallow dish covered with milk. Set aside in a cool  place or refrigerate for at least 4 hours to whiten. Discard milk, place  sweetbreads in a saucepan, squeeze lemons over and drop in lemon shells as  well. Add 1 tablespoon of salt, a pinch of pepper and cover with water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Sweetbreads should  be about medium when they are done poaching. Using a slotted spoon transfer  sweetbreads to an ice water bath to cool quickly. Drain and pat dry.    To press sweetbreads, place on a large plate, top with another plate, and  weight with several cans. Set aside, refrigerated, at least 4 hours.  Sweetbreads should be pressed to 3/4-inch thickness to give them a nice,  firm texture; if you dont press them enough they will be spongy.    To clean pieces, remove any excess membranes and veins from pressed lobes;  leave pieces as intact as possible. If lobes are large, slice them in half  horizontally. Sweetbreads are ready to use in any recipe.
