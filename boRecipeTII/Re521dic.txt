1. Soften yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes. 2. Meanwhile combine  butter, sugar and salt in large bowl; pour hot water over mixture. 3. Cool  to lukewarm; stir, then blend in 1/2 cup of the flour, beating until  smooth. 4. Stir yeast; add to flour mixture, blending in thoroughly. 5. Add  about half the remaining flour and beat until very smooth. 6. Mix in  remaining flour to make a soft dough. 7. Turn dough onto lightly floured  surface; let rest 5 to 10 minutes. 8. Lightly grease deep bowl large enough  to allow dough to double. 9. Knead dough; shape into smooth ball and put in  greased bowl; turning to bring greased surface to top. 10. Cover with waxed  paper or towel; let stand in warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 1  1/2 hours. 11. Punch down; pull edges to center, then turn dough completely  over. 12. Cover; let rise again until almost doubled (about 45 minutes).  13. Meanwhile, grease baking sheet lightly; sprinkle evenly with cornmeal.  14. Punch down dough; turn out onto lightly floured surface. 15. Roll out  to 14x8-inch rectangle; roll up rectangle tightly into a long slender loaf  and pinch ends to seal. 16. Place loaf diagonally on prepared baking sheet.  17. With sharp knife, make diagonal slashes at 2-inch intervals. 18. Brush  top with part of egg white mixture; cover loosely and let rise in waram  place until doubled in bulk. 19. Brush loaf again with remaining egg wash;  bake in preheated 425F. oven 10 minutes. 20. Brush again with egg wash;  reduce temperature to 375F. and bake 20 minutes longer, or until golden  brown.    NOTE: To increase crustiness, place flat pan filled with boiling water in  bottom of oven.    Original poster not on file    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 26, 98
