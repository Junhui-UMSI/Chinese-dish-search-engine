CHEAPER AND BETTER, Avocado, AVOCADO HONEY MASK, Honey, 
Peel and slice avocade. Puree with honey. Pat it gently to the face and  continue patting until the mask feels extremely tacky to the touch. Relax  and leave the mask on 20-30 mins. Rinse with warm water. Big savings.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #196    Date: Fri, 12 Jul 1996 18:32:40 -0400    From: Dan Schamber <dansch@haven.ios.com>
