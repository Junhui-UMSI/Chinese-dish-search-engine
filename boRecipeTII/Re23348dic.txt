Tuna with Oranges and Shiitakes
Soy sauce, Chopped fresh thyme, Garlic; minced, 3/4-inch-thick tuna steak;, Navel oranges, Black Pepper, Orange-juice concentrate, Shiitake mushrooms; stems, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prepare 4 pieces of parchment paper or  aluminum foil for papillotes. Using a sharp knife, remove skin and white  pith from the oranges. Cut the segments away from their surrounding  membranes. Squeeze any remaining juice from the membranes into a small  bowl. Stir in orange-juice concentrate, thyme, soy sauce, garlic and  pepper. Place a piece of tuna on one half of each opened paper heart.  Distribute mushrooms and orange sections over the tuna. Spoon orange juice  mixture over top. Seal the packages and place them on a baking sheet. Bake  for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the packages have puffed. (You may want to  open one package to check that the tuna flesh is opaque.) Transfer the  packages to individual plates; let each diner open his or her own package.  Serves 4.
