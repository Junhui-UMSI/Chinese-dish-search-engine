* Do not use self-rising flour in this recipe.   Mix ground beef, onion, cheese, 1/4 teaspoon salt, garlic salt and egg  white; reserve. Mix flour, egg yolk, water, 1/2 teaspoon salt and paprika  until a soft dough forms. Knead on floured surface until dough is elastic,  about 2 minutes.  Divide dough in half. Roll half into 12" square about  1/16" thick; cut into 2" squares. Fill each square with scant teaspoon beef  mixture.  Moisten edges of squares; fold into triangles. Pinch edges  together.  Repeat with remaining dough. Heat oil (1") to 400-degrees in 10"  skillet.  Fry wrap-ups until golden, about 45 seconds; drain. Serve hot or  cold.
