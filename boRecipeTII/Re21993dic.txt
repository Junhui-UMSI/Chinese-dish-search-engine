Spread a generous 2 - 3 Tbsp Caesar dressing over entire surface of each  flour tortilla or lavash bread. Lay 3 romaine leaves on each tortilla,  pressing them gently into the dressing. Place turkey and roasted red  peppers equally on one half of each tortilla. Sprinkle cheese evenly over  the top of everything on tortillas.      Roll up each sandwich tightly like a jellyroll, starting with the turkey  side. Wrap individually and refrigerate for 1 hour. Before serving, cut  each wrap in halves, quarters, or 1 1/2-inch bite-size rounds.    Recipe by: The Oregonians "Food Day"  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #937 by LBotsko~~at;aol.com on Nov 30, 1997
