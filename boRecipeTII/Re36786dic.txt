Strawberry Mascarpone Fool - Gourmet
Balsamic vinegar, Heavy cream well chilled, Strawberries hulled and, Sugar, Mascarpone cheese, 
Only about 10 minutes + chopping & chilling times. Delicious summer  thing... Use crystal champagne glasses to serve.    In a bowl toss the strawberries with the sugar and the vinegar and them  then macerate at room temperature tossing them occasionally, for 1 hour.  Reserve one cup of the strawberry mixture, and in a food processor or  blender puree the remaining mixture with the Mascarpone until completely  smooth. In a chilled large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the heavy  cream until it holds stiff peaks and fold in the Mascarpone mixture gently  but thoroughly. Divide the reserved strawberry mixture among 6 stemmed  dessert glasses, spoon the cream mixture over it, and chill the desserts  for 1 hour.
