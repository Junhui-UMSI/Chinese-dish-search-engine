Salt, Vegetable stock, Young beetroot, Brown sugar, Parsley, Onions, Lemon, Yeast extract, 
Chop the onions and fry gently in a small amount of the stock but do not  brown them. Add the beetroot which you have washed and shredded. Pour in  the rest of the stock and the juice of the lemon, then the yeast extract,  sugar and salt to taste. Simmer for 40 minutes, mash slightly or blend part  of the soup and serve with fresh parsley.    Adapted from "Healthy eating for a new age" by Joyce Dsilva.
