Recipe by: Author Unknown    To make the dough: (makes one tarte about 12 - 14" in diameter):    * Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm milk and let it proof for a few    minutes. * Knead the butter to soften it. * Put the flour into a mixing  bowl and add in the salt, sugar and the    lightly beaten eggs. * Mix together and then add in the yeast and milk  mixture. Then incorporate    the butter. Knead for at least 5 minutes. * Put the dough in a large  mixing bowl, cover it and let it rise for about        2    hours. * Then punch down and mold the dough into a large tarte  pan. Cover and let    it rise one hour. * Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the top of the  dough with the egg    yolk that has been mixed with 2 drops of water. Sprinkle the top with the    crystallized sugar and bake for 30 - 35 minutes at 350 degrees F.    To make the pastry cream:    * Put the milk and the vanilla bean, which has been cut lengthwise, into an    enamel (or non-reactive metal) pan. * Bring to a slight boil and remove  from the heat to let the vanilla bean    infuse the milk. * During this infusion time, separate the eggs, keeping  the yolks. Put the    whites in a separate bowl and save for another use. In a mixer, beat the    egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy (5 min.). Add the sifted    flour, beating lightly until all the flour is incorporated. * Remove the  vanilla bean from the milk. Scrape out the seeds and put back    into the milk (to give a stronger vanilla flavor). * Add milk to the  egg/flour mixture gradually. * Cook this mixture at high heat, stirring  continuously to prevent sticking    and burning on the bottom until the mixture becomes very thick and    difficult to stir. This should take about 2 minutes. * After the pastry  cream is cooked, put it into a clean bowl. Before the    cream has cooled all the way down, add butter which has been kneaded to    soften. Beat the mixture energetically by hand or with a mixer. *  Refrigerate until ready to use.    Final assembly:    * Cut the brioche tarte in half horizontally. * Spread the pastry cream on  the bottom layer. * Arrange halved strawberries or raspberries on the cream  layer and replace    the final top layer of the brioche. * Refrigerate until served.    Note:    * Bakers crystallized sugar: This is a special kind of "puffed" sugar used    is French pastries. It looks like "rice crispies" and has about the same    light texture and crunch. Its very difficult to find this type of sugar,    but worth the effort to make your Tarte Trop?zienne look authentic. The    only luck Ive had in San Francisco is buying some from a local French    bakery.
