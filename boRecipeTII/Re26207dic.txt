Toms Death By Basil Mayonnaise
Fresh basil, Habanero peppers, Mayonnaise, Cloves (large) garlic, 
Collect the basil and wash and remove the leaves.  Allow to dry.  Measure  the basil.  1/2 cup is a 1/2 cup measurer packed with as much basil as you  can get into it.    Remove the stems and seeds from the habanero.  Be careful...    Mince the basil, habaneros and garlic in a food processor until finely  minced.    Mix with the mayonnaise (I prefer low-fat Hellmans).  Refrigerate at least  2 days for the flavors to marry. I keep it in a 1 pint canning jar.    The basil flavor is dominant with just enough heat from the peppers to let  you know they are there.  This goes great on many types of sandwiches.    The recipe was prompted by a comment from someone that basil can be used  instead of lettuce on sandwiches.  This is an easy way to accomplish this  and get a little heat at the same time. It is delicious.    Date: Tue, 13 Aug 96 11:22 EST    From: Tom Greaves <0007168628@mcimail.com>    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #072    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
