Sugar, Fresh Lemon Juice, Cinnamon, Bosc pears, Chilled whipping cream, Dry Red Wine, Orange juice, Sugar, Cognac **, 
http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/4908/pear.htm    Combine wine, orange juice, sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon stick in large,  heavy saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar  dissolves. Remove from heat.    Peel pears, leaving stems intact. Cut small slice off the bottom of each  pear so it will stand upright. Arrange pears on their sides in saucepan.  Cover and simmer until pears are tender but still hold their shape, turning  once, about 15 minutes per side. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pears to  upright position in glass baking dish.    Boil cooking liquid until reduced to approximately 1/2 cup, about 9  minutes. Watch carefully to make sure liquid is not reduced too far. Pour  into small bowl, cover and chill sauce and pears separately until cold, at  least 2 hours or up to one day.*    Beat cream in large bowl until soft peaks form. Add Cognac ** and sugar and  beat until stiff peaks form.    Transfer pears to upright position on serving plates. Spoon on red wine  sauce and top with whipped cream.    * I have served this hot before and it is quite good. ** Actually just  about any liqueur will do. I particularly like the results I have had using  Amaretto.    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Mar 24, 1998
