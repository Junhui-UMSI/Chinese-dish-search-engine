*NOTE: Original recipe used 2 large eggs    **NOTE: Original recipe used regular buttermilk    In a med mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder,  and baking soda. Sprinkle the polenta over the other dry ingredients and  toss until evenly mixed.    In a separate bowl, beat the egg and egg beaters lightly with a fork, then  add the buttermilk and the melted butter and whisk together briefly. Add  the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just blended - the  batter will be a little lumpy. Gently fold in the blueberries until they  are evenly distributed in the batter.    Heat a large skillet or a griddle until it is so hot that droplets of water  dance across the surface, then brush it with vegetable oil or spray with  nonstick spray. Using a 1/4 C measure or a 2 oz ladle, pour the batter onto  the pan or griddle and cook until large bubbles form on the top of the  pancake and the edges begin to brown. Flip to th eother side and cook for  another minute or so, until the bottom is browned. Transfer to a paper  towel-lined plate and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining  pancakes.
