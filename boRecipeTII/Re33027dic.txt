Cook stirring occasionally, for 15   minutes.  Remove  from heat and stir in vanilla.      The sauce is best when served warm.  Either serve immediately or   reheat in double boiler for 10 minutes or  microwave for 1 minute.  To   store pour into strilized glass jars.  Allow  sauce to cool before   refrigerating.  It will keep for 6 months in the  refrigerator.
