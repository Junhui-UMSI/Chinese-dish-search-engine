Alaska Smoked Salmon
Rock salt, hickory chips, light brown sugar, Salmon; fresh, 
Cut strips of salmon lengthwise, two-inches wide.  Score thickest parts.  Keep belly parts for last 20 minutes of marinating (belly section is  thinner, requiring less soaking).     Add rock salt and brown sugar in plastic bucket, filled 2/3 with water.  Stir to dissolve.     Soak all salmon pieces, except belly, in brine for one hour.  Stir  occasionally.  Add belly strips during last 20 minutes.     Remove fish strips and smoke with hickory chips for eight hours, being  sure salmon strips are placed in highest position in smoker.
