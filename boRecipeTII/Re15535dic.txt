7 Layer Dip
Lawrys taco mix, Tomatoes; chopped, Fritos jalapena bean dip, Green Onions, Cheddar cheese, Sour cream; mixed with, (small) sliced ripe olives, COMBINE, COMBINE, Lemon juice, Avocados; mashed, Garlic salt to taste, 
I suggest shredding cheese first and putting in refrigerator until needed-  easier to work with. Refrigerate, covered with Saran wrap, for 24 hrs. for  flavors to blend.    Recipe by: Liz Custer    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #999 by " Liz Custer" <custer@dconn.com> on  Jan 9, 1998
