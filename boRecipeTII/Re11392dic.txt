1. Preheat broiler.    2. Broil the peppers, turning frequently, until skin has blackened on all  sides. Remove from broiler and immediately put into a large brown-paper  bag. Seal tightly. Allow peppers to steam in the sealed bag for about 20  minutes or until cool enough to handle.    3. When peppers are cool, remove from bag. Remove the blackened skin, stems  and seeds, and cut the peppers, lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick strips.    4. Let strips stand in a colander for at least 3 hours or until most of the  moisture has drained off.    5. Combine peppers with oil, raisins, nuts, parsley, and, if using, garlic.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir. Allow to marinate for at  least 1 hour before serving at room temperature.
