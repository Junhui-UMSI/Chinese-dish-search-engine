The Butt was the best one yet. It was a little one at 7 lbs. I followed a  recipe that I found at the Top Secret Recipes sight  http://www.topsecretrecipes.com/ called The Harley Davidson Cafe Harley Hog  Sandwich. It is very good. I smoked everything using lump as the main heat  source and chunks of hickory and what I had left of a pear tree that I cut  down last year. It cooked for about eight hours and pulled just perfect.  Kinda hard to leave that $90 Henckles knife in the drawer though.    1. Combine all of the rub ingredients. Coat the pork butt evenly with  mixture, shaking off any excess.    2. Soak wood chips in water 30 minutes. Place pork butt in a smoker on rack  at 220 degrees for 8 hours, with smoke going for 2 hours. Let it cool  slightly. Break the meat apart with your hands.    3. saute onions in oil in heavy saucepan until translucent. Add the  remaining ingredients and cook until mixture is thick and coats the back of  a spoon. Puree the sauce and let it cool. (Sauce can be made 2 to 3 days in  advance and refrigerated.)    4. Combine the pork and the sauce (to taste) in a heavy saucepan. Cook  until it is heated through.    5. To serve: Pile the pork on the rolls. Serve with french fries and cole  slaw if desired.    Yields 12 servings.
