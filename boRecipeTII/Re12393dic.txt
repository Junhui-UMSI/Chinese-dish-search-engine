Zucchini-Apple Pie
Butter or margarine, Zucchini, cut lengthwise, Green baking apple, All-purpose flour, Nutmeg, Granulated sugar, Salt, Cream of tartar, 9-inch pie crusts, unbaked, Cinnamon, Lemon juice, 
Preheat oven to 375-degrees. Peel zucchini, cut lengthwise, remove seed and  cut as you would for apple pie. Cook in boiling water until BARELY tender  (about 2-3 minutes--however, I microwave for about a minute or two in a  casserole dish), but DO NOT over-cook. Drain. Cool in ice water for 5  minutes then drain again. Pare and slice apple. Mix zucchini and apple  together with rest of ingredients. Pour into prepared crust. Dot with  butter or margarine. Cover with the top crust and crimp the edges to seal.  Bake 40 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling  is bubbly.  If the crust begins to brown too quickly, cover it with pieces  of foil or take an aluminum (throw-away type), cut out the middle and place  the cut-out edge over the crust edge of the pie.
