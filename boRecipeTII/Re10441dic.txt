Quick Crab Casserole
Dry mustard, salt, Bread, Sharp Cheddar cheese, Eggs, Butter, Crab meat, milk, 
1. Line bottom of a greased 11x7" casserole dish with the bread.    2. Layer the crab on top of bread; crumble the cheese and place on top of  the crab.  Pour the melted margarine or butter over the top.    3. Beat eggs, mustard, milk and salt together.  Pour over the casserole and  cover and refrigerate overnight. This is a MUST! It needs to sit in the  fridge so the flavors can meld.    4. Bake covered in a preheated oven at 350  degrees for an hour.    NOTE: Another 50s casserole. When I started making this I would poach  halibut and use it in place of crab. SOURCE: A Jewish Mothers Cookbook;  Author, Elaine Radis; published on disk by ONE COMMAND SOFTWARE, 1995.
