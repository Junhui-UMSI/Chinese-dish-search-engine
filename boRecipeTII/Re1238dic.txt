Place in a  lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat entire surface of dough with oil. Cover  with a warm damp cloth, and a dry one on top, and leave in a warm place  until dough is doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch down the dough, turn onto lightly floured board and shape into two long,  French-style loaves.  Sit them on an ungreased baking sheet  sprinkled with cornmeal. Slash tops of loaves diagonally in two or three  places with a single-edge razor blade or very sharp knife. Brush loaves lightly with the egg white wash. Place in a COLD oven, on middle shelf. Set  temperature to 400F, and bake the bread 35 minutes, or until its well  browned and sounds hollow when tapped on top.
