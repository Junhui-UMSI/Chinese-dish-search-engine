Gradually add olive oil and process until well blended. Set aside.    In 2-quart saucepan, heat broth and wine just to boiling.  Remove from heat  In large skillet, heat oil over medium heat.  Add rice and garlic; saute,  stirring constantly, 3 minutes or until rice just starts to brown.

Continue to cook, stirring constantly and adding broth  mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, until all liquid has been absorbed and rice is  creamy but slightly al dente--about 20 to 25 minutes.
