Almond Rice Pilaf with Artichoke Hearts
Chicken Rice-a-Roni, Jar marinated artichoke, Curry powder - or more to, Mayonnaise, Green onions, Green olives, Chopped green bell pepper, 
Prepare rice-a-roni as directed on package. Add diced peppers, onions,  olives, and artichoke hearts. Stir in mayo, curry and refrigerate. Even  better the next day! I sometimes make a main dish out of this by adding  shrimp or turkey.    NOTES : From: Kathy in CA  Posted to brand-name-recipes by Meg Antczak <meginny@frontiernet.net> on  Apr 03, 1998
