Mark Haugen writes: "This makes a great summer buffet dish. Just add some  terrific corn sticks and you have a simply delicious meal."    STEP ONE: Roast all peppers and chiles over an open flame until the skin  blisters. Then place them in a covered bowl or plastic bag until the skin  begins to loosen. Peel, seed, and cut into 1/2-inch dice.    Combine diced peppers, turkey, and celery in a large bowl. Season with salt  and pepper to taste.    STEP TWO: To make dressing, please refer to the recipe "Almond-Anaheim  Dressing" in this cookbook.    STEP THREE: Toss salad with dressing and adjust seasonings to your  preference. Serve salad sprinkled with toasted almonds and garnished with  fresh fruits.
