Lasagne
Tomato Paste, (12 oz), Garlic salt, Basil Leaves, Oregano, Cottage Cheese, (1 lb), Parmesan cheese, Mozzarella Cheese, Box Lasagna Noodles, Ground beef, Whole Tomatoes, (1 lb 12 oz), 
Cook meat and drain off fat. Add tomatoes (break up with a fork), tomato  paste, garlic salt, basil, and oregano. Simmer about 20 minutes. [I  sometimes let it simmer longer.]    Stir together cottage cheese and one half of the Parmesan cheese. Cook  lasagne noodles according to the directions on the box. Shred the  mozzarella cheese.    In a 13" x 9" pan, alternate layers of the meat mixture, cottage mixture,  shredded mozzarella cheese, and the noodles, ending with the meat sauce.  Sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan cheese.    Bake at 350 degrees for one hour (or 45 minutes if it has not been  refrigerated.) Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.    NOTES : I was a Betty Crocker Home Tester for 13 years in the 60s and 70s  and this is one of the recipes they sent me to test.  Its been one of our  favorites for years.
