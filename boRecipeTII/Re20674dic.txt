Press down to even out the apples.    Prepare the topping by combining all the dry ingredients first.  Then cut  in the butter until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. (This works really  well in a food processor.) Spread the topping evenly over the apples and  press down. Bake about 1 hour in a 350 degree oven.
