SERVES 4-5      This is a recipe sent me by a viewer. It was good in her version, but we  decided to zip it up a bit with a few additions. I hope that Gertrude will  not be angry with me. This is a whole meal when served with bread and a  very crisp salad.      Place the rice in a large bowl and cover with 6 cups boiling water. Allow  to soak for 4 hours. Drain, discarding the water.      Cut the ribs into 3- to 4-rib serving pieces and place on an oven  broiling rack. Bake at 450? for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.      Mix all other ingredients, except the onion slices and the seasoning of  salt and pepper for the ribs.      Choose a large, lidded oven-proof casserole and place 1/3 of the rice on  the bottom. Top with 1/3 of the browned ribs; season the meat with salt and  pepper and top with 1/3 of the onion slices. Repeat the layer of rice,  ribs, and onions as before. Continue until you have 3 complete layers.      Pour the tomato mixture over the pan contents and cover. Bake in a 350?  oven for about 2 hours, or until the bones are loose from the meat.      You should stir this mixture twice while it is in the oven.      This is one of those "jump in" dishes, so I hesitate to add too much to  the menu. You need a salad, a lot of beer, many napkins, and certainly  people whom you like at the table. It is messy!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
