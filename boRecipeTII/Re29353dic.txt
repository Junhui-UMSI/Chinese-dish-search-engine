Brush the foil with some virgin olive oil and brush the fish with some oil  too. Season it with some salt and black pepper.  Finely chop the herbs with  the garlic to make a herb/garlic pesto and sprinkle over the trout to cover  completely.  Or, if using whole trout, stuff into the cavity.  Lay a few  thin slices of lemon over the top and wrap the foil tightly. Place in a  baking dish and bake in the oven until done...this depends on the size of  the fish so I dont know how long....it could take around 20 minutes or so  on average. When cooked, remove from the foil, remove the lemon slices and  drizzle some more olive oil over the top if you wish and serve with wedges  of lemon.
