Three Cheese Stuffed Shells
Fresh Parsley, Tomato Sauce, Dried Oregano, Pasta Shells, Grated Parmesan cheese, Fresh Parsley, Mozzarella Cheese, Egg, Italian-Style, 
Cook shells about 18 minutes or till tender but still firm. Drain well.  Cool shells in a single layer on a piece of greased foil. Meanwhile, for  filling, stir together egg, cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan  cheese, the 2 tbsp. fresh parsley, and oregano. Spoon a scant 1/4 cup  filling into each cooked shell. Arrange filled shells in a 2-quart square  baking dish. Combine undrained tomatoes and tomato sauce; pour over shells  in baking dish. Bake, covered, in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Uncover  and bake 10-15 minutes more or until heated through. Sprinkle with  additional snipped parsley.    NOTES : Use tongs to avoid tearing shells when lifting out of boiling  water.  When spooning filling, use two spoons; one to hold filling, one to  scrape into shell.
