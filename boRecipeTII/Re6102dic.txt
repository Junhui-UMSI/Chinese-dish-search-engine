Pizza Dough 2
Yeast, All-Purpose Flour, Warm water, Garlic, Salt, olive oil, 
I only single rise my pizza dough (that is I let the machine mix and knead  and then I remove the ball to rise in a glass dish).  What other methods do  you use (I seem to have trouble with the manual setting on mine, it kneads  forever, or so it seems).
