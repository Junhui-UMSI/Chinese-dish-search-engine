Baileys Cheesecake
Cheese, ricotta, Butter, Salt, Graham cracker crumbs, coars, Cream cheese, Sugar, Vanilla, Eggs, lightly beaten, 
Combine crumbs and butter, press over bottom and sides of greased 9-inch  springform pan.  Chill.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Beat together  ricotta and cream cheese until smooth.  Add remaining ingredients, beat  until smooth.  Pour mixture into pan.  Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes or until  firm in middle (place a shallow pan of water in oven to cook under my  cheesecakes so they dont crack).  Cool 20-30 minutes in pan. Cool  completely.
