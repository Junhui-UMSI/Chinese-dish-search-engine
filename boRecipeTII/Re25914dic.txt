Arrange half the bread slices in a  single layer in bottom of greased 9 x 13 pan or casserole. Sprinkle with  half the crumbled bacon, onions and cheese. Repeat layers.    Combine remaining ingredients; pour over top layer in pan.  (May be  prepared to this stage in advance and stored in refrigerator until an hour  before serving time.)    Bake at 375 degrees until mixture is set and top is puffed and golden,  about 50 minutes. This will serve 8. The recipe can be halved and baked in  an 8 inch square pan for about 40 minutes.
