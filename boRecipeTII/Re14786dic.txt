Success Hints                             -------------    * Experiment with unsalted seeds for different taste and texture; try equal  amounts of pumpkin seeds, flax seeds and sunflower seeds.    For best results, use the "extra knead" process and add seeds near the end  of the first knead.    Gluten is available in health food stores & nutritional departments.    Use regular, rapid bake or timed bake cycle. Posted by Dan Klepach to the  Fidonet COOKING echo  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #299    Date: Fri, 1 Nov 1996 14:46:14 -0500    From: BobbieB1@aol.com
