Cheese Tartlets
Sugar, Butter, (8 oz) cream cheese, Vanilla extract, FILLING, Egg, Sugar, Graham cracker crumbs, Crust, 
Crust: Combine above ingredients and pat approximately 1 TBS. around sides  and bottoms of fluted paper lined miniature cup cake pans. You may increase  crumbs too 1 1/2 cup and butter to 1/4 lb. Gives you a little more crumbs  to work with in patting in pans.    FILLING: Combine above ingredients and beat 15-20 minutes on whip cycle.  Pour heaping TBS. of cheese mixture into crusts. Bake 10-12 minutes in  pre-heated 375 degree oven. Cool in muffin tins, refrigerate or freeze.  Just before serving fill dents on top of each tartlet with Solo pie  filling, cherry, raspberry, etc.    I usually doubled the recipe and sometimes used a preserve to top the  tartlets for serving.
