Bbq Sauce #4
Dry mustard, olive oil, Basil; crushed, Beer, Garlic, Red wine vinegar, Ketchup, Dijon mustard, Ground pepper; to taste, Red chiles; crushed, Worcestershire Sauce, Brown sugar, 
Combine vinegar, beer, Worcestershire, in saucepan over medium heat add  brown sugar & stir to dissolve, add all the rest and bring to a boil.  Simmer 20 min. Heat uncovered just before use. If using pork, parboil for  10 min., then bake till almost done, brush on sauce & grill for no more  than 20 min. Beef ribs benefit from a water catch pan in the grill under  large rib sections, slows the cooking, brush sauce on last 2 turn.    NOTES : Good for beef ribs  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Christopher E. Eaves" <cea260@airmail.net> on  Feb 6, 98
