The Pheasant:  =============         With a sharp boning knife, carefully remove each breast half from  the pheasants and set aside.  Remove the legs with thighs attached.  To bone each leg-thigh portion, use a sharp boning or paring knife to  slit the leg and thigh meat, cutting parallel to the bones.  Carefully  scrape thigh meat away from the bone.  Cut through the joint between  the leg and thigh, keeping meat in 1 piece.  Scrape away all remaining  thigh meat and cut or pull out thighbone.         Use a cleaver to cut off the knob end of the leg.  Scrape meat from  the gone and pull out the bone.         Refrigerate meat, covered.
