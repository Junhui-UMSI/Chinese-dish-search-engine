hi everyone, ive been a lurker on this list for waay too long, so its  about time I contributed something! I adapted this recipe from the BBCs  vegetarian magazine, April 97 issue    Note: the original recipe also called for 2 tsp of wholegrain mustard,  again I didnt have any, so just left it out.    Boil potatoes 15-20 mins, till soft enough to mash. Steam shredded cabbage  5-8 mins (it needs to retain some firmness) Drain potatoes and mash, add  all other ingredients and mix well. Shape into 4 burgers. Heat griller, and  line with foil. Place burgers under griller, grill till nicely browned -  mine took about 8-10 mins on each side. Be careful when turning them - I  used an eggflip to slide them over. Serve with some lightly steamed veg  and crusty bread - Yummo!
