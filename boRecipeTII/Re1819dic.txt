Chicken Millicent
Dry spaghetti sauce mix, Dry white wine, Tomatoes; quartered, Fresh mushrooms, Chicken; cut up,or whatever, 
Put chicken in cooker (I always skin it first). Combine spaghetti mix and  wine, pour over chicken. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 to 7 hours. Turn  control to HIGH, add tomatoes and mushrooms. Cover and cook for 30 to 40  minutes till tomatoes are done. NOTE: In a pinch, you could use canned  tomatoes and mushrooms.
