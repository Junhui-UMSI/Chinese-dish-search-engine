Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Celebrations: Holiday Brunch: Celebrations is a class that shows you how to  have a dining event that not only tastes good and looks good but is  generally enjoyable. Fitting with the holiday season, we worked on a  holiday brunch. Aside from these recipes, we learned about table  presentation, planning and tricks to make the event memorable. We also  created several types of food related decorations.    In a large bowl combine all the ingredients. Tie 1-tablespoon batches of  the mix in cheese cloth or muslin bags and tie with string. As decoration,  you can tie a stick of cinnamon to the outside of the bag. One bag makes  enough to flavor 1 quart of cider.    To make mulled cider, put the bag in a pot with 1 quart of cider. Bring to  a slow boil and simmer for 20 minutes, covered. A 1/4 cup of rum may be  added to spice it up a bit more.
