Ground turkey from the supermarket works well in this recipe.    COMBINE BRANDY, THYME, CLOVES, onion, pepper and salt in a small saucepan  and place over medium heat. Cook 3 minutes, then scrape into the bowl of a  food processor. Add the bacon and puree until smooth. Place the mixture in  a mixing bowl, add the ground turkey and egg whites and mix well. Stuff the  mixture into casings or form into patties. Grill or cook sausages and serve  immediately.
