Add onions, garlic & carrots;  stir only until onions are clear, making sure not to brown any of the  vegetables. Add oregano, bay leaves & salt & stir to mix; then add vinegar  & water & bring to a boil, stirring often. Continue to boil & stir until  salt is dissolved then add remaining oil & return to a boil. Stir in  jalapenos & remove from heat. Fill 16-20 hot sterilized 1-pint canning jars  (or 8-10 1-quart jars), leaving 1-1/2 inches head space. Wipe rims clean  with boiling water, then seal jars tightly with canning lids & rings. Cool  filled jars at room temperature, out of drafts. Store in a cool, dry place  until ready to use.
