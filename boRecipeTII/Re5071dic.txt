Picnic Potato Salad
Potatoes, Celery, Eggs, Fresh parsley, Dill relish, Mayonnaise, Sweet relish, Yellow mustard, Salad olives, Salt, Onions, Louisiana hot sauce, 
Boil potatoes in their jackets.  Let cool, then peel and chop into  large chunks.  Mix mayonnaise, yellow mustard, Louisiana hot sauce,  and salt together.    Add potatoes, along with the rest of the  ingredients, and mix well.  You can make this the day before and  refrigerate it overnight. You may need to put a little more dressing  on it if it is a little dry. "Serves 8 Cajuns or 24 other peoples for  a good picnic." From Justin Wilsons "Outdoor Cooking With Inside  Help"
