Bisquick, coating mix (pork, Monterey Jack cheese, Eggs, Jalapeno chiles, Pork sausage, 
Note: Enough talk about Chili Poppers. Try an Aramdillo Egg!  Its a great  recipe that I got from the Sept/Oct 1990 issue of Chile Pepper Magazine  (Ive been subscribing for years!) This is still one of my favorite recipes  from the mag. They suggest Cadillac Bar Poppers as a libation w/your  Armadillo Eggs.    Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grate 2 oz. of cheese and set aside. Grate the  other 6 ozs of cheese and mix it with the sausage and Bisquick. Knead well  and set aside. Slit and scrape seeds from each jalapeno pepper, leaving the  stems on. Rinse the jalapenos and stuff each with some of the 2 ozs of  cheese that was set aside. Separate the sausage dough into patties and form  around the stuffed pods. Made sure the ends are closed and only the stems  are showing.    Beat the eggs in a small bowl and set aside. Spread coating mix on a plate.  Dip each covered pepper into egg and roll in coating mix. Bake on cookie  sheet for 30 minutes, turning each one over after 15 mintues. Serves 6 as  appetizer.
