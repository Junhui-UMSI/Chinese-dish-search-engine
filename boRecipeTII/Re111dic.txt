The King Cake, surely the most popular of all Mardi Gras foods has a  history rich in tradition. The history of the King Cake dates back to the  Middle Ages. During this time Epiphany, the 12th night of Christmas, and  the end of the Christmas season came to be known as the "12th Night" -- a  time for pageants, and giving special "King" presents to children. These  king presents were in memory of the Three Wise Men or Kings who followed a  star and paid homage to Christ.    The king cake, an oval shaped braided coffee cake decorated with cinnamon  and sugar is always adorned with the official Mardi Gras colors - gold (for  power), green (for faith), and purple (for justice) - and contains a tiny  plastic baby. The baby has replaced the coin used in medieval times. The  person who gets the slice with the baby must host the next party or buy the  next cake. At some parties, the person who gets the plastic baby gets  crowned king or queen. This opens up endless party possibilities, and the  ritual is a popular custom in family groups, offices, schools and Mardi  Gras organizations. One of the carnival organizations in past days actually  chose their king and queen of Mardi Gras based on who found the bean in the  King Cake.    Today you will find a king cake at almost every Mardi Gras celebration.  Traditionally the cake is a gift shared by friends and family, and eaten  between the Twelfth Night and Fat Tuesday, but you will see the king cake  begin to appear during Christmas.
