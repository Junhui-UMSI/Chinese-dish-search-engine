* (I omitted the yellow, it was fine without)    **(may substitute red wine or balsamic vinegar - I used red wine)    ***(I used the Osem powder, adding about 2 teaspoons to the water, to keep  it parve)    When surfing the net a couple of weeks ago I came across this site:  www.virtualcities.com -- 1st Travelers Choice Internet Cookbook. This  recipe was submitted by the Echo Lake Inn in Ludlow, Vermont. I made it  last Shabbes, and it is definitely a keeper!    Marinate vegetables in vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. Bring chicken stock  to a rapid boil and add couscous all at once, stirring rapidly. Remove from  heat cover and let sit 5 to 7 minuets or until all liquid is absorbed.  Place on a flat baking pan and separate with a fork. Cool in refrigerator.  Blend marinated vegetables with couscous.
