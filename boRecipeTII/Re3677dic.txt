Preheat oven at 350.  In a mixing bowl, combine margarine and sugar.  Add 1  tablespoon water and almond extract; mix well.  Stir in flour until well  combined.  Cover and chill for 2 to 3 hours.  On a floured surface, roll  dough to a 1/4" thickness.  Using envelope as a pattern, cut shapes in  dough with a sharp knife.  Reroll dough scraps.  Cut out 1" squares of  dough to resemble stamps.  Transfer letters and stamps to unprepared baking  sheet with a spatula.  Using a paintbrush, paint, addresses, postmarks, and  stamps with Edible Decorator Paint.  Allow each color of paint to dry  thoroughly before painting with additional colors.  Bake cookies for 25 to  30 minutes, removing stamps if they start to brown. Cool slightly and  remove from baking sheet.  Cook completely.  Prepare powdered sugar icing  and attach stamps to letters.  To make Edible Decorator Paint, mix egg yolk  with 1/2 teaspoon water.  Divide mixture into several small cups. Add paste  food coloring as desired.  If needed, add additional water, 1 drop at a  time, to make paint the consistency of ink. Use thin coats of the paint.  Allow each color to dry before proceeding with next color. In recipes using  opaque or pastel paint, add white, paste or liquid, food coloring. This  improves opaqueness and removes much of the yellow color of the egg yolk.  Food painted with paint should be returned to the oven for a few minutes to  set the paint and cook the egg yolk.
