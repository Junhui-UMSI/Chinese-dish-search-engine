Raita (Cucumber and Yogurt Salad
Ground roasted cumin seeds, Kosher salt, Green chili -- seeded/sliced, Opt, Ripe tomatoe, Plain yogurt, Finely chopped fresh mint --, Sour cream, Coriander leaves -- OR, Dried mint leaves, Cucumbers, OR, 
1.  Peel the cucumbers and cut them in half.  Seed, and grate into a bowl.  2.  Wash the tomatoe and wipe dry.  Seed, and cut into thin shreds. 3. Slit  and seed the chili, cut it into thin shreds, and add. 4. Put the yogurt,  sour cream, cumin, and mint or coriander leaves in another bowl, and mix  thoroughly.  Refrigerate for a few hours until needed. 5. When ready to  serve, mix and garnish. Personally, I like this recipe without the tomatoes  and chili, and prefer table salt. I use it like a condiment to be eaten  with the main dish..
