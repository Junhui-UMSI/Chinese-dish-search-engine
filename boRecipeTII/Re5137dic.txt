Pierogi Cabbage Filling
Onion, Garlic, Sauerkraut -- 10 oz. cans, Butter, Cabbage, 
Parboil cabbage in boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes.  Rinse, drain,  cool, and thoroughly wring moisture from cabbage and sauerkraut; set aside.  The drier the cabbage and sauerkraut the less time required to complete  cooking.  Saute onion and garlic in 2 Tbsp. butter.  Add cabbage and  sauerkraut and remainder of butter; cook for approximately one half hour or  until cabbage is soft and mixture is "reasonably" dry.  It is important  that the mixture not be too moist in order to prevent wetting dough during  the filling process ... wet dough will cause pierogi to break open during  cooking! Allow mixture to stand in refrigerator (in covered bowl) for  twenty four hours prior to filling pierogi dough.
