Tagarin
Virgin olive oil, Egg yolks, jumbo, All-purpose flour, plus, Salt, For dusting work surface, 
Use standard well technique, placing yolks only in initial well.    Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board.  Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and any other  flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and  flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim  of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain  the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough  will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.    Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands  primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board  and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the board and  continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a  little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust  your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for  30 minutes at room temperature. Note: do not skip the kneading or resting  portion of this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.
