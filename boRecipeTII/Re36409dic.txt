Beer Bread
SELF-RISING flour, Sugar, Beer, 
Mix together and put in greased loaf pan. My recipe doesnt have the  temperature or time on it, but, I would guess 375 F for about 35 minutes.  Honestly, this bread is good!!    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Pat Hogberg <DHOGBERG@ALPHA.ALBION.EDU> on Sep  11, 1997
