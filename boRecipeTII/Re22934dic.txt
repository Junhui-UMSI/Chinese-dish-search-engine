Spread both sides with mustard.    In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add chicken and cook 3-4  minutes on each side. Stir salsa and lime juice together and add to  skillet.    Simmer gently, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through and sauce has  thickened, about 6-8 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro.    Personal note: I first tried this in the fall of 1993, and it quickly  became a family favorite. Both hubby and I have taken the leftovers to  "nuke" for lunches the next day. It keeps several days in the fridge.    EAT-L DIGEST 19 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
