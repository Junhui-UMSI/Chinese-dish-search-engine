Line with a double thickness of wax paper and grease the  paper.    2) Put the almonds, peels, cherries and raisins in a large bowl. Sift  together the flour, salt, nutmeg and add 1/2 cup to the fruit, mixing  thoroughly to make sure that all the fruit are well coated.    3) In a mixer, cream the butter and gradually add the sugar. When fluffy,  add the eggs one at a time. add the vanilla, lemon peel,and brandy, then  add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating at low speed after each addition.  Add the batter to the floured fruit, stirring and mixing with your hands  until the whole is thoroughly blended.    4) Place in the prepared pans.    5) Put a shallow pan of water on the oven floor (if necessary, add boiling  water during the cooking). Preheat the oven to 300 degrees and bake the  cake on the middle shelf - 3 hours for the the large, 2 hours for the small  or until a cake tester comes out clean.    Let cool completely on a cake rack before unmolding, then wrap.    The cake can be covered with almond paste if you wish.    Wrapped in wine or brandy, soaked cloth, then in foil, this cake will keep  a year in a cool place.    Best very thinly sliced.
