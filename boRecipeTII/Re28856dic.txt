In a bowl, cover the noodles in lukewarm water and let stand to soften,  about 15 minutes for fresh noodles or about 30 minutes for dry noodles.  Drain and cut into 6-inch lengths, if desired. Set aside.    In a small bowl, combine the fish sauce, vinegar, sugar, and paprika,  catsup, or tomato paste.  Set aside.    Heat a wok or saute pan over high heat.  Add the oil and swirl to coat the  pan.  Add the pork or chicken, garlic, and chili and stir-fry for 1 minute.  Stir in the drained noodles and the reserved fish sauce mixture and  stir-fry about 30 seconds.  Push the noodles to one side, pour in about a  tablespoon more oil, if necessary, and add the eggs; cook just until  slightly set, then break them up.  Add the shrimp and stir-fry just until  they turn pink.  Add most of the bean sprouts, the green onion, and 1/4 cup  of the peanuts and stir-fry until the sprouts and onions are crisp-tender,  1 to 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a serving plate.    Sprinkle with the chopped cilantro, remaining 1/4 cup peanuts, and dried  shrimp.  Garnish with the remaining bean sprouts, cilantro sprigs, and  lemon or lime wedges, and serve immediately. Diners squeeze lemon or lime  juice to taste.    Serves 8 as a pasta course, or 4 as a main course    From: stigle@cs.unca.edu (Sue Stigleman)
