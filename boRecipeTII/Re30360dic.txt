Hi - As a chocolate lover I was pleased to find these recipes (and a few  more) on the cooking light website last evening. I havent tried them, but  they sound yummy. The url for this site is:  http://www.pathfinder.com/@@4SwYyQYA8y8sh9H1/cl/search.html    1 Combine first 3 ingredients in a small bowl; stir well. Add 1 tablespoon  of egg white (discard remaining egg white) and 1 tablespoon melted  margarine; toss with a fork until moistened. Press into bottom and up sides  of a 9-inch pie plate coated with cooking spray. Bake at 325 degrees for 20  minutes; let cool on a wire rack.    2 Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, salt, and egg in a large bowl; stir  well with a wire whisk, and set aside.    3 Heat milk over medium-high heat in a medium heavy saucepan to 180 degrees  or until tiny bubbles form around edge (do not boil). Remove from heat.  Gradually add hot milk to sugar mixture, stirring constantly with whisk.  Return milk mixture to pan. Add 1 tablespoon margarine, and cook over  medium heat 4 minutes or until thickened and bubbly, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat to low, and cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat; stir in vanilla. Place pan in a large ice-filled bowl for  25 minutes or until egg mixture cools to room temperature, stirring  occasionally.    4 Remove pan from ice. Fold in the sliced banana, and spoon mixture into  prepared crust. Spread whipped topping evenly over filling, and top with  chocolate curls. Cover loosely, and chill 4 hours. Yield: 8 servings  (serving size: 1 wedge).
