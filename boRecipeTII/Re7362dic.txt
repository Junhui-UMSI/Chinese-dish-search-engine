Pork Chops That Make You Crazy
Cayenne pepper, Paprika, Black pepper, 4.5-ounce pork chops (I use, Garlic powder, White pepper, Salt, Thyme, Tablepoons vegetable oil, Onion powder, All-purpose flour, 
In small bowl mix ingredients through cayenne pepper. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon  of mixture, or more to taste, on each side of chops, rubbing it in to  distribute it evenly.    In large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat about 3  minutes.    Meanwhile, dredge half of the chops in flour, shake off excess flour and  slide each chop into oil, making sure bottom of each chop is well coated  with oil. Cook 2 1/2 minutes, then turn chops and reduce heat to medium.  Cook about 3 minutes and turn again. Cook 1 minute longer then turn once  more. Cook 1 more minute, then remove chops to serving plate and keep warm.  Discard oil remaining in pan and wipe out skillet. Add remaining tablespoon  of oil and flour and cook remaining chops as above. Serve immediately to 4.    This recipe came from the Chicago Tribune several years ago.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Mar 97 by Patricia A Burns <pburns1@JUNO.COM> on  Mar 10, 1997
