Prohibition Pilsner
Hop-flavored malt syrup, Dry lager yeas, Compressed yeast (or Vierka, Granulated sugar, Cake, 
Dissolve syrup and sugar in boiling hot water---pour into cold water  to  make  five gallons---allow to further cool for two hours, then  add  one  cake  yeast.  Cover crock or other fermenting vessel with  clean  cloth.  Keep  in  a cool, dark place. Watch carefully and when  bubbles  of  gas  cease  coming  to  surface fermentation has been  completed  and  liquor  should be quite clear (approximately four days). Now siphon off clear  liquid to another clean crock, leaving  the  thick sediment behind. To the  liquor in the second crock add 1/4 pound  granu- lated sugar and stir until  dissolved. Fill into bottle by siphoning  or pouring. Cap and immediately  store in a cool dark place.  The  beverage will be ready for use when  clear---requires one to two weeks. One crock can be eliminated if the  liquid is siphoned directly into  the bottles from the fermented crock. In  this case, place 1/2 teaspoon sugar in each pint or one teaspoon in each  quart bottle. Best consistent  re- sults can be obtained if a five gallon  bottle is used instead of a crock for the fermenting vessel, using a water  seal. All vessels  and  tubing should be entirely clear and sanitary before  use. A 2-3% warm lye  solu- tion is an excellent one for the purpose. Rinse  with water after the use of lye solution. Use of Hydrometer is not  necessary if the above  direc- tions are followed. The specific gravity at  the time of  bottling  will however, be 1.012 - 1.016. This is the third  and final installment  of  traditional  "Prohibition Pilsner" recipes  received anonymously, presumably from the  makers  of Blue Ribbon malt  syrup, in the mid-1970s.  Previous  installments  of Historical Homebrew  appeared in Homebrew Digest # 795 and # 800. This is posted here purely for  historical interest, and not as  a  recommended recipe, although the  techniques called for here seem to be much  closer    to currently recommended procedures for beginning brewers, than in the  earlier  historical postings. The format of the original is retained  as  much as possible.
