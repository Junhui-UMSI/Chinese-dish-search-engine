Sweet apples and salty bread provide an intriguing contrast in taste. To  ensure that the hearth bread remains light and crisp, keep the dough soft:  Dont work in too much flour and knead it gently.    Makes 1 loaf (6 servings)    1. In large bowl of heavy-duty electric mixer, combine 1 1/2 cups flour,  the yeast, and salt. Slowly beat in water, 1/4 cup olive oil, and the  honey; vigorously beat mixture 10 minutes. Cover bowl with clean cloth and  let dough rise in warm place, away from drafts, 40 minutes.    2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt butter. Add apple slices and saute  until very lightly browned; set aside.    3. After dough has risen 40 minutes, turn out onto floured surface. Gently  knead in as much of remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to form a very  soft dough - about 1 minute. Gently work apple slices into the dough.    4. Lightly oil large baking sheet. With floured fingers, shape dough into a  9 inch round on oiled sheet. Cover with clean cloth and let rise in warm  place, away from drafts, until double in size - about 30 minutes.    5. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. With pastry brush, coat top of dough round  with 2 tablespoons olive oil; sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired. Bake  15 to 20 minutes or until hearth bread is browned.    6. Drizzle hearth bread with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and serve  warm.
