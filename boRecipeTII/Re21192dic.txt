1. Lightly salt the grated cucumbers, place in a colander or strainer, and  allow to drain for 15 minutes.    2. Combine the drained cucumbers with the rest of the ingredients.    3. Chill for 30 minutes.    Menu Planning: * Here is a Greek version of a salad that is common  throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. While  appropriate as a side dish with foods of those regions, Tzatziki is also a  refreshing counterpoint for a spicy Eggplant-Spinach Curry (p. 355) or  Golden Curry (p. 359).
