Thai Khanom Pad Ka (White Radish Cake)
Water., White radish, Rice flour, 
method trim, peel, and dice the radish, then in a food processor reduce it  to a fine puree (you may well have to do this in batches). Combine with the  flour and water, and mix thoroughly. Turn into a shallow baking tray or  heat proof dish, at least 8 inches square to form a thin layer. Place in a  steamer, and steam for about 30 minutes. It is cooked when a knife slipped  into the mixture comes out clean. Allow to cool completely, and then cut  into 1" squares.    ~ --  Colonel Ian F.

The "white radish" in question, known in Thai as phak ka hua or  sometimes as hua chai thao, is also known as mooli, or Chinese Radish, and  resembles nothing quite so much as an albino carrot! The resultant  snacklets can be eaten on their own, or used as a base for prawn or pork  spread and fried to form a canope served with prik nam som or other Thai  dipping sauce.
