Waldines Crockpot Pasta
Garlic, Onion, Small shells, pasta, Sour cream, Ground beef, Sliced mushrooms w/juice  , mozzarella, 
Saute meat, onions and garlic until meat is no longer pink. Drain and mix  with mushrooms, juice, sauce and pasta. Put half in bottom of large  crockpot. Spred on sour cream (you may have some left over). Layer half of  mozzarella slices on top. Finish up with remaining half of meat mixture.  Top with remaining mozzarella slices. Cook on LOW for 4 to 5 hours. Youll  have enough to freeze in 2 small casseroles. This is very tasty. MM Waldine  Van Geffen vghc42a@prodigy.com. Lynn Thomas notes: Made this 12-11-97;  used 16 ounces shells (cooked for 7 minutes) and 1 pound ground beef. This  was an excellent recipe and very easy to do.
