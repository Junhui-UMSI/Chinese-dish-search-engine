Whole Striped Bass with Fennel and Tomatoes in a Roasting B
Tomatoes, peeled, seeded,, Dry white wine, Salt and pepper, Fennel bulb, Coriander seeds, Striped bass, (4 pound), Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 
Scrape off any scales adhering to the fish and refrigerate. Cut the  feathery green fronds off the fennel and reserve. Cut off the stalks at the  top of the bulb and discard. Peel the tough, stringy fiber off the outside  with a vegetable peeler and then cut the fennel into 8 wedges. Simmer the  wedges in a non aluminum pan with the white wine, coriander seeds, olive  oil, and salt and pepper over low heat until they soften but retain some  crunch, about 20 minutes. Cool the liquid. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees  F. Rinse and dry the fish, season with salt and pepper, and slide it into  an oven roasting bag. If the fish is too large, you can cut off his head,  but avoid this; a headless fish is less dramatic. Put all the ingredients  from cooking fennel, including any liquid, in the bag with the fish. Season  the tomatoes with salt and pepper and place in the bag along with the  reserved fennel fronds. Push down along the bag to squeeze out excess air  and seal the bag at one end with string.    Carefully place the bag with the fish in an oval baking dish or on a sheet  pan (it is easier to bake fish on something you can take straight to the  table) and bake for about 15 minutes per inch of thickness. Cut the bag  open at the table and serve with fennel and chopped tomatoes.
