Swedish Spritzar Cookies
Butter or margarine, Sugar, Flour, sifted, Almond extract, Egg, Vanilla, Baking Powder, 
Thoroughly cream butter or margarine and sugar. Add egg, vanilla, and  almond extract; beat well.    Sift together flour and baking powder; add gradually to creamed mixture,  mixing to a smooth dough. Force dough through cooky press onto ungreased  baking sheet. Sprinkle with colored sugar, if desired.    Bake in hot oven, 400 degrees 8 to 10 minutes. Cool.    Variations: substitute other extracts for the almond extract, and  experiment with coloring the dough with food coloring and trying different  toppings.  In addition to the recipes following, Ive also tried raspberry  extract and red food coloring, and maple extract topped with walnut pieces  and cinnamon sugar (put the walnuts on first, then the sugar!). Ive used  candy coated multi-colored mini chocolate chips for a topping, as well as  the usual jimmies and other sprinkles.                                 per Bobbie Beers                               Fidonet COOKING echo
