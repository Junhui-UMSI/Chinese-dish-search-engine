Select dough cycle. When complete, punch dough down by starting bread  machine, let stir a few seconds, then stop machine. Place on floured work  surface and let rest five minutes. Divide into two balls. Roll each into  10x6 rectangle. Fold dough in half lengthwise, then fold again. Pinch seams  together. Place seam side down on bakers peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cut  top of loaf with 1/4" deep diagonal slashes at 2" intervals. Cover and let  rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven and baking stone to 450F. Sprinkle  stone with cornmeal. Transfer dough from peel to stone. Bake for 22-28  minutes. Create steam for a crispy crust. NOTE  : If using a baking sheet, rather than a baking stone, sprinkle with  cornmeal before placing dough on pan, then cover and let rise.    This recipe is from THE ULTIMATE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK by Tom Lacalamita.  I noticed in an earlier post, a comment about using lemon juice. Many of  the recipes in his book call for lemon juice, I think it really makes a  difference. I often add it to my recipes. Also, dont omit the rye flour.  Although its a small amount, the rye lends a wonderful texture to the  bread. This is excellent bread...with or without a banneton!
