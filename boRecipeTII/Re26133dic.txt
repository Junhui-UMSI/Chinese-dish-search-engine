Tofu Yeasties #1
Nutritional yeast, Firm tofu, Soy sauce, 
If youve tried tofu burgers youll love Tofu Yeasties!  They are also  quick and easy.    1. Slice firm tofu about 1/4 inch thick (to yield the largest patty).  Be  sure to use a high quality firm tofu.    2. Dip the tofu slices in soy sauce (both sides).    3. Place the slices on a plate of nutritional yeast until they are  thoroughly breaded (dont use brewers yeast unless you know the  difference!). I prefer to use Red Star brand nutritional yeast.    4. Fry both sides at medium high on a non-stick surface until light brown.   No oil is required.    5. Serve as you would any veggiburger.
