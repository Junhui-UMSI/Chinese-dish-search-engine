Saute onions, cumin, parsley, garlic and paprika in vegetable stock in  large stock pot. Add pinto beans, tomato, and achiote and simmer for about  1 hour. Add about 4 cups of cooked brown rice and let stand for about 1  hour.    I usually make this in a crock pot.  Just add sauted onions and spices to  the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot and let it cook overnight.    I add the cooked rice the next morning and leave the pot on all day.    The chili usually comes out quite runny until you add the cooked rice and  let it sit. The rice absorbes most of the moisture leaving a thick hearty  chili.    I use the Lundberg Farms rice blends especially the japonica blend and the  christmas blend.    Posted by cscalzi@hi.com (Casey Scalzi) to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 13  Issue 23] Dec. 23, 1994.
