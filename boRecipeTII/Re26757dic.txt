Here is a recipe I got from a new magazine called "New Choices". We had it  last night and enjoyed it - yum!    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a baking dish large enough to hold  all of the fruit. Place the fruit in the baking dish along with the  raisins. Drizzle on the honey. Sprinkle on the spices. Mix together the  lemon juice, apple juice and whiskey. Toss with the fruit. Place in the  oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the fruit is very soft. Stir  every 10 to 15 minutes.    Serve either hot or at room temperature.  Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Shirley Bumbalough" <sbumbalo@aramco.com> on  Feb 5, 1998
