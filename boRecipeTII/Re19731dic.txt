Pour the boiling water over the TVP and let it sit for 10 minutes. Saute  the gingerroot in a very small anount of oil or other liquid. Add the soy  sauce, bean paste, salt and TVP. Cook very very gently and stir frequently  as it burns easily. Cook about 5 minutes and set aside.    Cook the bean threads in the broth until the broth has been absorbed by the  noodles. Add the noodles to the TVP mixture and stir until blended  evenly...ie. all the "ants" are distributed throughout. Enjoy!    Source: This is a dish that was a favorite at our local Chineses eatery. I  used to make it with ground turkey (before I saw the light) and have found  that TVP works just as well. Its hot and spicy...delicious and just a  little different.
