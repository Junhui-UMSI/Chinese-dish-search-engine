Trinidadian Sugar Cakes
Tea           Cream Of, Tea           Almond Essence, Sugar, Grated Coconut, Water, Few Drops Of Food, 
* (Very few! Otherwise youll have flourescent!)    1. Boil sugar and water to form a light syrup. 2. When bubbles the size of  small pearls appear, add grated cocunut and cream of tartar. 3. When the  cocunut mixture comes away from the sides of the pan easily, remove from  heat and beat with a spoon for 3-5 minutes. 4. Add essence and food  colouring and mix well. 5. Drop by spoonfuls on an oiled cookie or enamel  tray. 6. Allow to harden completely. 7. Store in an airtight container.    Tip:  You can divide the mixture into batches before Step 4 and add a      different color to each batch.  It looks really pretty in a glass      cookie jar after its finished.    In spite of the high sugar content, this is a really popular snack with  parents for the kids.  Its quick & easy. There arent any preservatives.  What you see is what you get.  You have to like coconut, though.
