Grill, covered with grill lid, over medium-high heat (350? to 400?) about  25 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness, basting with  3/4 cup Bell Pepper Sauce the last 15 minutes. Serve with remaining sauce.  Makes 6 servings.    Bell Pepper Sauce: Process all ingredients in an electric blender until  smooth, stopping once to scrape down sides. Makes 1 3/4 cups.
