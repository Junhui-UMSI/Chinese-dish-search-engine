Poached Sausage and Warm Potato Salad
Basic Vinaigrette (see, Dry white wine, Red potatoes of similar, Dijon mustard, Water, Sausage (in 4-oz links), Size, Parsley, Green onions -- minced, Recipe), 
1. In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with salted water. Bring to a boil  over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook until potatoes  are tender when pierced with a knife (20 to 25 minutes). Drain. When  potatoes are just cool enough to handle, slice them about 1/4 inch thick  and place in a bowl. Add mustard and toss gently to mix. Add green onions  and vinaigrette. Toss gently but well with your hands. Add 1/4 cup of the  parsley.    2. In a large skillet over high heat, bring wine and 2 cups water to a  boil. Add sausages and cover. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook  until sausages are firm and hot throughout (about 15 minutes).    3. Transfer potato salad to a warm platter. Surround with poached sausages.  Garnish with the remaining parsley. Serve immediately.    Recipe By     : The California Culinary Academy    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
