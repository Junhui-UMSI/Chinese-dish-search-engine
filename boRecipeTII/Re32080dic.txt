1. Heat a barbecue, grill or griddle. Season the chicken with salt and  pepper, then rub in one tablespoon of olive oil. Barbecue, grill or griddle  the chicken, skin-side down, for 8-10 minutes, then turn and cook for  another 8-10 minutes.    2. Meanwhile, boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes. Drain, then peel and  halve or quarter, depending on size. Mix the remaining oil with the vinegar  and shallots, season, then pour over the potatoes. Fry the bacon until  crispy, then stir it into the potato salad with the tarragon.    3. To serve, arrange mixed salad leaves on four plates, spoon over the warm  potato and bacon salad, and top with the chicken breasts.    NOTES : Barbecuing is such a great way to cook chicken because the slight  burnt tinge works so well with the natural sweetness of the meat. These  chicken breasts have just been seasoned, rubbed with oil and then  barbecued. Chicken with bacon or tarragon - or both - is a classic  combination, and the warm potatoes in olive oil dressing bring all the  tastes together, so this dish is a real treat. If you don?t have a  barbecue, simply grill or griddle the chicken instead. Push a knob of  butter under the skin of the chicken before cooking to give it a tastier,  more succulent finish; and why not squeeze some lemon juice after cooking  to lift the flavours. For a creamier potato and bacon salad, stir in two to  three tablespoons of mayonnaise.
