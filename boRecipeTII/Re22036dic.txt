Saute turkey cutlets 2 - 2 1/2 min  on each side or until no longer pink and lightly browned. Season with salt  and pepper to taste. Remove from skillet and set aside. Add mushrooms to  skillet. Saute 1 min or until almost tender. Add green onions and garlic;  saute 1 min more. Add wine to skillet. Stir together cornstarch and broth  until smooth; add to vegetable-wine mixture.
