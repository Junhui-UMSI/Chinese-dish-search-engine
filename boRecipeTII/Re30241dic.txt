Mix the nuts with  the flour, arrowroot and baking soda in a large bowl. Stir in the chopped  nuts.    In a separate bowl, mix together the bananas, oil, honey, eggs, lemon juice  and vanilla. Then pour the liquid mixture into the flour bowl and mix with  a few swift strokes. Do not overmix.    Pour into a greased 9x5" loaf pan or 2 7x3" pans. Bake large loaf at 350 F  for 55 to 60 min, or small loaves for 45 min or until a cake tester  inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let stand in the pan for 10 min,  then turn the loaf out onto a wire rack to cool. Servings: Makes 1 loaf.    Courtesy of Theresa Merkling. Reposted by Fred Peters.
