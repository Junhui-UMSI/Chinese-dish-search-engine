Tomato sauce, Butter, Oregano, Nutmeg, Bacon, Basil, Chicken Stock, Pepper, Thyme, Celery, Sage, Whipping cream, Tomato paste, Cooked lentils, Onions, Salt to taste, Cheddar cheese, 
Melt butter in a large saucepan or small stock pot. Saute chopped onions,  bacon and celery with pepper, basil, thyme, oregano, nutmeg and sage. When  vegetables are softened and bacon cooked add tomato sauce, tomato paste and  chicken stock, stir well to blend. Add lentils or split yellow peas. Lower  heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking.  Just before serving adjust spices and add salt to taste. Gently fold in  whipping cream and cheddar cheese.    Tom Bullick said, "Serves six to eight.  As the end of the season  approached and food supplies tightened at the lodge, I modified a  tomato-cheese recipe in the Harrowsmith Cookbook (vol. I), to provide a  real rib-sticking soup. Served with basic bread, its perfect after a long,  cold, wet day."
