Progres with Grand Marnier Ii (Buttercream)
Butter, milk, Egg yolks, Sugar, BUTTERCREAM, 
Buttercream:  ============         Heat the milk in a saucepan.         In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar.  Add  heated milk to egg/sugar mixture and whisk after off heat.         Put the mixture back in the saucepan and whisk while heating,  until smooth and fairly thick.  Remove from heat and strain back into  the bowl.         Cool in refrigerator.         When chilled, remove from refrigerator and place in a blender.  While blending on low speed, add butter a little at a time.  Blend  until smooth, then return to refrigerate.         Set aside for use in the rest of the Progres with Grand Marnier  recipe.
