Pyrizhky (Baked Turnovers)
Sour cream, Egg yolks, Egg White; Beaten With A, Butter; 1 Stick, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Coarse Sugar Crystals;, Salt, 
Combine the flour and cold butter in a processor or cut the butter with a  pastry cutter into coarse crumbs.  Add the egg yolks, salt, and cream and  process or knead lightly until the dough forms a ball.  Cut in half,  wrapping each have in plastic wrap, refigerate for at least 2 hours or  overnight.  Roll out half the dough on a lightly floured work surface, to  about 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds with a 3-inch cutter or wine  glass.  Place a spoonful of the filling on one side of each round, fold  the top over, brush with a little of the egg glaze and seal with a fork or  pastry cutter for a fancy edge.  Place each turnover on a lightly greased  or non-stick baking sheet and brush with the glaze then sprinkle with the  sugar crystals.  Bake in a preheated 375 Degree F. oven for about 20  minutes.  Cool on wire racks.    NOTE:    This is a short dough so a non-stick baking sheet would be the best.  If  it is not available, brush as little grease on the sheet as possible using  a pastry brush or new paint brush.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/day.zip
