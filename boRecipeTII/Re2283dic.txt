Since I didnt have a loaf pan except one for Microwave, I decided to cook  this recipe that way. It was a mistake - a loaf pan cooks the bread at the  ends, first, and the middle didnt begin to look done till Id cooked it 11  minutes. Next time, use the glass ring pan. Prepare ingredients: grate  orange rind and set aside, mash bananas, dice the apricots and chop the  nutmeats. Blend the oil, sugar and rind until creamy, then beat in the egg  substitute and banana pulp. With the mixer on slow, add the baking powder,  wheat germ and flour, then increase the speed to medium and beat the batter  until smooth. Fold in the apricots and nutmeats. Spray the ring mold with  canola oil spray. Scrape the batter into the mold and Microwave on high for  6 minutes (more if necessary). A toothpick inserted in the thickest part  should come out clean. Turn out on a plate on a rack and cool before  slicing.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Beth Ide" <rev_ide@email.msn.com> on Aug  17, 1998
