1. Puree the first four ingredients plus one clove of the garlic in a  blender or food processor (using the steel blade). Scrape the mixture into  a large heavy pot and add the beef.    2. Melt the lard, butter, or bacon drippings in a heavy skillet over medium  heat. Add the scallions, bell peppers, serrano chiles, sausage, and the  remaining garlic, and cook until the onions are translucent and the sausage  is browned.    3. Place the cumin seeds in a 300 oven for a few minutes until lightly  browned. Remove seeds from the oven and crush them with a mallet. Stir the  vegetables into the beef and tomato mixture. Add the salt ground chile,  cumin, and enough water or beer to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high  heat, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered for 4 to 6 hours. Taste and  adjust seasonings.
