Apple Cinnamon Syrup Pie
Butter, Cornstarch, Hot water, Graham cracker pie crust, Egg yolks, Knotts Berry Farm Light, Knotts Berry Farm Light, Egg whites, Salt, 
Combine syrup, hot water and butter and bring to a boil.  Mix cornstarch,  salt and enough cold water to make a thin paste, add egg yolks and beat  well.  Add cornstarch mixture to hot syrup gradually, return to heat and  cook until thickened to the consistency of pudding, stirring constantly.  Cool slightly.  Pour into pie crust.  Beat egg whites stiff, adding slowly  the tablespoon of syrup.  Pile on pie and brown in 400 F oven.    Notes: The filling never thickened enough.  Anything less than pudding  consistency just doesnt work.

We still need to get the consistency of the  filling right, but I think it may just be a matter of more corn starch.    * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJs BBS for Homemakers!
