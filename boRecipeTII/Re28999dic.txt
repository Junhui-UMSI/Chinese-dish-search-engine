Cut the very top of the pears off and save for garnish.  Next, peel the  pears, core, and sprinkle with lemon juice.  Set aside. Bring the water to  a boil and add the sugar, orange juice, and the pears.  Make sure the pears  are covered to the top with the water.  Cover the pan with a lid and simmer  until cooked.  If ripe, they should cook very fast.  Remove the pears when  done, stand on a plate, and refrigerate to cool.  Fill the pears with  vanilla ice cream. Caramel Sauce:  Put the sugar and water in a saucepan  and cook on med-high until it turns brown, but dont burn. Dont stir the  mixture.  When the sugar is colored, remove the pan from the heat. Be  careful not to burn yourself as the sugar will be very "hot". Carefully,  and quickly, stir the "hot" cream and butter into the sugar mixture. Let  the caramel sauce cool. ----Note:  The water gives the sauce the shine, not  the butter.  You can thin the sauce with a little cream to use any leftover  the next day. --Place caramel sauce on a plate, and place the pear on the  sauce. Garnish with the saved pear top.
