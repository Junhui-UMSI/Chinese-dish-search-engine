1. Preheat oven to 350F / 180C / Gas mark 4. French cut beans by cutting them in half  lengthwise, running the knife down the flat part between the seams of the  bean. If the beans are long, cut them at an angle into lengths of about 2  inches. Steam until crisply tender, from 3 to 5 minutes. When cooked  through, but still slightly crunchy, remove from the steamer.      2. In large skillet, melt 2 tbs of the butter and add the onion. Cook until  translucent. Stir in the sour, pepper and the green beans. Add salt to  taste. Mix to coat all ingredients and turn off heat.      3. Spread mixture into a lightly greased casserole. Layer the cheese over  it. Top with bread crumbs, and dot with the remaining butter. (At this  point the dish can be baked immediately or refrigerated for 24 hours; bring  to room temperature before cooking.)      4. Bake for 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the sauce  bubbly. Serve hot or warm.
