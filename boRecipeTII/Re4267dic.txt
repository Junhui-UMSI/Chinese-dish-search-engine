Perle Pale
Muntona ale yeast, Gypsum, (12.4 AAUs) Perle hops, Klages malt, Flaked barley, Willamette hops (finish), Toasted Klages malt, Cara-pils malt, (boil), Irish moss, 
The  1/2  pound of Klages malt was toasted in a 350 degree oven  for  10  minutes.  The  mash  was done  using  Papazians  temperature-controlled  method.  The  Willamette hops are added after the boil,  while  chilling  with  an  immersion chiller. The yeast is rehydrated in 1/2 cup  of  100  degree water. Perle pale was a beautiful light-golden ale, crisp yet  full-bodied.    Recipe By     : Serving Size:    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
