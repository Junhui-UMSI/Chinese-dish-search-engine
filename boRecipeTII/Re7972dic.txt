Pot-Roasted Veal
shallots, rosemary, Veal round roast, White wine, olive oil, Salt, Lemon juice, Unsalted butter, Black Pepper, 
MIX 3 TABLESPOONS OIL, shallots, half the rosemary, salt and pepper  together and rub all the surfaces of the veal. Cover and refrigerate for at  least 4 hours, or overnight. Heat remaining oil in a Dutch oven or covered  casserole over medium-high heat on top of the stove. Add the veal and sear  on all sides until browned, about 15 minutes. Use a pair of large spoons or  tongs to turn the meat so you dont pierce it. Drain excess fat. Add the  lemon juice, wine and remaining rosemary. Cover and reduce heat to low.  Cook for 2 hours, or until tender. Check periodically and, if the casserole  is dry, add a tablespoon or two of water. Remove the pot from the heat,  uncover and transfer the roast to a carving board. Let the roast rest for  15 minutes before slicing. Swirl butter into the cooking juices in the  casserole. To serve, cut the roast into 1/4-inch slices and arrange on a  serving platter. Strain the sauce over the meat and serve immediately.
