Basic Polenta
Unsalted butter, Coarse yellow cornmeal, Bay leaf, Water, Coarse salt, 
Anyone ever serve polenta with Q? Im thinking it might be good with a spicy  brisket or ribs. Anyone have any recipes? Here is the only one I have. I  just got it so I dont know if it is any good, but it came from the Chef Du  Jour show.    In a medium cast-iron saucepan or other heavy pot, bring all ingredients  except cornmeal to simmer over medium heat. Very slowly, begin to sift  cornmeal into the pan through the fingers of one hand, stirring constantly  with wooden spoon or whisk. Gradually sift remaining meal into the pan,  continue to stir and reduce heat to medium low. Continue to stir until the  polenta is smooth and thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan as it  is stirred, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf, pour polenta into a serving  bowl or onto a wooden board, and allow it to rest 10 minutes. To serve from  the bowl, dip a large spoon into water and scoop polenta onto individual  dishes, dipping the spoon into the water between scoops. To serve from the  board, cut polenta into segments with a thin, taut string or knife and  transfer to plates with a spatula or cake knife.
