Frog Legs
Salt, Buttermilk, Butter, Garlic, frog legs, Water, 
Wash the frog legs well and place in a large bowl filled with the 1 1/2  quarts of water and 1/4 cup of salt. Allow to stand refrigerated for  approximately one hour and drain and rinse the frog legs. Cover with the  buttermilk in the same bowl and allow to stand for another hour  refrigerated. Drain, lightly rinse and pat dry. In a large frying pan melt  the butter and add the garlic. Saute over medium heat until the garlic is  soft but not browned. Add the frog legs and saute until cooked and lightly  browned. About 10 minutes. Do not over cook.    NOTES : When cooking these for a large group like S.C.I. I will deep fry  the frog legs and then make the garlic butter sauce and add it to them  already cooked.  Not as good but for a large group its acceptable. I would  use legs as large as I could find.  Most are very small.  Be selective. I  also cook these in a tomato-basil sauce instead of the butter.  Do  everything the same up to the cooking and then just substitute the tomato  basil sauce.
