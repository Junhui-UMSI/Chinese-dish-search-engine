Phyllo Triangles Filled with Curried Walnut Chicken
Walnuts, Chicken breasts, Unsalted butter; melted (2, milk, Phyllo pastry, Flour, Curry powder, Butter, Salt, 
Thaw the phyllo dough overnight in the fridge, if frozen. Bake the chicken  breasts in buttered aluminum foil in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes.  Unwrap and cool. Remove skin and bones (unless you buy skinless/boneless  like I do--cause Im a wimp), and cut meat into small pieces. Heat 2 tb.  butter in small pan. Add flour and curry powder and cook over low heat 2  minutes. Add milk and whisk until thick. Season with salt, stir in walnuts  and chicken. Cool completely. Now for the hard part--best done with a  helper...but I did it on my own..    To assemble, melt and cool butter. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on flat surface  and brush with butter. Top with 2 more sheets buttering each. Cut sheet in  half lengthwise then cut each half crosswise into 6 equal parts. Spoon a  teaspoon filling onto end of each strip and for a triangle by folding right  hand corner to opposite side as you would a flag. Continue until every  strip is used. Repeat until all filling is used. Make sure you cover the  pastry when you arent used it--just a dish towel will work. Preheat oven  to 400. Place triangles on buttered sheet. Brush with butter and bake until  golden brown--about 10 minutes.    You can vary the phyllo ingredients--spinach and cheese makes a good veggie  alternative. You can keep this in the fridge, unbaked for 2 days, or you  can bake them and then freeze them. I made mine the day before and left  them in the fridge. Then I baked them right before the guests arrived. They  make great leftovers too.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Stephanie Rawlins <skrawlins@MINDSPRING.COM>  on Sep 20, 1997
