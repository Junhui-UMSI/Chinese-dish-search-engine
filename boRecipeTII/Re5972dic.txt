Pistachio-Orange Biscotti
Sugar, Pistachio nuts, unsalted,, Baking soda, Unsalted butter, room temp, Salt, Orange zest, grated, Eggs, Flour, Baking Powder, Vanilla extract, 
Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt, set aside.  Combine butter, sugar, orange zest and vanilla, beat on high until light  and fluffy. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Reduce  speed to low, add pistachios. Add flour mixture, mix just until  incorporated. Cover and chill one hour.    Preheat oven to 350. Butter and flour a large baking sheet.    Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a log (floured hands and surface)  1.5" in diameter. Arrange logs 5" apart on baking sheet.    Bake until light brown and firm, about 30 minutes. Logs will spread during  baking. Remove from oven, let cool slightly on sheet. Transfer to a work  surface with a spatula. Cut with a serrated knife on the diagonal into 3/4"  slices. Arrange cut side down on the baking sheet, and bake 15 minutes more  at 350 until golden brown.
