White Chocolate Sauce
Vanilla, Heavy cream, White chocolate, 
Makes 3 cups    Heat the heavy cream in a 2 1/2 quart saucepan over medium high heat. Bring  to a boil. Place the white chocolate in a stainless steel bowl and pour the  boiling cream over the chocolate. Tightly cover the top with film wrap and  allow to stand for 5 minutes. Remove the film wrap and whisk until smooth.    Cool the white chocolate sauce in an ice-water bath* to a temperature of  40-45 degrees F. about 15 minutes. When cold, stir in the vanilla. Transfer  to a plastic container. Securely cover and refrigerate until ready to use.  The White Chocolate Sauce may be kept refrigerated for up to 5 days.    * The simplest ice water bath consists of a large stainless steel bowl  partially filled with ice and water. There should be enough ice and water  in the bowl so that the outside surface of the container to be cooled will  be surrounded by ice and water. If the volume of the container to be cooled  is larger than can be accommodated by your largest bowl, then consider  using the kitchen sink.
