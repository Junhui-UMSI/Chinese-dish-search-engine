Sprinkle both with the parmesan cheese.  Scatter the avocado between the two ramekins, and then dot each with sour  cream. Break 2 eggs into each ramekin and then season with salt and pepper.  Sprinkle with basil. Place the ramekins in a shallow roasting pan. Pour  boiling water into the pan to reach 3/4 of the way up the ramekins. Place  in the oven and bake until the egg whites are milky and the yolks are set,  about 10 - 12 minutes. Serve immediately.    EAT-L Digest 16 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
