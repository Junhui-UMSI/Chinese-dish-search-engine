From "Mexican Light Cooking, " by Kathi Long (Perigee Books by Putnam).    Halve or quarter the fish filets so they will fit into a medium-sized  saucepan. Combine the chicken broth, jalapeno juice and lime juice. Bring  to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Add the fish pieces and simmer 3  to 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the fish cool in the  liquid for 30 minutes. Remove the fish and pat dry with paper towels. Place  the fish in a medium-size bowl and break into flakes with your fingers or a  fork. Add the scallions and tomato and toss to mix. Season with the salt  and pepper. Arrange 2 tablespoons of the fish filling down the center of  each taco shell. Divide the lettuce among the shells and top each taco with        1    tablespoon tomatillo salsa.
