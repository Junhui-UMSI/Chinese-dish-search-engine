Cut into halves and scrape out the  potato leaving about 1/4 inch of potato all around the skin for a bowl  effect. Mash the potatoes with the cream. Set aside. Melt the butter in a  saute pan and cook the onions and green pepper until the onions are  translucent. Add these to the potato mixture with the corned beef and the  rest of your seasonings. Mix well. Stuff the shells with your potato  mixture and bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.    6-8 people    Posted to recipelu-digest by GramWag <GramWag@aol.com> on Mar 16, 1998
