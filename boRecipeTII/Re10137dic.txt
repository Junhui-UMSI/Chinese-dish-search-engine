Quesidellias
Cheddar Cheese, Onions, chopped fine, Sour cream, Green peppers, chopped fine, Tomatoes, diced, Flour tortillas per, Mild salsa sauce, 
* other toppings can include sliced mushrooms canned, sliced black olives    ** note: I usually put the toppings in separate dishes so each child can  choose    *** paper cupcake holders are great for salsa sauce and sour cream; just  place a tablespoon or so in separate holders for dipping    1. prepare the toppings    2. place one tortilla on a cookie sheet (I can fit 3)    3. allow each child to top the tortilla with their choice of toppings    4. cover with another tortilla    5. bake until edges are golden brown or microwave until the cheese is  melted    6. cut into quarters    7. let each child choose either salsa sauce or sour cream or both (none)  for dipping    8. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Posted to EAT-L Digest 19 Feb 97 by Janine Vandenberg <jvandenb@KENT.NET>  on Feb 19, 1997.
