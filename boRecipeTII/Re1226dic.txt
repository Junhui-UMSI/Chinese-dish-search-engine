Crockpot Sandwiches/pork or Beef
Stewing meat, Pork, Onions, Brown sugar, Chili powder, Salt, Dry mustard, Vinegar, Worchestershire sauce, Tomato paste, Sandwich buns, 
In a crockpot, combine all ingredients except the buns. Cook on low setting  for 8-10 hours or til meat if tender. Stir with fork to break up pieces.  Serve on buns. *May use all pork or all beef. I found that the pork will  cook faster than the beef, so    I start the beef ahead of time then add the pork.    >From the recipe files of Carole Walberg    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Tracy Waltermyer <inadayz@nbn.net> on Aug  25, 1998,
