Stromboli- Remove dough from machine and roll into a rectangle. Spread  filling ingredients over the middle third of the rectangle so it runs the  lenght of the wide end. Fold one side over top of the filling and then the  other side on top of that; pinch ends closed. Place, seam side down, on a  lightly buttered baking sheet, cover and let rise for about 30 minutes.  Lightly olive oil top, and bake in preheated over 350F oven for 20-30  minutes or until done.
