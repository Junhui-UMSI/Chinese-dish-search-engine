Strawberry Leather
Lemon juice, Fresh strawberry puree, Sugar, Applesauce, 
Combine pureed berries and applesauce with lemon juice and sugar.  Line a  10x15 in jelly roll pan with plastic wrap.  Pour fruit into pan and spread  evenly.  Bake about 5 hours at 200F or until leather pulls away from wrap.    Flip leather onto counter, peel away plastic and remove any mixture that  has not "set."  Cut into slices and wrap each in plastic.
