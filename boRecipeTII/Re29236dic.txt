Here is one from the book, "Breads of New England", Im not sure of the  authors name, though.    In a saucepan, combine milk, shortening, sugar and salt. Place over medium  heat and stir until shortening is melted. Remove from heat and whisk in  cinnamon and nutmeg. Transfer to a large mixing bowl to cool.    When barely warm to the touch, stir in dissolved yeast and beaten eggs. Add  2 cups of flour and beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in enough  remaining flour to create a moist, stiff dough.    Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently working in additional  flour, if necessary. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Cover with a  clean towel and let rest 30 minutes.    Generously grease two baking sheets. Roll the dough to a 1/2 inch thickness  and cut out with a 2 1/2 inch doughnut cutter. Transfer to the prepared  baking sheets. (You will have about 36 doughnuts.) Brush with 1/4 cup of  the melted butter. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise. When  double in bulk, brush with remaining 1/4 cup butter. Place in a preheated  425? oven and bake 12-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on rack 5  minutes then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar while warm.
