This is a great way to use up leftover baked beans, and the regularity  with which this soup was served in Shaker communities indicates that they  had a lot of leftover beans. The dish was an absolute staple, and I think  it is really very good ... and certainly hearty.      Put the beans, water, onion, and celery in a saucepan and bring to a boil  for 30 minutes. They would rub this through a sieve, but I put mine through  the food processor. Do the same with the tomatoes and add to the soup. Add  the chili sauce and seasonings. Melt the butter and cook with the flour for  2 minutes to form a roux. Stir the roux into the soup and keep stirring  over medium heat until the soup thickens a bit.      You might also try mustard or horseradish for a variation. These  additions were common in the Hancock Shaker community.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
