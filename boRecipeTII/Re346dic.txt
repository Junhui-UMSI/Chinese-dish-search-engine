From Julia Leatherwood A fragrant tea cake with a crunchy top.    Preheat oven to 375F.  Oil a 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan.    Stir the topping ingredients together in a small bowl until smooth. Set  aside.    In a medium size bowl, stir the sugar, milk, butter and egg together until  smooth.    In another bowl, toss the flour with the baking powder and salt.   Stir this into the wet ingredients, and then fold in the blueberries and  lemon zest.    Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan, and sprinkle with the  topping. Bake until the topping is deep golden and has formed a thick  crust, 50 minutes.  Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer the bread  to a wire rack to continue cooling.
