Zuppa Di Pomodoro Freddo
Roma tomatoes, Yellow pepper, Cucumber, Onion, Garlic, Fresh Lemon Juice, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Salt, Pepper, Tabasco sauce, 
Blend all vegetables in a food processor or blender until smoothly  pureed, adding lemon juice and olive oil gradually. Add salt, pepper and  Tabasco sauce to taste. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes for  flavors to blend.      Serve chilled soup in a tureen garnished with thyme croutons. (I just cut  some fresh-baked pane di Ariccia from Carol FieldUs recipe, into 1/2-inch  cubes, brushed them with extra-virgin olive oil in which lots of chopped  fresh thyme had steeped for about 45 minutes, and baked at 350 degrees,  shaking the pan frequently, until golden).
