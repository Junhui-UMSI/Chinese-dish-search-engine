At night prepare the meat by cutting the pork, veal,  beef, chicken and pork fat into small cubes. Season  with salt, pepper and onion cut in rings. Cover and  put in a cool, fresh place. The next morning, cut the  potatoes in small cubes. Roll suet pastry into a  28xd4x1/2-inch strip. Cut lengthwise into halves. Line  a 10-inch three-quart casserole (or two smaller  casseroles) with one strip, bringing pastry over top  edge. fill pastry with alternate layers of meat and  potatoes until all ingredients are used. Cover all  with boiling water and seal pie with top layer of pie  shell. Cut hole in centre of pie shell to let steam  escape. Cover casserole with foil. Bake in moderate  oven (350F) for four hours. Remove the foil for the  last 30 minutes of baking time to brown the crust.  The original recipe of the Naskapis (native Indians of  Quebec) called for one rabbit, a partridge, one pound  of moose meat and one pound of lean pork instead of  the more mundane meats used today. Variation: Minced  meats may be used in lieu of cubes. Suet pastry:  Mix suet with flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in  enough water to moisten the flour. Gather dough  together and shape into a ball.
