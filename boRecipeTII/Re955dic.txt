Julie Sahni    Combine the cilantro, cucumber, red onion, and yogurt. Mix well, transfer  to a small serving bowl, and refrigerate until needed.    In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat; saute the cumin,  fennel, pepper flakes, coriander, and onions until the onions are lightly  browned, about 8 min. Add ginger, zucchini, and bell pepper, and mix well.  Pour 1/3 c water over the vegetables, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer  until vegetables are cooked but still firm, about 5 min.    Fold in the chickpeas and tomatoes. Increase heat to medium high, and cook  uncovered until the ragout is heated through and the sauce is thick, about  5 min. Season to taste. Serve ragout garnished with the cilantro-yogurt  mixture and accompanied by pita or nan bread.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 28, 98,
