Vegetable Spring Rolls
Squares bean curd, Carrot; peeled paper thin,, Potatoes; peeled and, Black pepper, Cellophane noodles, Tree ears; soaked in, Peanut oil, Bean sprouts, Dried rice papers, White part of leek; chopped, 
~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil. Cut the rice papers  into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water (use your fingers  or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will become flexible enough to  be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the filling on each paper and roll. Heat  the oil in a wok to about 350 deg. F. Place rolls, flaps-down, into oil and  cook 20 min (10 min each side), until completely done.   Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo. ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.  There is another form of spring roll skin which is inherently sticky and  stretchy (white and barely opaque), and doesnt require deep frying. (One  could lighly saute the carrots and potatoes beforehand.) I cant remember  what this wrapper is called.  BTW - With this alternate type of "spring  roll" fresh chinese parsley or cilantro is often included. ~- Side note:  About forming a spring roll from quartered rice paper...
