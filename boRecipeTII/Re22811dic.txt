For dough, soften yeast in lukewarm water.  (Use warm water for dry  yeast.)  Pour scalded milk over sugar, salt and shortening.  Cool to  lukewarm.  Stir in 1 cup flour and egg.  Add softened yeast and oats.  Stir in enough more flour to make a soft dough.    Turn out on lightly floured board or canvas; knead until smooth and  satiny; about 10 minutes.  Round dough into ball; place in greased bowl;  brush lightly with melted shortening.  Cover and let rise in warm place  until double in size, about 1 hour.    While dough is rising, prepare filling.  For filling, combine apricots,  water, lemon juice and sugar in medium-sized saucepan.  Cook over low  heat, stirring occasionally until thickened.  Cool.    Punch dough down; cover; let rest 10 minutes.  Roll to form an 18x12-inch  rectangle.  Brush with melted butter; spread with filling.  Starting with  long side, roll up as for jelly roll.  Form into circle on greased cooky  sheet, sealed edge down.  Make cuts 2/3 of way through ring at 1-inch  intervals.  Turn one section to left and next to right. Repeat around  ring. [Cut edges showing a spiral of filling will be exposed, and parallel  with the work surface. --K.M.]  Brush lightly with melted shortening.    Cover; let rise in warm place until nearly double in size, about 45  minutes.  Bake in preheated moderate oven (350 F.) 20 to 25 minutes.  Drizzle with confectioners sugar frosting while still warm.  Makes one  large tea ring.
