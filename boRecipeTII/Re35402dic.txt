Beef Dressing Casserole
milk, Worcestershire Sauce, Mushroom soup; (undiluted), Poultry seasoning, Onion, Celery leaves; minced, Prepared mustard, Dry bread; cut into 1/2 inch, Ground beef, 
Mix onion, celery leaves, poultry seasoning, and dried bread cubes. Add 1  can soup and milk. Cover and set in refrigerator overnight. Next day, mix  meat and mustard. Add bread mixture. Mix it thoroughly. Turn into a 13x9x2  inch pan. (I prefer Pyrex.) Pat it down. Spread 1 can of diluted soup on  top. Bake at 375 degrees for about 1 hour, or a little less. Cut this  casserole in squares and garnish with parsley.    Note: Cranberry salad is a delightful accompaniment.    Recipe by: Laura Lewis - Illinois    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #976 by "M.
