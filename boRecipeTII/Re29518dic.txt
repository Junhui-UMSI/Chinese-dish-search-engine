MAGAZINE (vegetarian and whole foods) web site  http://www.newhope.com/public/delicious >kitPATh    Notes: Yields 2 1/2 cups. This vinegar makes a delicious vinaigrette or  sauce after deglazing a vegetable or poultry roasting pan. When working  with herbs, dry them partially to prevent bacteria from growing in the  vinegar or oil. Simply place them in a warm oven for 5 to 10 minutes.  **PREP TIME: 10 minutes STEEPING TIME: 1 week    BOIL FIRST: I havent tried this method. Usually blanch the herb to purify.  Then heat vinegar to a boil. Pour boiling vinegar on the herb - and pour  into a clean bottle that will keep herb completely submerged. store in  refrigerator for about 4 days - swirling the bottle every now and then.  Strain, discard the herb and use the vinegar. -- pat    Recipe by: Delicious! 12/97    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by KitPATh <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on Apr 18,  1998
