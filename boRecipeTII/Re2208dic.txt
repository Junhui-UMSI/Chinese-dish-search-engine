Published in the Los Angeles Times on August 19, 1998, in an article  written by Marion Cunningham. Ms Cunningham writes "Bagna Cauda, which  means hot bath, is a classic sauce from Piedmont, Italy. It is usually kept  hot in a pot over a flame, but it can be presented at the table in a  serving dish or in individual small bowls without the flame....Raw  vegetables cut into bite-size pieces are speared on a long prong like fork  and held in the hot sauce for a few seconds...In Italy,the most common  vegetables eaten with Bagna Cauda are fennel, cauliflower, cabbage and  sweet peppers, but any vegetable that is good to eat raw will work  fine...."    1. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic  and cook, stirring, until slightly, softened but not browned, about 2  minutes.    2. Remove from heat and add remaining 1 1/4 cups olive oil, butter, and  anchovies.    3. Return pan to medium heat and stir to mix thoroughly. Taste and add salt  if needed (anchovies are salty).    4. Remove from heat and serve. (Sauce may be made ahead, refrigerated in  covered jar and reheated brefore serving.).
