The yogurt marinade in this dish locks in moisture and lends a  complementary spicy flavor. The duck is skinned before cooking to reduce  fat.    With a sharp knife or poultry shears, remove backbone and wing tips from  duck and cut the duck into 4 serving pieces. Cut away the skin and fat. In  a shallow, non aluminum dish, mix together yogurt, garlic, ginger, cumin,  paprika, 1 tsp. salt, cardamom and cayenne pepper.    Add the duck pieces, turning to coat well and marinate, covered, in the  refrigerator for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.    About 1/2 hour before serving, in a medium-sized saucepan, heat oil over  medium heat. Add onions and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until translucent  and lightly browned. Rinse lentils well and add them to the saucepan with  turmeric, remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, black pepper and 2 1/2 cups water. Bring  to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally,  for 15 to 20 minutes, or just until lentils are tender. Cover and set  aside.    Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the broiler. Remove the duck  from the marinade (reserve marinade) and grill on a lightly oiled rack or  broil on a rack set over a foil-lined baking sheet. Grill or broil for 5 to  7 minutes on one side, or until browned. Turn, baste once with reserved  marinade and discard marinade. Cook 8 to 10 minutes longer, or until juices  run clear when pierced with a fork. just before serving, briefly reheat the  lentils and serve with the duck.    451 CALORIES PER SERVING: 44 G PROTEIN, 15 G FAT, 35 G CARBOHYDRATE; 323 MG  SODIUM; 105 MG CHOLESTEROL.
