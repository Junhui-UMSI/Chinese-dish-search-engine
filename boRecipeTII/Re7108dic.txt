Poppy Seed Petal Loaf
Poppy Seeds, Butter, Buttermilk Biscuit Rolls;, Sesame seeds, 
1. Separate the 10 biscuits. Make 4 evenly spaced cuts in each, cutting to  within 1/2" in center; spread cuts slightly to resemble petals. Place, with  petals touching, in 2 rows on a cookie sheet.    2. Dip the ends of a wooden spoon handle into melted butter ; pressing into  center of each biscuit, then dip into poppy seeds and onto buttered center.  Repeat dipping in butter, then sesame seeds, to trim edges of petals. (This  trick makes it easy to add just enough seeds without scattering them.)    3. Bake in moderate oven 375 degrees for 20 minutes, or until golden. Serve  hot.
