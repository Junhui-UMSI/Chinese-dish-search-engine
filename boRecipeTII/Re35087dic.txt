Beards Beer Batter
Eggs, Beer, Salt, Flour, Vegetable oil, 
The ultimate batter for deep frying... DIRECTIONS:    BEER!  Whether its ale, lager, pilsener, or stout, is terrific for  cooking. Beer makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French onion  soup.  And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy Vancouver  weekend out on the boat fishing for Spring salmon than a cold beer with a  hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown beer mustard?    This is the late James Beards recipe for batter to French fry vegetables.  Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with flour, dip into the  batter, and fry in oil at 360 F. until done. However, James "missed the  boat" on this one - its far better for deep frying halibut, cod, or any  other seafood.  The batter puffs up because of the beers yeast, fries  quickly, and as a result, doesnt commit the cardinal sin of seafood  preparation - overcooking.  I think few of our piscine friends benefit from  deep frying as a cooking method, but thats another story.    To prepare, place flour in a mixing bowl and add egg yolks, salt, oil, and  beer.  Stir batter until thoroughly mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and  allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours or as long as 24 - the  longer the better, to a point. Just before using batter, stir it well  again.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry; gently  fold egg whites into batter.  Does 2 lbs. of veggies or 6 fish fillets,  depending upon their size.    Makes 4 servings.
