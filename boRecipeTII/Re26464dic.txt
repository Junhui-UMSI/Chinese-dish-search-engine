Tomato Meat Loaf
Condensed tomato soup, Oniion, peeled and sliced, Oregano, Salt, Basil, Ground beef, 
Place half of the onion slices in the bottom of a baking pan, 88x2; cover  with ground beef breaking it up lightly with a fork, But do not pack down.  Sprinkle with salt, basil, and oregano; top with remaining onion slices;  pour tomato soup over.    Bake in moderate oven (375f) 45 minutes or until brown.    Variation;    Double cheese loaf- place onion and ground beef in baking pan, following  directions above; spoon 1 cup (8-oz carton) cream style cottage cheese on  top, ten add seasonings and soup. Bake as above 30 minutes. Sprinkle with  1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese; bake 15 minutes longer    NOTES : I made this with all the onions on the bottom.  I think that I  might try adding some mushrooms next time. I also do not add the salt as  there is more than enough salt in the soup already.
