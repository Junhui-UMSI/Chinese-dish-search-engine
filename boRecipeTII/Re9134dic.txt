Heat olive oil in a large heavy enamellined casserole. Add peppers and  onions and saute for a minute to get them cooking. Reduce heat to low,  cover and simmer very gently until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.  Dont let olive oil get too hot or you will change the flavor. While these  are cooking, cut eggplant into 3/4inch chunks. When peppers and onions are  tender, add the garlic, eggplant, tomatoes and thyme and simmer over low  heat for 30 minutes.    While this is cooking cut zucchini and yellow squash lengthwise into halves  or quarters, depending on how thick they are. Remove seeds with a spoon,  then cut into 3/4 inch lengths. After 30 minutes of stewing eggplant, add  zucchini and squash to stew, cover and simmer, over very low heat until all  the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes ( you can simmer for another 30  to 40 minutes for more meltingly tender vegetables). Strain the stew  through a sieve and return juices back to casserole. Reduce the juices over  medium heat until they begin to sizzle in the olive oil. Return this to the  stew, season well to taste with salt and pepper. Divide ratatouille into  two portions to proceed.
