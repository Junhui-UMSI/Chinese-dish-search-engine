The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when  youre faced with yet another turkey to fix.  One is from the US, the  rest are from other parts of the world.  The Argentine Creole  Stuffing looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to  stuff and cook a turkey.    Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds  richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts  this stuffing out of the ordinary.    Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,  pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients  and mix well.
