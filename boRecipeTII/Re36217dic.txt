Beef Stroganoff From Samovar Restaurant and Bakery
All-purpose flour, Onion, Fresh dill, Fillet mignon, Mushroom caps, Whipping cream, Sour cream, Unsalted butter, Beef stock, Salt, Dijon mustard, Fresh parsley, 
1. Heat a large, heavy skillet preferably cast iron over high heat. Add the  meat a few pieces at a time, and quickly sear on all sides, stirring all  the time with a wooden spoon for 3 to 4 minutes. If the meat throws off too  much liquid, drain it off and set aside. Remove the meat from the skillet  and set aside.    2. Melt butter in a medium-size skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and  saute for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until softened. Increase  the heat to medium-high, then add the mushrooms and saute, stirring  frequently until they are deeply colored; this will take about 20 minutes.  Turn the heat down to medium-low. Sprinkle in the flour and cook for 1  minute, stirring all the while.    3. Stir in the stock, heavy cream, sour cream, mustard, and the meat  juices, if any. Simmer over low heat until the sauce thickens, about 5  minutes; do not allow to boil.    4. Return the meat to the skillet, stir to coat with the sauce, and heat  for 1 minute. Stir in the dill, parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve at once.  Number of servings not mentioned in article.    Recipe courtesy Samovar Restaurant & Bakery, Medford, Oregon.
