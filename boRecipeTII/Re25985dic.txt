Bacon on Toast with Cream Sauce
Toast, Cream sauce (use recipe for, Bacon; pan-fried or, 
This one is from New Hampshire. My lady friends there told me that they  had this for breakfast often as little girls. While I dont want you eating  bacon every morning, there is something to be said for a few slices of  old-fashioned cured New England bacon. A lot can be said!      The cream sauce can be made a day or two ahead and then warmed in the  microwave in no time.      Place the bacon on the toast and top with cream sauce. Then pour black  coffee and open the windows so that you can smell the fresh New Hampshire  air. (This works best if you are in New Hampshire!)    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
