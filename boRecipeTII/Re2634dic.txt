Peanut Brownie Torte
Sugar, Vanilla, Vanilla ice cream, Smooth peanut butter, Egg, Chopped unsalted dry roasted, ACCOMPANIMENT, Unsalted butter, All purpose flour, (6 ounces) semisweet, 
Butter and flour an 8-inch round cake pan. In a small metal bowl set over  barely simmering water melt 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips, peanut butter,  and the butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth. In a bowl, whisk  together the egg, sugar, and vanilla until the mixture is foamy, whisk in  the chocolate mixture and a pinch of salt, whisking until the mixture is  smooth, and fold in the flour, remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chops, and the  peanuts. Spoon the batter into the pan, spreading it evenly, and bake the  torte in the middle of a preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes to 20  minutes, or until a tester comes out with some crumbs adhering to it.  Transfer the torte to a rack, let it cool for 10 minutes, and serve it  warm, cut into wedges, with the ice cream.    Yield: one 8-inch torte    Notes: Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9083    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Apr 4, 1998
