The Ultimate Meat Loaf
Dried Crushed Rosemary, garlic, Ground pork, Worchestershire, Bacon, Tabasco sauce, Ground Beef Round, Stuffed green olives, Onion, Butter, Celery, Ketchup, Dijon mustard, Salt, Bulk Pork Sausage, Eggs, Breadcrumbs, Butter, Fresh Mushrooms, Dried thyme, Ground Veal, Green Pepper, 
Heat the 3 tablespoons of butter in a medium skillet, add the mushroom  stems and saute over moderate heat, stirring, about 5 minutes or till most  of their liquid has evaporated. Add the onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic,  thyme and rosemary, reduce heat, cover, and simmer about 15 minutes, till  vegetables are soft and liquid has evaporated. Preheat oven to 350. Place  the meats in a large mixing bowl, add the sauteed vegetables and mix  lightly. Add the mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire, Tabasco, salt and pepper  to taste, eggs and breadcrumbs, and mix with hands till blended thoroughly.  Shape the mixture into a firm, thick oval loaf, place in a shallow baking  or gratin dish, drape bacon over the top, and bake 1 hour. Remove the bacon  strips and continue baking 20 - 30 minutes longer, depending on how thick  the loaf is and how crusty you want the exterior to be. Shortly before the  meat loaf is removed from the oven, heat the 2 tablespoons of butter in a  small skillet, add the reserved mushroom caps and saute, stirring, 2  minutes or till nicely glazed. Transfer the meat loaf to a large serving  platter, arrange olives over the top and garnish the edges with the  mushroom caps.
