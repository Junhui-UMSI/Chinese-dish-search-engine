Watermelon Cookies
Red and green food coloring, Salt, Almond extract, All-purpose flour, Dried currants, Egg, Baking Powder, Sesame seeds, Butter or margarine, Sugar, 
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, sugar, egg and extract until light and  fluffy. Combine flour, salt and baking powder; stir into creamed mixture  and mix well. Remove 1 cup of dough; set aside. At low speed, beat in  enough red food coloring to tint dough deep red. Roll into a 3-1/2-in-long  tube; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.  Divide 1 cup of reserved dough into two pieces. To one piece, add enough  green food coloring to tint dough deep green. Do not tint remaining piece  of dough. Wrap each piece separately in plastic wrap; chill until firm,  about 1 hour. On a floured sheet of waxed paper, roll untinted dough into  an 8-1/2-in. x 3-1 12-in. rectangle. Place red dough along short end of  rectangle. Roll up and encircle red dough with untinted dough; set aside.  On floured waxed paper, roll the green dough into a 10-in. x 3-1/2-in,  rectangle. Place tube of red/untinted dough along the short end of green  dough. Roll up and encircle tube with green dough. Cover tightly with  plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Unwrap dough and  cut into 1/8-in, slices. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Lightly press dried currants and sesame seeds into each slice to resemble  watermelon seeds. Bake at 3750 for 6-8 minutes or until cookies are firm  but not brown. While still warm, cut each cookie in half or into pie-shaped  wedges. Remove to a wire rack to cool. Yield: 3 dozen.    NOTES : These cookies should resemble watermelon slices.  The outer layer  is green, like watermelon rind.  The next layer is white, similar to the  portion between the rind and the meat.  The last (and biggest) layer is the  watermelon.  Recipe by: Country Magazine June/July 1993    Posted to recipelu-digest by "Lynn Ratcliffe" <mcgrew@ntr.net> on Mar 28,  1998
