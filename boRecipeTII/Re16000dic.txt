To make crab cakes: Using a food processor fitted with a shredding/grating  disk, or a hand grater, grate apple into thin strips about 1 - 2" long.  Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet and saute apple strips 1 minute to remove  rawness. Combine with crab and green onions and set aside.    In a separate bowl, combine eggs, mayonnaise, parsley, Worcestershire  sauce, lemon peel, mustard, cayenne and salt. Blend well. With a fork, fold  egg mixture into the apple and crab.    In a blender, process bread into breadcrumbs. Add just enough bread crumbs  to apple/crab mixture to bind it. With your hands, form small patties; you  should have about 20. Place patties on a sheet of wax paper as you form  them.    Melt 2 Tbsp butter and 2 Tbsp of the oil in a large non-stick skillet.  Saute crabcakes until golden brown, about 2 - 3 minutes on each side.  Crabcakes will have to be sauteed in three separate batches, adding more  butter and oil to the skillet as necessary before each batch. Serve warm  with Toasted Pecan Tartar Sauce.    To make tartar sauce: Chop pecans in a blender or food processor. In a  small bowl, combine pecans with mayonnaise, vinegar, parsley, dry mustard,  lemon peel, salt and cornichons, if using. Blend well. Refrigerate until  used.    NOTES : * If bread is too fresh, dry out in a 200-degree oven for 15  minutes.
