*NOTE: Original recipe used 2 t vegetable oil AND 2 T butter    1. Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place flour  on sheet of waxed paper (I put the flour into a bowl). Dip chicken in flour  to coat both sides; shake off any excess flour and place chicken on another  piece of waxed paper (I just set them onto a platter).    2. Heat oven to 375F    3. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over med-high heat.    4. Add 6 chicken breast to skillet; saute until lightly browned, about 3  min per side. Place chicken in 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1" baking pan in single  layer. Repeat with remaining chicken.    5. Bake chicken in 375F oven for 20 min or until no longer pink in center.    6. Meanwhile, add garlic and prosciutto to skillet; cook over med heat,  stirring constantly, for 3 min. Add wine and rosemary; cook, stirring up  any browned bits from bottom of skillet, for 2 min.    7. Add tomatoes and broth. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat; simmer 10 min.    8. Place chicken on serving platter; pour sauce over top. Serve  immediately.    Make-Ahead Tip: In Step 5, bake chicken until just cooked through, about 15  min. Refrigerate immediately, covered. Refrigerate cooled sauce from Step  7, covered. To serve, reheat chicken in baking pan, uncovered, in 325F oven  for about 10 min. Gently reheat sauce in saucepan.    This was wonderful!! Definitely worth making.    NOTES : Cal 168.7, Fat 3.8g, Carb 7.7g, Fib 1.3g, Pro 25.1g, Sod 426mg, CFF  20.6%.
