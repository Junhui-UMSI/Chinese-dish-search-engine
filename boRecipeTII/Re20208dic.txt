Varieties of Olives

~-Cracked Green.  The Ubiquitous countryside olives, picked just before  their color changes from light to dark green.  Strong and sharp, they are  an ideal meze to serve with ouzo.  or marinate them for a few hours in  olive oil, a few drops of red-wine vinegar, bay leaves, a little crushed  coriander seed, and slivered garlic. --Ionian Green:Grown on the Ionian  islands, picked young, and cured in a light brine. Lovely mild, mellow  olives to serve just as they are.  Or sprinkle with lemon juice, olive oil,  and a little finely chopped preserved lemon and parsley. --Nafplion Olives:  Grown in the eastern Peloponnese and picked in September when young and  underripe.  Their mild and slightly nutty flavor is good in salads and  Nafplion is the traditional olive to serve with taramosalata.  ~-Occasionally I like to mix them with a little finely chopped preserved  lemon, olive oil and crushed coriander seeds. --Rosemary Barron recommends  Agoureleo Extra-Virgin(Peloponnese brand) olive oil. Among the less  expensive she suggest you look for greek olive oils made from Kalamata or  Amfissa olives.
