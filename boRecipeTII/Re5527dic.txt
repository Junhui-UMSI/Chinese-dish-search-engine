Ive been making this recipe since I was a teenager. It originally appeared  in that big, beautiful cookbook by Mary and Vincent Price.    I consider it somewhat closer to a coffee cake than to a standard fruit  bread. In any event, folks here have loved it. It can be mailed, and is  nice for Easter gifts. (You could make smaller loaves using mini loaf pans;  just make sure to bake it for less time.)    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    2. Butter two (1-pound) loaf pans.    3. Sift dry ingredients into large bowl.    4. Stir in macadamia nuts.    5. In mixing bowl, cream butter with brown sugar.    6. Add eggs; continue beating until mixture is smooth.    7. Stir in one-half of the flour-nut mixture.    8. Stir in crushed pineapple (including juice).    9. Add remaining flour-nut mixture, continuing to stir until it is  well-blended.    10. Pour batter into prepared pans.    11. Combine granulated sugar with cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over loaves.    12. Place pans in oven and bake until done (50 - 60 minutes).    13. Leave loaves in pan for 5 minutes, then invert onto wire rack to cool.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 13 Mar 97 by Teasel <teasel@JUNO.COM> on Mar 14,  1997
