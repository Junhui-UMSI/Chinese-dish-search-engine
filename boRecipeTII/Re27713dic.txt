Source: From my mother with love & more ????????????? Family recipe; Oma  Ruth Lessing.    There is 2 methods of preparing the dough. one. Is, Cream butter with the  sugar ,and then add all the? Ingredients. or. Two.- The way I do - Put all  the dry ingredients in the food processor, But the    Nuts. Mix once with the Pulse. Add the butter and Nuts, Mix all till  resemble crumbs. Add. the yolk,? Note: It should become a ball. If not,  Add? slowly some drops of cold water. Press? 3/4 of the dough in buttered 9  inch pie pan, Press and push? it out so that it covers the bottom and sides  of the pan. Spoon the jam, and spread it evenly over the bottom with a  spatula . Roll remaining dough between hands into snake, about 3/8 inch  thick. Cut into 9 inch long strips, and flatten them a little. Arrange in  crisscross over jam. Run a sharp knife around the pan to loosen the dough  that extends above the strips, and press it on top of the strips.?? Over  the strips brush the egg + cream with a pastry brush . Bake in pre heated  350 F hot oven for 45 - 50 minutes, or until it is lightly browned. Let the  Torte cool for 5 minutes and then sprinkle with icing sugar.
