Source: FOODday, July 9, 91 From: Valerie Whittle    This cinnamon-orange marinade, characteristic of Balkan cooking, is a  specialty of Georgia in south-central Russia. The tabaka marinade is  usually used with chicken and game hen, but it also goes nicely with  swordfish.    Remove zest of 1 orange and the lemon.  (This is best done using a  vegetable peeler.  Be sure to take only the zest, not bitter white pith  beneath it.)  Juice oranges, lemon and limes. Combine juice and zest in  bowl. Peel and mince garlic and ginger root. Finely chop onion. Add garlic,  ginger and onion to citrus juices along with cinnamon, paprika, sugar,  salt, black pepper, nutmeg, wine and oil. Whisk to mix. Makes enough  marinade for 1 1/2 pounds chicken, game hens and swordfish.
