Venison Chops with Dried Cranberries
Port, 6-ounce venison chops, Unsalted butter, olive oil, Demi glace, Pot of soft polenta, Dried cranberries, Salt and pepper, Grated Parmesan cheese, Chopped shallots, Chopped parsley, 
In a bowl soak the cranberries in the port for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat  the oil in a saute pan. Season the venison chops with salt and pepper on  both sides. Place chops into the saute pan and sear them on both sides for  3 minutes. Remove and set aside. Place the shallots in the same pan and  cook for 1 minute. Drain the port from the cranberries, and carefully add  it to the pan. It will ignite. When the fire dies, add the demi glace as  well as the venison, and the cranberries. Cook for 2 minutes flipping the  chops once. Swirl in the butter and season. Serve with polenta, parsley,  and cheese.
