Apply the pepper evenly over the ribs, and then do the same with the dry  rub. Place the slabs in a plastic trash bag, and put them in the  refrigerator overnight.    The next day mix the mop sauce and prepare the pit for smoking. Cook the  slabs between 200 degrees and 220 degrees until you feel them crack a bit  between the ribs when you bend the slabs with a gloved hand, approximately  3 1/2 to 4 hours. Every 30 minutes baste both sides and turn them over.  Allow the slabs to sit 10 minutes before slicing them into individual ribs.
