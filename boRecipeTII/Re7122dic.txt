Poppy-Seed Candy
Pecans, Sugar, Honey, Powdered ginger, Poppy seeds, 
Have the poppy seeds ground for you when you buy them. If this is not  possible, grind them in a food chopper or pound with a mortar and pestle.    Cook together the honey and sugar until syrupy. Stir in the poppy seeds and  cook until the mixture is thick, about 20 minutes. Stir frequently. (Drop a  little on a wet surface; if it doesnt run, it is thick enough.) Stir in  the nuts and ginger.    Moisten hands; pat out mixture onot wet board to thickness of about 1/2  inch.  Let cool 5 minutes, then cut into diamonds or squares with a sharp  knife.  When knife sticks, dip into hot water. Cool completely and lift  from board with a spatula.    From: The Art of Jewish Cooking, by Jennie Grossinger Shared By: Pat  Stockett
