Aunt Jeannes Corn Fritters
Eggs, Flour, Cream-style corn, Baking powder, Salt, White pepper, 
I promised more of Aunt Jeannes recipes too long ago. Ive been serving  this lately and everyone wants the recipe. It is important to note there is  no cream in "cream-style corn". Delicious topped with a bit of yogurt or  sour cream and a "pinch" of caviar with chopped chives.Makes about 40 small  pancakes which are easily reheated for 5-10minutes if made ahead.    Combine; mix until smooth & drop by spoon into 1/8" cooking oil    I tend to thin this down somewhat either with milk for dairy or broth for  meat when using as a vegetable rather than an appetizer.
