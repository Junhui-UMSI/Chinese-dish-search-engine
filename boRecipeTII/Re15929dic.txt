Transfer to a saucepan, bring to a boil over  medium heat, stirring once or twice to prevent scorching, and cover the  pan. Reduce heat to a low and simmer for 10 minutes, The sauce is done when  the raw tomato and red chili taste are gone. Once cooled, it will be about  as thick as ketchup, suitable to use as a thick meat marinade or to moisten  fillings that need to remain fairly stiff, such as tamales.    FOR ENCHILADA SAUCE.
