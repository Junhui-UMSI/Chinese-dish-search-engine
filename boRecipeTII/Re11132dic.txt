Raisin Bread with Fruit Pulp
Raisin Bread recipe, Cinnamon, Pulp, Reduce the liquid in recipe, 
I have a 1 1/2 pound Welbilt and I make a moist dark bread using carrot  pulp saved from my juicer (can you tell I like gadgets?). To a standard  raisin bread recipe I add 1 cup of pulp and reduce the water in the recipe  by 1/2 cup. I like a tsp of cinnamon in this, too. Since the moisture  content of juicer pulp can vary, my failsafe for the water  is to start the  machine with everything added but the raisins, but with only about half the  water I expect to use. Then after a few minutes of  mixing I drizzle water  in SLOWLY till the dough forms a smooth,  slightly sticky ball. Too sticky  and the bread tends to fall. Too dry and the bread is a bit too dense and  dry. Have fun!  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Helen Fleischer helen@mbbs.com
