Mix the dry ingredients together in a  larger bowl, then mix in the wets with the drys. Pour into an 8 x 8 inch  pan and bake at 350 for about 30-35 minsutes, or until the top springs back  when touched.    Note: This is a recipe from the vita-mix cookbook that originally called  for oil, but I use my own home-made applesauce. I buy bags of apples when  they are cheap and just cut them in fourths (cut out the seeds and stem)  and fill up the crockpot with them. I then just put a few dashes of  cinnamon on them (no liquid) then cover and stew on low all day. When they  are mushy I just transfer it to the vita-mix (a blender is just as good I  suppose) and let it rip for a few seconds. Voila.....heavenly smell in the  house all day while it stews, plus incredibly delicious (and inexpensive)  applesauce after its done! I pour the applesauce into pint size jars and  freeze them until needed.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #154    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
