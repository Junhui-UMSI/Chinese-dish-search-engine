Thunder and Lightning
Garlic cloves, crushed, olive oil, Dry chick peas, soaked, Parsley, elbow macaroni, Basil, Olive oil for drizzling, 
Drain & wash chick peas.  Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, or until tender.    Meanwhile, cook the macaroni in a large pan of boiling water, lightly  salted for 10 minutes, or until just resistant to the bite. Drain.    Saute garlic in a large skillet in olive oil for a few minutes. Add cooked,  drained chick peas & macaroni. Mix in the basil & parsley. Cook over a very  low heat, stirring occasionally, til the flavours are absorbed & the  mixture is heated through.  Season with salt & pepper & serve hot with a  crisp green salad.
