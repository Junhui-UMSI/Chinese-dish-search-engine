Tomatillo-Serrano Salsa
Tomatillos, Lime juice, fresh, Serrano chiles, Sugar, Water, Avocado, Salt, Cilantro, fresh leaves,, 
Pulse the tomatillos, serranos, sugar, cilantro, salt, and 1/2 cup water in  a blender until smooth. Add the lime juice, avocado, and the remaining 1/2  cup water and pulse again until the salsa is smooth and even-colored, but  not pureed.    Serving suggestions: This classic salsa verde (green salsa) is an excellent  all-purpose salsa. Serve it cold or at room temperature. Goes well with  fish and seafood.    Storage: Can be stored in the refrigerator up to 2 days, but the longer it  is held, the more it loses its bright green color.    Prep time: 30 minutes Yield: about 3 cups    Adapted for MasterCook by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com>    Recipe by: Coyotes Pantry by Miller and Kiffen Posted to EAT-L Digest 18  Mar 97 by lunchuck <jock@THIRD-WAVE.COM> on Mar 19, 1997
