1. Mix together eggs, cream, seasonings, parsley & cheese. Dip the veal  pieces into the batter & then into the bread crumbs. Shake off the excess.    2. Heat olive oil & butter in a large frying pan until hot.    3. Saute veal until crisp on both sides. Remove from skillet, add the flour  to the pan drippings, enough to form a smooth paste, & stir until smooth.  Pour in the sherry, Marsala, lemon juice & chicken broth. Bring to a boil.  Season with salt & pepper.    4. Strain over cooked veal. Top each piece  of veal with a piece of  prosciutto ham & a thin slice of lemon. Serve. Note: Make sure the fat in  the skillet is quite hot before you add the breaded pieces of veal,  otherwise the crumbs will absorb the fat.
