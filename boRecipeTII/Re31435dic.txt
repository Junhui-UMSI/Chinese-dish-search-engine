Sick and tired of thick hickory flavored tomato based BBQ sauce?  Here is  something new and DELICIOUS!!     Mix all of this together in a large mixing bowl.     You can marinate fish or chicken in it for at least 1 hour and then throw  it on the BBQ -- I guarantee that you will love it!!!!     Angel Hair Pasta with a touch of butter, tomato and onion salad, corn and  or a nice mixed green salad makes a great side dish!  Have a great weekend  ~-STAY OUT OF THE HEAT!!!!
