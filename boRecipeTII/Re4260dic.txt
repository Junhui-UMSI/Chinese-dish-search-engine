Cut out the stalk, scoop out the seeds,  leaving the pepper intact. Crush the feta cheese with a fork, add 1-2  beatten eggs, some black pepper , then fill the peppers with about 2-3 Tsp  of the mixture. Dip the peppers into flour, one at a time, and shake to  remove excess of flour. Turn them in a plate with beatten eggs and fry in  hot oil until evenly brown. Drain on a clean kitchen cloth. Serve hot, or  cold. Can be re-heated in an oven before serving as an appetizer or light  dinner.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Judith Sobel <jcs@mindspring.com> on May  11, 1998
