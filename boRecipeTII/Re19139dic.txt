Hello, Grilling Enthusiasts!    It used to be that the only vegetables anyone ever grilled outdoors were  onions and bell peppers wedged between chunks of meat on the ubiquitous  "shish kebab." But no more! Grilled vegetables have come into their own,  finding their way into almost every meal and many menus in some of the  finest restaurants.    Turn your backyard into a five-star restaurant and prepare this tasty  vegetable kebab tonight, as The Cook and Kitchen Staff head outside and get  grilling!    Prepare grill to medium heat. Soak skewers in water prior to preparing  kebabs.    Make four kebabs by threading the vegetables onto eight wooden skewers  (using them in pairs to hold the pieces more securely). Alternate peppers,  mushrooms, tomatoes, and zucchini (or summer squash) on each set of  skewers.    Brush the kebabs all over with olive oil. Grill, turning once or twice,  until the vegetables are cooked, just about 6 to 8 minutes total. Serve  warm or at room temperature with parsley sauce.    To prepare sauce, place all ingredients in a blender or the bowl of a food  processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse or process until parsley and  cilantro are finely minced and all ingredients are thoroughly combined.    Kitchen Staff Tips: The Parsley Sauce can also be used as a dip. If  desired, you can substitute reduced-fat sour cream or plain yogurt for the  mayonnaise. The double-skewer technique keeps vegetables secure. Simply  thread the pieces on two skewers held parallel to each other to keep from  losing vegetables to breakage on the grill.
