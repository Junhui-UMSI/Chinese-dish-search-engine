Bbq Chicken Marinade - Sbkk78a
Pepper, Good Sherry, Garlic, Mixed Herbs, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Dry vermouth, Dijon mustard, Onion, Soy sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, 
Mix all ingredients in deep dish or bowl..*** Amontillado sherry is best  for this.. remember use only good sherry... not over salted cooking  sherry.. if you cant drink it you shouldnt cook with it. This is enough for  about 2 lb chicken which should marinate in this for several hours before  it goes to the grill.. this can also be used as basting sauce but watch out  for flare ups of oil on hot coals...
