"Baking the Best Muffins"
TIPS, 
* measure ingredients carefully and mix just enough to moisten. Dont worry  if the batter still has a few lumps. Overbeating can make muffins tough.    * If you dont have a nonstick muffin pan, a spritz of nonstick cooking  spray in the pan or on the papers before filing them will prevent these  reduced-fat muffins from sticking after theyre baked. Remove the papers  while the muffins are still warm.    * Muffins are best warm from the oven. Reheat any leftovers briefly in the  microwave.
