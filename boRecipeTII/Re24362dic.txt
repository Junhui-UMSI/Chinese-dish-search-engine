Rinse a 10- to 12-cup fluted tube pan or ring mold with cold water.    Orange Layer:  Place orange gelatin in a medium metal bowl.  Add boiling  water and stir until completely dissolved. Stir in ice water and orange  peel.  Half-fill a large bowl with ice cubes and cold water.  Place bowl with  gelatin in the ice bath. Stir gelatin occasionally with a rubber spatula  until mixture is thick as unbeaten egg whites. Remove bowl of gelatin, fold  in orange segments and pour into mold, distributing oranges evenly. Put  mold in freezer until gelatin sets, about 10 minutes.  Cranberry Layer:  Using cranberry gelatin, proceed as directed above,  omitting orange peel and adding bananas in place of orange segments. Pour  evenly over orange layer. Return to freezer until set, about 10 minutes.  Creamy Lemon Layer:  Place lemon gelatin in a medium metal bowl.  Add  boiling water and stir until completely dissolved.  In another bowl, whisk cream cheese, sugar and lemon peel until smooth.  Whisk into lemon gelatin until well blended. Cool mixture as directed  above. When gelatin has thickened, fold in pears. Pour evenly over  cranberry layer and refrigerate at least 4 hours until very firm or up to 2  days.  To unmold:  Dip mold up to rim into warm (not hot) water about 10 seconds.  Invert plate over mold.  INvert mold and plate together, shaking both  gently from side to side to release gelatin.
