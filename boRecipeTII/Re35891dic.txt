Stuffed Maine Lobster
Diced onion, Cracker meal, (20-oz) Maine lobsters, Celery, Sherry, Crab meat, Mayonnaise, Diced Bay shrimp, Cubed scallops, Salt & ground black pepper, Butter, MSG, 
Preheat oven to 350. Immerse lobsters in boiling salted water for 5-7 mins.  & let cool in the same water. While theyre cooling, saute celery, onion,  scallops, shrimp & crab meat in butter. Season to taste w/ salt & pepper.  Add MSG & sherry. Strain mixture to release excess liquid. While this  mixture is draining, if lobsters have cooled sufficiently, place them belly  side up on a cutting board. Cut them down the middle w/ a sharp knife &  open them flat, leaving the meat intact. Remove the stuffing mixture from  the strainer to a bowl. Add the mayonnaise & stir gently until well mixed.  Mound filling on each lobster shell. Sprinkle cracker meal over the tops.  Bake 5-7 minutes in preheated oven until golden brown.
