Apple Butter/oven
Apple cider, Spices:, Allspice, Ground cloves, Nutmeg, Brown sugar, Cinnamon, Unsweetened applesauce, Granulated sugar, 
The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier  texture thats best for applesauce.     Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and cook in a slow oven(325  deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.     Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple butterrequires    long, slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #148 by novmom@juno.com (Angela Gilliland)  on May 28, 1997
