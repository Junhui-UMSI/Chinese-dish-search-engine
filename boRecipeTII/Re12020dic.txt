ZIGNI WET could I guess be called an Ethiopian "Sloppy Joe".  Dont worry  if you cant find bishops weed.  Add a little crushed mint instead.    Fry onions WITHOUT grease in a pan until they are brown.  Add berbere or  awaze and water and stir.  Add niter kebbeh.  Sprinkle ground beef into the  pan while stirring.  Add spices and let the stew cook until the meat is  done.  Serve hot.  Store in refrigerator.    >From "Exotic Ethiopian Cooking" by D.J.
