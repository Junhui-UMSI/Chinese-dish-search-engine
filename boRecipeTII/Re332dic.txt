Lemon Bars
Flour, Powdered sugar, Butter, Eggs, Sugar, Lemon juice, 
Mix the flour, powdered sugar and butter with a pastry blender and pat into  an 8" square pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Then mix the eggs,  sugar, and lemon juice and add to the previous part. Return to the oven and  bake for 25 minutes more. Sprinkle with powered sugar and cut into square.  Makes 16 squares.    I usually double the recipe and put into a 9x13" pan.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Phyllis Braun <pbraun@IDIR.NET> on Dec 8, 1997
