Vegetable Bread Roll-Up
French bread dough, Vegetables, chopped, such as, Onion, Fat-free Parmesan cheese, 
I saw this recipe on TV, demonstrated by a woman who does Heart Smart in  Detroit. Its easy and delicious.    Saute onions and mushrooms in a bit of water until soft, adding other  veggies and cooking until relatively soft. Unroll package of fresh bread  dough and spread veggies evenly over all. Top with Parmesan. Roll up  carefully and place seam-side down on cooking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees  for 25 minutes, until top is lightly browned. If top gets too brown, cover  with aluminum foil for balance of baking time. Posted to fatfree digest V97  #037 by msillars@rmi.net (Mal Sillars) on Mar 25, 1997
