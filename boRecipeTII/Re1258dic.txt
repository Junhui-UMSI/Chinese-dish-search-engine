Saute the onions until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the water and  blend in the curry paste and coconut. Stir in the tofu, making sure it all  gets coated with the curry sauce. Stir in the tomatoes.    Cover and cook over medium heat until the tomatoes are soft, about 5  minutes. If the mixture seems quite dry, stir in 1/4 cup water. ADd the  spinach. Cover and continue cooking until the spinach is tender, 2-3  minutes. Add salt and the cilantro, if you like.    Serve the curry in bowls over steamed basmati rice, with your favorite  sweet mango chutney on the side.
