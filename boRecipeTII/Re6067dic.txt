Makes enough dough for 2-14" pizzas with a thin-ish crust.    I find that instead of cornmeal under the pizza, I like to lightly spray  the pan with olive oil spray.  I know this isnt traditional, but it gives  a crispier crust that stick less than when I use cornmeal.    This is a double recipe and it fits fine in my Zo.  I freeze half the  dough....see below about how I prep it for freezing and make a package that  is easy to store and very fast to use.  Since I roll it out before  freezing, I dont have to mess up my counter a second time before I bake  it.    Combine in order your bread machine likes and process on dough setting.  When done, divide dough in half.  Roll and use one half.    For the half to be frozen: roll out to the size you would like to use.  Cover with a sheet (or two in not wide enough) of plastic wrap.  Starting  at one end, loosely roll up the dough with the wrap on top (this allows  there to be wrap between each layer of dough). When done, wrap in a plastic  bag or antoher layer of wrap. Freeze flat.    To use: remove from freezer and when the dough is just about defrosted,  unfurl it out on a lightly oiled pan, keep it covered with the plastic wrap  that was frozen with it and allow to defrost and rise slightly before  adding toppings.    best-debbie bier concord, ma >From: bzwax@tiac.net (rich)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Sandra L.
