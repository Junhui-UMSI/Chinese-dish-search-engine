Truffle Pizza
Freshly-ground white pepper;, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Salt, Julienned red onions, Drizzle of truffle oil, Grated Parmigiano-Regginao, Warm water; (110 degrees), olive oil, Yeast, Flour -; (to 4 cups), New potatoes; thinly sliced,, Salt, Chives, 
Preheat the oven 400 degrees.    In an electric mixer, whisk the yeast, water, and oil, together, to form a  paste. Using a dough hook, add the flour and salt to the paste, mix the  dough until the dough comes away from the sides and crawls up the sides of  the hook. Remove the dough from the bowl and turn the dough into a greased  bowl, cover. Let the dough rise until double in size, about 1 hour.    Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into four 4-ounce  balls, cover. Let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press each dough out  into a 10-inch circle about 1/2- to 1-inch thick. Lightly brush the dough  with olive oil. Divide the potatoes into four portions and season with salt  and pepper. Cover each dough with the potatoes, leaving a 1-inch border.    In a small mixing bowl, toss the red onions with the extra-virgin olive  oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place a layer of the red onions on top of  the potatoes. Sprinkle each pizza with the grated cheese. Drizzle each  pizza with the truffle oil. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the crust is  crispy and golden-brown. Garnish the pizza with chives.    This recipe yields four 10-inch pizzas.
