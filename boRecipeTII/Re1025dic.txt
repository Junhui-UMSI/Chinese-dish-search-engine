Heres a pareve Rugelach recipe from "Spice and Spirit"    In a small bowl dissolve yeast in warm water, let stand until bubbly.    In a 1 1/2 quart sauce pan, melt margarine. In a separate bowl, beat eggs.  Stir in flour and sugar. Add melted margarine and yeast and mix until dough  is formed. Cover vowl and refrigerate overnight.    Remove dough from refrigerator and divide into four equal parts. Roll each  part out into a circle, spread with filling and cut into triangles, like  cutting a pizza. Roll each triangle from the wide part in.    Preheat oven to 350F. Bake for 15 minutes until lightly browned.    Ive made these and they come out yummy. I like a chocolate filling even  better. ( I just mix cocoa generously with sugar and sprinkle it over the  dough).    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Linda Shapiro <lss@coconet.com> on Dec 01,  1998,
