Yeast Rolls
Yeast, Oil (or 1 1/2# butter and 1, All Purpose Flour (or 1/2, Dry Milk, Salt, Water (70 ndegrees tap, Sugar, Plus, 
Mix all dry ingredients together about 1 minute on low speed of mixer. Add  oil and water. Mix 10 minutes on Medium speed. Just before removing dough  from bowl pour about 1/4 cup oil around side of bowl while mixing. This  makes it easier to remove dough from bowl. Pour 1/4 cup oil on table and  spread around. Take dough out of mixer and place on oiled table. Weigh out  5 1/2 # pieces of dough and place each piece on a greased bun pan. Place in  proofer at no more then 90 degrees or in warm place. When dough has doubled  in size, punch down and let rest 5 minutes. Roll dough out in bun pans, cut  7x10, place back in proofer and let rise. Bake 350 degrees about 10  minutes.    This recipe makes 210 rolls this way. You can also use an ice cream scoop  and make them individually. When you weigh out the 5 1/2 # pieces you can  refrigerate the dough for a few days. Also if you want to make the whole  recipe the rolls can be baked off and frozen. They are delicious when  defrosted and warmed in a microwave.    Hope this helps or at least brings back warm memories from the 60s.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 31 Aug 96    From:    Ruth L Rivera <riverar@JUNO.COM>    Date:    Sun, 1 Sep 1996 22:45:15 EDT
