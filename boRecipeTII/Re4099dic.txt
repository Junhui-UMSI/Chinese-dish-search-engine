Pepperoni Pizza Casserole
Green pepper, sliced mushrooms, Rice, Mozarella, Garlic powder, pepperoni, Oregano, Eggs, Ragu spaghetti, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
1. Combine rice, eggs, parmesan cheese, oregano, and garlic powder. Mix  well. Spread into a well-greased 9x13x2 baking pan. (Or two smaller pans.)  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, or until firm.    2. Spread spaghetti sauce over rice. Top evenly with pepperoni, mushrooms,  and pepper rings. Sprinkle mozarella cheese over the top. Bake for 15  minutes or until hot and bubbly.    3. Cut into squares to serve.    Note: This is sort of like a casserole with the taste of a pepperoni pizza.  It is really quick and easy to prepare.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H. Frye" <shfrye@PEN.K12.VA.US> on Sep  7, 1997
