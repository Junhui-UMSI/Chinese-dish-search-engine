Also, I would be remiss if I didnt post my grandchildrens favorite recipe  of mine adapted from a 1962 Plainfield N.J. Section of National Council of  Jewish Women Cookbook:    Saute vegetables in minimum amount of fat (or in broth in microwave)until  tender. Meantime cook egg barley as directed. When vegetables are tender  add the chicken broth and let simmer a few minutes. Add cooked farfel, salt  and pepper. Mixture should be loose. Place in greased baking dish. Bake 1/2  hour, covered at 350 degrees.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Marilyn Jacobs <jacobsma@pacbell.net> on  Sep 26, 1998,
