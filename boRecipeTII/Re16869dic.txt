All-Purpose Barbecue Rub
Cayenne pepper powder, Chile powder; (mild), Ground cloves, Paprika, Black Pepper, Ground cumin, 
Mix all ingredients in small bowl.    Makes 1 cup.    This rub, adapted from Big Flavors of the Hot Sun (Morrow, 1994), is a  little sweet, a little hot, with just a hint of clove. It can be used on    just about anything that you plan to barbecue, that is, to cook over low,  indirect heat for a long period of time. For large red-meat roasts, such    as leg of lamb or standing rib, increase the cayenne pepper from one  teaspoon to one tablespoon and substitute one teaspoon cinnamon for the  ground cloves.
