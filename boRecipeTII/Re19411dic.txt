Well, a few days ago (funny how synchronicity works, isn't it?) my mother passed along the following recipe, adapted from a WWII-era recipe for meatless sausage.     Mix all ingredients well and form into four patties.  Brown in a non-stick skillet (this has a tendency to stick, so you might want to use a *light* spray of non-stick cooking spray).  To the skillet add 3 cups of vegetable stock, or 3 cups of water mixed with a veggie boullion cube.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove patties from liquid, and re-brown before serving (they should be very dark brown and a  little crispy on the outside). The leftover liquid can be thickened with a little flour to make a nice gravy to pour over the "sausage".   The trick to  this recipe is to make the patties properly. If you pack them too tightly, the middles will become glutinous; if they are not packed tightly enough they will fall apart. Doubling the recipe works well. If you're not going to use the patties right away, do not re-brown after boiling; save the re-browning for just before serving. They will keep several days in the  refrigerator.
