First Layer: Beat cream cheese until lumps are gone, then add sugar and mix  well. Add melted chocolate chips, then cookies. Mix in eggs and vanilla.  Pour into pan and place in freezer to firm up. Second Layer: Beat cream  cheese until lumps are gone. Add sugar, chocolate chips, then sour cream.  When smooth, finish with eggs and extracts. Pour second layer on top of  (hopefully) firm first layer. Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours, until  top feels jiggly but firm. Cool, refrigerate. Topping: Melt chocolate  chips, whisk in cream and peppermint. While topping is still runny, spread  over whole cake and decorate with cookies. Accent with green icing around  cookies. Keep chilled.
