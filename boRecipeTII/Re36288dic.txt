Lift cover once to stir ingredients. Add beef back  into wok. Mix everything together well. Serve    NOTE: A corn starch gravy may be added to the above recipe if desired.  Chicken or pork can be used in place of beef, they can be retained in  wok while asparagus and celery are cooking in it. It is suggested  that the asparagus be cut diagonally as it requires a fair amount of  cooking time.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cc-wok.zip
