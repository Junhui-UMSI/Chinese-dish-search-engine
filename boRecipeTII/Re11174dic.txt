Sift flour, sugar, salt and baking powder together. cut in shortening until  mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Mix in raisin and then add enough milk  to make as fairly soft but manageable dough. Roll out dough on a lightly  floured surface to form an 8-inch round. Divid it into half, if desired.  The scone is best cook as soon as the dough is made. Dividing the dough  will make it easier to turn it in the skillet. Heat 1 tbsp. of shortening  in a large, heavy skillet. Put dough into skillet and cook over low heat  for 10-15 minutes until the dough has risen. It should be cooked more than  halfway through and be well browned underneath. Lift up the scones and add  more shortening to skillet, allowing it to melt and coat the bottom. Turn  scone over then gently lower it back into the skillet. Cook the scone over  low heat for 10 minutes, or until brown on the underside. Check during  cooking and reduce heat, if necessary, to prevent it from overbrowning.  While it is hot, cut the scones across into halves and spread with.  Sandwich the halves back together and cut the scones into 8 wedges. Serve  them immediately. Serving Ideas: The hot scones are tasty when spread with  a cinnamon butter. To make the cinnamon butter: mix 1/2 cup butter and 3  tbsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.
