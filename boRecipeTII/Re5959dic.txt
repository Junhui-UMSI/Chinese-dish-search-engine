Pistachio Rosewater Turkish Delight
Shelled natural pistachios, Red food coloring if desired, Cold water, Granulated sugar, Cornstarch, Rosewater, (1/4-oz) unflavored gelatin, 
This little sweetmeat is very popular throughout the Middle East. The  Turkish term for the confection, rahat lokum, literally means "throats  ease."    Oil an 8-inch square baking pan and line with plastic wrap. Oil plastic  wrap.    In a small saucepan of boiling water blanch pistachios 3 minutes and drain  in a sieve. Rinse pistachios under cold running water and pat dry. Rub  skins off pistachios.    In a small bowl sprinkle gelatin over 1/2 cup cold water and let soften.    In another small bowl stir together 1/8 cup cold water and cornstarch.    In a 4-quart heavy kettle stir together remaining 1 1/2 cups cold water,    granulated sugar, and rosewater and bring to a boil over moderate heat,  stirring until sugar is dissolved. Stir in gelatin and cornstarch mixtures  and boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula, 10  minutes (mixture will be very thick). Stir in pistachios and food coloring  and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Pour mixture into baking pan, smoothing top  with spatula, and cool. Chill confection, loosely covered, until set, about        4    hours.    Sift 1 tablespoon confectioners sugar onto a work surface. Invert  confection onto sugar and peel off plastic wrap. Cut confection into  1/8-inch cubes. Sift remaining confectioners sugar over cubes and toss to  coat. Wrap cubes in parchment paper (do not use wax paper, plastic wrap, or  airtight containers because confections will weep) and chill. Turkish  delight may be made 2 weeks ahead and kept chilled, wrapped in parchment  paper.    Just before serving, recoat Turkish delight in additional confectioners  sugar.
