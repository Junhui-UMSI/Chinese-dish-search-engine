Peel and cut the shallots lengthwise or crosswise into thin slices. Set  aside. In a small, non-aluminum saucepan, combine the vinegar, sugar,  water, peppercorns, mustard seed, bay leaf and thyme. Bring to a boil over  high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove  from heat and cool.    Using a slotted spoon, pack the shallots into clean, dry jars with lids.  Ladle in the vinegar mixture, dividing the spices and herbs as evenly among  the jars as possible. Attach lids. Store the shallots in the refrigerator  at least a week before using. Will keep for several months.    Source: Medford Mail Tribune Posted by Katherine Smith Kook-Net: The Shadow  Zone IV - Stinson Beach, CA
