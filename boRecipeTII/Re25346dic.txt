The easiest way  to do this is to place a piece of foil in the toaster-oven tray and lay  halves on foil. Roast at 450 F. turning as necessary until soft and skin is  browned. Put in paper bag and shake to remove skin.  Recipe by: Ragu Website    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by J Pellegrino <gigimfg@ix.netcom.com> on May  26, 1998
