Banana Souffle
Eggs, Vanilla extract, Fresh raspberry puree, bananas, Fresh Lemon Juice, cream of tartar, Poire William, Garnish, sugar, 
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray four 1 1/2 cup souffle dishes with  nonstick cooking spray.    In a food processor, puree the bananas with the lemon juice, Poire William  and vanilla until smooth. Add the egg yolks and 1 teaspoon of the sugar;  process to blend thoroughly. Scrape the banana base into a medium bowl.    In a mixer bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar at high speed  until stiff peaks form. With the mixer on, sprinkle on the remaining 3  tablespoons sugar and continue beating until the whites are glossy. Fold  the egg whites into the banana base.    Spoon into the prepared dishes; the mixture will mount to the top. Run your  thumb around the inside rims to form a 1/4-inch groove in the mixture; this  will help the souffles rise evenly.    Set the dishes on a baking sheet and bake for 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to  425 degrees and bake for 7 minutes longer, or until puffed and browned.  Spoon a little raspberry sauce on top and serve immediately.
