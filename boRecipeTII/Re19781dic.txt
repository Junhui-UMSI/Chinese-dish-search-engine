In a medium saucepan, combine the 3/4 cup water, oil, lemon juice, sugar  and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the carrots. Cover the  pan and lower the heat. Simmer the carrots for 3 minutes. Then gently stir  in the celeriac so that all the pieces are coated with the sauce. Cover the  pan and simmer the vegetables together for about 10-12 minutes longer, or  until they are just tender. If a thicker sauce is desired, combine the  potato starch and cold water until well combined and stir the paste into  the hot sauce. Continue to heat and stir the vegetables until the sauce  thickens and simmers. Remove from the heat, serve hot, at room temperature  or chilled.
