Canned chipotle chilies are available at Latin American markets, specialty  foods stores and some supermarkets.    Saute beef and 2 cups chopped onions in large Dutch oven over high heat  until beef is cooked through, stirring often and breaking up beef with back  of spoon, about 10 minutes. Add cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and  chipotle chilies; saute 3 minutes. Mix in 2 1/2 cups water and 1/2 cup  cilantro. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover partially and cook 1 1/2 hours,  adding more water by 1/4 cupfuls if chili becomes dry. Season with salt and  pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; chill. Bring to simmer before  continuing.)    Mix remaining 1/2 cup cilantro into chili. Ladle chili into bowls. Serve,  passing cheese, sour cream and additional chopped onion separately. 4  Servings    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #294    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
