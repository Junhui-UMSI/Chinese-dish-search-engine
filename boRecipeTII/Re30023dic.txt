Stack 10 sheets phyllo on a flat surface, keeping remainder covered  with a dry, then a damp tea towel.        Brush top sheet of stack with butter, lift sheet and replace on stack  buttered side down.  Brush top with butter, lift top two sheets and turn  over on stack.  Repeat until all 10 sheets are buttered, lifting an extra  sheet each time.  Top and bottom of finished stack should remain  unbuttered.        With kitchen scissors cut buttered stack of phyllo into approximately  10 cm (4 inches) squares.  Stack and cover.  Prepare remainder of phyllo.  Depending on size of phyllo sheets, you may have fewer than 10 left at the  end.  Halve sheets if necessary to give 10 layers.        Beat egg whites until stiff and beat sugar in gradually.  Fold in nuts  and rose water.        Butter top of phyllo square and place a tablespoonful of nut mixture in  the centre.  Gently squeeze into a lily shape, with four corners of square  as petals and filling in centre.        Place in a buttered 25 x 33 cm (10 x 13 inch) baking dish. Repeat with  remaining ingredients, placing finished pastries close together in dish.        Bake in moderate oven for 30 minutes, reduce to slow and cook for  further 15 minutes.        Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and orange  water and bring to the boil.  Boil for 15 minutes, stir in rose water and  cool.        Spoon cool thick syrup over hot pastries.  Leave until cool and  sprinkle pistachio nuts in centres of pastries if desired.        Note: If you are not used to working with phyllo pastry, then it is  advisable to fill and shape the first lot of buttered squares before going  onto the nest lot.  The butter firms fairly quickly and it could be  difficult to shape the pastries if the buttered sheets are left for a time.    * From: The Complete Middle East Cookbook by Tess Mallos. * ISBN: 1 86302  069 1. * Typed for you by Karen Mintzias    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #213 by Lea Faulkner <lea@scott.net> on Aug  14, 1997
