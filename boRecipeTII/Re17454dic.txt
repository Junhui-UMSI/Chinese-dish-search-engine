Unsalted butter; room temp, Flour, Egg yolks, Semisweet chocolate; chopped, Brown Sugar, Salt, Toasted walnuts, Pure vanilla extract, 
Preheat oven to 350@. Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet in the preheated  oven for 6 mins. Cool the nuts to room temp. Process the walnuts in a food  processor fitted with a metal blade til finely chopped, about 8 to 10  seconds. Set aside til needed. Place the butter and sugar in a 7 qt bowl.  Use a rubber spatula to mix the ingredients together til well blended. Add  the egg yolks and vanilla and combine til incorporated. Add the flour and  salt and blend together til the mixture is smooth and thoroughly combined.  Transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13 x 2" nonstick baking pan. Use your  fingertips to press the mixture (the dough is sticky) onto the bottom of  the pan and into the corners and sides, creating an even layer. Place the  pan the center rack of the preheated oven and bake for 20 mins, til light  golden brown. Remove it from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chopped  chocolate over the hot toffee. Allow to stand 5 mins. Use a cake spatula to  spread the melted chocolate in a silky smooth and even layer. Sprinkle the  chopped walnuts over the melted chocolate in an even layer. Allow to cool  to room temp for 30 mins before cutting. Use a serrated knife with a  rounded tip to cut the walnut toffee into 24 - 2" squares, then cut each  square diagonally in half to form triangles. For a clean cut, heat the  blade of the knife under hot running water and wipe the blade dry before  making each cut. Serve immediately or store in a tightly sealed plastic  container.
