Pomegranate Granita
Sugar; or to taste, Pomegranates, 
Slice off the top and bottom of the pomegranates, then break them apart and  remove the seeds. With your hands, squeeze all of the juice out of the  seeds, then push the mixture through a sieve, pressing down gently to  extract as much juice as possible without pushing the bitter skins through.  Discard the seeds. In a large shallow glass baking dish that will fit in  your freezer, combine the juice with the sugar and stir until the sugar has  dissolved (place the pan over a very low flame if desired to speed the  dissolving of the sugar). Freeze for 4 hours, stirring every 15 minutes.  Scrape the surface of the ice with a spoon into large flaky crystals.  Refreeze if desired. The granita should be served as a chunky ice, not a  smooth sorbet.
