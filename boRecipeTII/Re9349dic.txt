Puffy Salami-Topped Pastries
Italian seasonings, Shredded Longhorn cheese, Diced salami, Sliced green onion, Sheet puff pastry, Egg, 
Remove 1 sheet of puff pastry from package; cover and let stand at room  temperature 20 to 30 minutes.    On a lightly floured board, roll pastry into 12x17-inch rectangle; transfer  to an un greased 10x15-inch jelly-roll pan, pushing up sides. Brush with  egg; prick all over with tines of a fork. Bake in a 450 deg. oven for 12 to  15 minutes or until brown and puffy. Remove from oven. (Note: If made  ahead, set pan with pastry on a rack until cool; cover and store at room  temperature up to 8 hours.) Sprinkle the cheese over pastry. Then sprinkle  cheese with the herb seasoning, salami, and onion. Bake in a 450 deg. oven  for 5 minutes (8 to 10 minutes if made ahead) or until cheese melts.    Let cool 5 minutes, then loosen pastry from pan with a spatula and slide  out onto a board. With a sharp knife, cut pastry into 2-inch squares. Makes  about 3 dozen.
