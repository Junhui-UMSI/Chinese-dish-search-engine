So sorry, I went and checked the FAQ and realized that what follows  is NOT vegan.]  But since I already typed up the recipe, I offer it here to  vegetarians who are not vegan.  The following recipe is adapted from a  former SAD version I created back in my days as a Swiss chef. Im still  getting used to the difference of being fat free. Id be interested if  other people like it.    Toss all together in big bowl, mix well with wire whip.  Pour into 2 pint  jars, give one to a friend, and enjoy the other (1 T per small salad is  ample).  Lasts several weeks refrigerated.
