Vegetable Finger Salad
Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing, Chopped carrots, Mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, Chopped broccoli, Cream cheese - 8 oz. each, Green Pepper, Mix (original recipe - dry), Pillsbury Crescent Rolls, 
Press out in one piece without separation 2 packages Pillsbury Crescent  Rolls in jelly roll pan or cookie sheet with edge (2 pans). Bake as  directed on Crescent Roll package and cool.    Mix together cream cheese, mayonnaise and Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.  Spread on cooled baked roll mix.    Mix together chopped vegetables and press into cream cheese mixture.    Refrigerate.  Cut into small squares.  Will keep several days in  refrigerator.    Personal Note:  This recipe makes a LOT.  I cut all ingredients in half and  still have plenty to serve (in addition to other snack foods). I also  replace half the mayo with non-fat yogurt, and replace the cheddar cheese  with a fourth vegetable to cut the fat content (Still tastes delicious).    The total servings will change depending on how large or small you cut each  piece.  I only listed 24 because Meal Master requires a number. Please  change once you make the recipe and count the pieces. Thanks.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Mar 03, 98
