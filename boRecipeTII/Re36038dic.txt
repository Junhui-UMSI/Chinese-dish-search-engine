From Scratch Save    Cut meat in thin slices. Meat is easier to cut when partially frozen and it  will cut evenly. Combine salt, peppers, meat tenderizers, seasoned salt,  accent, garlic and onion powders, kitchen bouquet, morton tender quick,  worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, barbecue sauce and liquid smoke. Marinate  meat in sauce for 24 hours in a sealable plastic bag. Place meat directly  on oven racks, line bottom of oven with foil, or on rack in shallow pan and  dry in oven for 6-8 hours on lowest setting. Continue to dry in warm oven  if necessary. Ovens with pilot lights work especially well. From: Steve  Herrick Date: 05-14-92    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Mar 06, 1998
