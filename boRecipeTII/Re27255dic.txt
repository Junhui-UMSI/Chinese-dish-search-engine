Stir until smooth; cool  to room temperature.    2. In large mixer bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Stir in melted  chips. Whip cream to form soft peaks. Gradually whisk into cream cheese  mixture, along with Cool Whip. Set aside.    3. Line side of 9x3 springform pan with lady finger halves, cut sides in.  In small bowl, combine coffee and brandy. Arrange 1/2 the remaining  ladyfingers on bottom of pan. Brush with half the coffee mixture. Cover  with half the filling. Slice 1 basket of strawberries-layer over filling.  Repeat ladyfinger, coffee and filling layer. Cover and refrigerate at least  4 hours or overnight. Remove side of pan. Halve remaining strawberries.  Arrange decoratively on top.    P.S. You may vary recipe by omitting berries, and sprinkling dry cocoa on  top of each layer. Also, you may wish to use a deep glass bowl, instead of  springform pan.
