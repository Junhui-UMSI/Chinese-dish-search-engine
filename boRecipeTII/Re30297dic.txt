1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13- by 9-inch baking pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.  2. Beat butter and granulated sugar in large bowl of electric mixer on high speed until light, 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stop  the mixer and add bananas, sour cream and vanilla. Mix in on low speed.  Fold in the dry ingredients and nuts with a rubber spatula.  3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes  out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely on wire rack.  4. For caramel glaze, combine brown sugar and condensed milk in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture begins to bubble. Reduce  heat to low and add butter; cook and stir until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in confectioners sugar and vanilla. Spread over cooled cake.   5. For frosting, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Stir in sour cream, maple and vanilla. Add enough confectioners sugar to make a smooth, thick frosting. Carefully spread over caramel glaze.     File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
