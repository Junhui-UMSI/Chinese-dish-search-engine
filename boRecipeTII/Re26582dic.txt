Let the machine knead the dough once, and then let the dough rise 20  minutes only in the machine.  Even if your cycle runs longer, simply remove  dough after 20 minutes and turn off the machine.  Divide the dough into the  appropriate number of pieces.  Roll each piece into a rope and make it into  a circle, pressing the ends together.  You may find it necessary to wet one  end slightly to help seal the ends together. Place shaped dough on a well  greased baking sheet, cover and let rise only 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile,  bring about 2 inches of water to a slight boil in a non-aluminum pan.  Carefully lower about 3 or 4 bagels at a time into the water, cooking for  about 30 seconds on each side. Remove bagels, drain on a towel, sprinkle  with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried onion bits, etc., and place on the  greased baking sheet.  Bake in a pre-heated 550 degree oven for 8 minutes.    >From: Judith Sherman <als@hpwalk.wal.hp.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Bread Machine Cookbook, Donna Rathmell German
