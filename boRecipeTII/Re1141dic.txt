Put the cooked cranberries through a food mill; do not drain the  liquid.    4.  Stir the sugar and the gelatin into the processed cranberries, stirring  until the sugar is dissolved.    5.

Turn out the partially frozen mixture and beat with a "mix-master"  until it is light in color.    8.  Freeze overnight.    How about using the ice cream freezer?
