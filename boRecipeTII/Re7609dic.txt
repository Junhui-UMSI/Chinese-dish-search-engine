Dredge pork steaks in flour and fry until brown in oil. Remove from  skillet. Add onion (sliced into rings) and the garlic (chopped) to skillet.  Saute in oil until onions are transparent. In 13 x 9 x 2-inch pan mix beans  and soup. Add onions and garlic after cooked. Arrange pork steaks on top.  Cover and bake in 350 degrees oven for 1 hour. My kids love this dish.
