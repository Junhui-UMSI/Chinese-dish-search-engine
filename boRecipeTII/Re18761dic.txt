From: Alison and John Krufka.  (I got this recipe from Minnesota  Public Radios "The Splendid Table") This marinade is warm and flavorable,  but not hot. It should work well with chicken, seafood, prok [and euks!]  and vegtables for grilling, braising or sauteing. It should keep about 1  month in the Frig. Makes about 1 cup.    In a heavy skillet over medium heat toast the cumin and coriander about 5  minutes, or until aromatic.  Grind to a powder in a coffee mill or with a  morter and pestle.  Add onion, garlic, and chilies to pan, roasting chilies  3 to 5 minutes until aromatic. Remove immediately. Take onion slices to  golden and garlic to slightley softened, about 10 minutes. Stem and seed  chilies, then cover with hot water and let soak 30 minutes. Meanwhile toast  the cinnamon, pepper and orange zest 10 seconds over medium heat. Combine  all ingredients in a blender (peeling garlic first), including chilies and  a few tablespoons of their liquid. Puree, season to taste, and refrigerate  until needed. Marinate larger pieces of meat or poultry from several hours  to overnight. Fish needs only an hour or so while vegetables are ready to  cook within the hour. Always refrigerate marinating foods.
