Sweet and Hot Bulgogi
Soy sauce, Brown sugar, Clove garlic (diced fine), Flank meat sliced thin 1/4, Green onions (chopped fine), Can crushed pineapple, Black pepper, Carrot (shredded), Yellow onion (chopped, Hot chili sesame oil, 
Mix all ingredients in a large mixing bowl (including juice from  pineapple). Let it marinate overnight or minimum 8 hours. Saute over med  high heat in large skillet or wok until meat is lightly browned. Ensure the  juice is added during cooking.This batch should take two trips to the stove  to cook. I like it served over the wide crispy La Choy noodles.(my friend  prefers the noodles) I would use steamed rice...
