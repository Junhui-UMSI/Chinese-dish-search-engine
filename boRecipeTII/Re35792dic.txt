Slowly add 2 cups of sugar to the milk.  Blend well.  Mix in salt and  extracts.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of sugar on a board and knead the mixture into  the sugar.  The mixture should be smooth and creamy.  Put mixture in  refrigerator for up to 24 hours.  Use the mixture to stuff the dates. You  may want to put coconut or walnuts in the mixture. This recipe makes 4 to 5  dozen dates.    Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #95
