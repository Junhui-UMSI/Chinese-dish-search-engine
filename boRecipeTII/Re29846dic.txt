1. Remove and discard fat from meat. Cut meat across the grain into thin  slices.    2. Combine sherry, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, cornstarch, baking soda,  salt and garlic in medium glass bowl. Mix in meat. Cover and refrigerate at  least 3 hours.    3. Heat oil in wok over high heat. Stir-fry onions in the oil until golden,  3 to 5 minutes. Transfer onions to serving plate. Keep warm.    4. Add about 1/3 of the meat to wok, spreading out slices so they do not  overlap. Cook slices on each side just until lightly browned, 2 to 3  minutes. Remove meat from pan and arrange over onion slices. Repeat twice  to cook remaining meat.
