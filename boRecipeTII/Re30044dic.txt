Balsalmic Risotto
Bay leaf, Butter, Onion, Balsalmic vinegar, Dried Rosemary, Vegetable stock, Grated Parmesan, Arborio rice, Cabernet or barolo, 
Put 50g of butter, the chopped half onion, the bayleaf and the pinch of  rosemary into a casserole dish and cook over medium heat until the onion is  transparent. Then add the rice and stir continuously for one minute until  all is well mixed. Then add a "good" cup of vegetable stock and bring the  whole to the boil.    Add the half a litre of red wine and let the alcohol evaporate off. After  15 minutes add the freshly grated parmesan and the other 50g of butter.  Stir and then let it cook for another minute.    Just before removing from the stove add a small glass of balsalmic vinegar.    This smells and tastes wonderful!
