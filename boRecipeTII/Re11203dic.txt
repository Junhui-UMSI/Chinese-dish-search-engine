Place the raisins and the water into a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cover and  simmer on low for about 5 minutes.    Combine the brown sugar, flour and salt in a small bowl. Add to the  raisins, cook and stir until the mixture comes back to the boil and  thickens. Remove from the heat.    Stir in the lemon juice and optional lemon rind.

Dampen the edges of the pastry.    Roll out the top crust and cover the filling; trim and crimp the the edges  to seal.
