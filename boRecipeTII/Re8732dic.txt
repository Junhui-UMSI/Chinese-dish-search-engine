Combine flour and baking powder.  Combine  milk and vanilla. Add some of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then  pour in some of the liquid. Repeat this, stirring lightly with each  addition. Line 2 loaf pans with buttered waxed paper. Fill pans. Bake in  preheated 325 degree oven for 1 hour. This will be tiring without an  electric mixer or a cooperative boyfriend.
