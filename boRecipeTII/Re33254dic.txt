Basic Recipe for a Tea Smoke
Cloves, 6oz boneless skinless, ENOUGH SMOKE FOR 4, Tea leaves from 2 earl Grey, Raw brown rice, CHICKEN BREAST, olive oil, Brown sugar, 
Take 3 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil 15 inches square and start  rolling the edges under to from a circle that fits in the bottom of your  Dutch oven -- in our case, a foil saucer approximately 5 inches in  diamerter.  When the edge is rolled to about 1 inch high, stop and flatten  it. Then, depress the center to hold the smoke ingredients.    In the depression of the aluminum foil saucer first sprinkle the rice, then  the sugar, cloves and the contents of the tea bags. The order of  ingredients is very important. Place the foil dish in Dutch oven, cover  tightly and cook over high heat until ingredients in the foil start smoking  ~- about 5 minutes.    Brush a steamer platform with the olive oil.  Place the chicken on  platform, skinned side up.  Put into Dutch oven over the smoke ingredients,  cover and continue smoking over high heat until done -- about 11 minutes.
