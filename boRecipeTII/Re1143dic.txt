Cranberry, Apple And Orange Relish
Fresh cranberries; washed, Apples; cored & cut in, Oranges; (preferably naval), Crushed pineapple, 
In batches, grind first 3 ingredients in food processor or grinder. Add 1  can crushed pineapple (in its own juice). Mix well. Let sit for a few  hours, then serve.    Ive made this for so long I dont remember where I got it. You could also  add chopped walnuts but it is good this way.
