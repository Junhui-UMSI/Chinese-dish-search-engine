Zucchini with Blossoms
olive oil, Butter, zucchini, Zucchini, blossoms, Cornmeal, 
1.  Slice the zucchini in half, lengthwise. (Slice right though the blossom  too, so they are still attached to the squash) 2. Dip the cut side down, in  melted butter and then in cornmeal. 3. Heat olive oil in a skillet over low  heat and fry zucchini (with blossom      attatched)  for about 3 min. until  lightly      browned. (Serve 3 halves on each plate) 4. Remove from pan and  drain on paper toweling. Now thats it. Very easy, very delicious, and it  looks great! This book also has a recipe for scented geranium muffins.  E/mail me if interested. Love and a recipe for weeds please!
