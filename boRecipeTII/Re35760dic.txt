Bone the chicken wings by cutting around the bone with a sharp knife.  Holding the wingtip, gently ease the bone away to leave the skin and a thin  layer of chicken.    Soak the vermicelli in warm water for 10 minutes then drain thoroughly and  cut into short strands.  Soak the wood ear fungus in warm water for 10  minutes then squeeze dry and chop into thin slices.    Mix all the stuffing ingredients together.  The mixture should be firm.  Mold the stuffing into a ball and insert it into the bag of flesh and skin  of the chicken wing.    Preheat the oven to 400F.  Steam the stuffed wings for 10-15 minutes. (If  you want to make a large quantity, multiply the measures accordingly and  freeze after the steaming stage.    After steaming, place in a lightly oiled roasting pan and roast in the oven  for 30 minutes.  Serve on a bed of lettuce as a starter or with rice and a  beef stir-fried dish.
