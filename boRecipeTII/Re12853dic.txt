Zabaglione #4
Strawberries, Granulated sugar, Cannoli shells, Gaufrettes, Cinnamon, Chablis, Marsala wine, vanilla ice cream, Egg yolks, 
1. Place a large scoop of ice cream in each of four large wine glasses.  Freeze for 1 hour.    2. In a medium copper mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cinnamon,  chablis, and Marsala.  Place the mixing bowl over medium heat and continue  whisking vigorously until the mixture at least triples in size and holds  its peaks, about 5 minutes.    3. Remove the wine glasses from the freezer and divide the strawberries  equally among them.  Pour the hot custard over.  Garnish with crushed  cannoli shells and one gaufrette per serving. Serve immediately. It is very  important that you do not stop whisking the mixture while it is over the  heat; continual motion prevents the yolks from cooking into scrambled eggs  and censures an even custard. We recommend a copper bowl because it  distributes heat more evenly.
