This pretty dessert is also easy to achieve with ready-made frozen phyllo  dough sheets and fresh fruit. For a finishing touch, sprinkle tops with  NutraSweet Spoonful.    CUT PHYLLO into 8-inch squares (24). Spray 4 phyllo squares lightly with  vegetable spray; layer squares, turning each slight- ly so that corners are  staggered. Carefully fit phyllo into 8- ounce custard cup, shaping edges to  form "nest" Repeat with remaining phyllo squares.    ARRANGE FRUIT in bottom of each "nest" Place custard cups on cookie sheet  and bake at 375 degrees until phyllo is golden and fruit tender, about 15  minutes.    COOL ON WIRE RACKS; carefully remove "nests" from custard cups. Serve warm  or room temperature with Fruit Sauce.    Fruit Sauce: PUREE BERRIES in blender or food processor. If using  raspberries, strain and discard seeds. Stir NutraSweet Spoonful into puree.  Refrigerate until serving time.    Makes 1 cup.
