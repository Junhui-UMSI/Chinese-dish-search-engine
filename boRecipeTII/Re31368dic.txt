Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and 2  tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while preparing the  remaining vegetables.    Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the onions  until they are limp.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they give up their  juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve.    Put the chicken and its spices in the skillet, being careful to drain most  of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and slightly browned. Add  the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3 minutes. Add the rice, the  reserved vegetables and enough of the chicken stock to keep the rice from  sticking.    Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the almonds and  serve immediately.    Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I very  often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With cooked  vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and add them just  early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not to use vegetables  that will become mushy with the heating, you will want them to still be  tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli, even spinach.
