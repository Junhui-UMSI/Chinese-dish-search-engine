Variation of Bean Burger calling for Kidney Beans posted on Intercook by  Sandee Eveland.  I didnt have all the right ingredients for that recipe so  experimented with black beans instead.    Mix all ingredients well.  Using 1/4 lb hamburger press, make four burgers.    Can vary the taste with more/less spices.    Preheat electric skillet to 350 degrees.  Spray with vegetable spay. Fry  burgers about 15 minutes, turning once or twice until surface is golden  brown and burger feels "set"    The consistency of these burgers "May" allow them to be grilled on bbq.  Have not tried that yet.    Will have son evaluate this experiment. These passed the taste test!    ++ Courtesy of Dale & Gail Shipp, Columbia Md. ++  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Oct 20, 98
