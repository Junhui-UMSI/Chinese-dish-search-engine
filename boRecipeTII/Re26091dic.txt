"Great on caesar (see variation at the end of recipe) or any other  salad..Its a good idea although not necessary, to blanch the tofu before  using it in this recipe. Just drop it into boiling water, simmer 2 to 3  minutes, then drain it on paper towels." In food processor or blender,  blend garlic, water, vinegar, oil, mustard, salt, thyme and pepper With  motor running, gradually add tofu; process until smooth. Mix in parsley.  Taste; adjust seasoning. VARIATION: for tofu caesar dressing (non  vegetarian) , reduce salt to a pinch. Blend in 4 anchovies with mustard  mixture. Add 1/4 cup grated parmesan with tofu.
