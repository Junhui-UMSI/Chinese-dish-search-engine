Strawberries with Jazzed Up Whipped Cream
Kahlua, whipping cream, Oregon strawberries, 
1/2"    thick slices pound cake    Strawberries with Jazzed up Whipped Cream xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xx  xxxxxxx xxxxx    This idea came to me yesterday when I bought my first basket of Oregon  strawberries for this season.  Brag all you want about your regional  products, but there is nowhere on this earth where strawberries are sweeter  or tastier than in Oregon, especially around the Portland metro area.    Whip cream, add Kahlua during final stage. Place sliced pound cake on a  plate, top with berries and slather on whipped cream.    These recipes are of my own creation and I expect (and deserve) appropriate  credit when you add them to your cookbook
