Taters and Chiles
Salt and pepper, Bacon (cooked crisp) or ham, Vegetable oil, Sharp Cheddar cheese, Eggs, Onion, Your favorite pepper, Potatos; peeled, sliced very, 
Here is a good recipe for potatos and chiles: I wont give exact  measurements because I "cook by the seat of my pants".  Take some potatos,  peel them, and slice them very thin - maybe 1/10".  Dice an onion.  Grate  some cheese - sharp cheddar - bout a cup or two (I like more) Youll need  your favorite pepper. I use poblano, but remember if you use poblano, new  mexes, etc youll have to roast and peel them first. These should be diced  as well. Will need a few eggs - mixed up a bit, but not whipped. Some bacon  (cooked crisp) or ham is nice too. Will need a bit of oil. Salt and pepper  too.    Now do this: Coat the bottom of a skillet with oil or butter.  Put a layer  of taters down on top of the oil.  Follow with chiles, onion, and bacon.  Salt and Pepper. Lay down another layer of taters, chiles, etc. Put top on  the skillet and turn the heat on LOW - you want to cook the taters slowly  to "fork tender. When taters are done, pour egg mixture over this - in a  stream all over it. When egg has firmed up, sprinkle cheese on top and let  it melt good. Now eat it!    I firmly belive this stuff will cure a hang-over, but have no proof.  I  guess Ill just have to keep experimenting.  BTY, this goes good with V8  juice laced with salt, worchester sauce, and tobasco sauce.    Brent Jones <jones@msuacad.morehead-st.edu>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
