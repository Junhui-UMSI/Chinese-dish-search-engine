In a bowl large enough to hold the chicken mix all ingredients except the  chicken. Place chicken in the bowl turning several times so the whole bird  has been covered by the sauce. Cover the bowl and marinade for 1-4 hours in  the refrigerator, turning several times. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Remove chicken from the marinade and remove most of the pieces of ginger  and garlic that are sticking to the bird. The marinade will stick to the  pan so coat first with nonstick spray. Place the chicken breast side up.  Roast for 20 mins. then reduce temperature to 350 degree. When the skin  starts to crisp brush with marinade every 20 mins. If skin is getting to  dark tent with foil. Cook until juices run clear. Let sit for 15 mins.  before removing skin and carving.
