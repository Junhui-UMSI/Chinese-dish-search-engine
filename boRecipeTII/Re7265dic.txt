Pork Chop Bake
Pepper, Potatoes, Water, PORK CHOPS, SEASONING SALT, Sliced, Onion, Cream of mushroom soup, Flour, 
Flour, season & brown pork chops in skillet, set aside. Peel and slice  enough potatoes to line roasting pan, filling to desired depth. Slice an  onion over the raw potatoes and salt to taste. Place browned pork chops on  top of potatoes. Pour two cans of cream of mushroom soup and a can of water  over the chops. Bake (maybe 350F) uncovered about 1 hour or until potatoes  are done. Length of time depends on the amount of food as explained  below... You can use as few pork chops & potatoes as you want, or as many  as you can cram into the pan. I generally buy a pork loin or whatever is on  sale at my favorite supermarket. Ive even substituted pork steak for pork  chops & that works too. I found that adding a little more wateer makes more  gravy over potatoes.    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
