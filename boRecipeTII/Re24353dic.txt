Heat oven to 325. Toast hazelnuts 10-15 min.  Put dry ingredients (except  nuts) down through espresso powder in bowl of elec. mixer. Combine, then  toss in nuts and choc. chips. In a separate bowl, lightly whisk eggs and  vanilla.  With mixer running on low, gradually add egg mixture and mix  until dough comes together. Dump dough on lightly floured surface, divide  into four parts, and with floured hands, roll each part into a log about 10  in. long and 2 in. in diameter. Place logs 4 in. apart on greased baking  sheets.  Bake at 325 for 30-35 minutes, until sides are firm, tops are  cracked. Reduce oven to 300.  Let logs cool on baking sheet at least 10  min. before slicing.  Cut logs on a slight diagonal into 3/4 in. slices.  Place biscotti flat on baking sheet and dry them in oven for about 25 min.,  until they offer resistance when pressed. Transfer to a rack to cool.      While they are cooling, melt white chocolate and spread on one cut side  of each biscotti.  Put them white-chocolate side down on a parchment-lined  baking sheet. Allow chocolate to harden. Peel biscotti from parchment and  enjoy.
