Pickled Garlic (Kratiem Dong)

Heres something that might appeal those of you engaged in the Garlic  Thread.  Its not for everyone, but if youre a true garlic fan, these  munchies might be right up your alley.  Thai garlic comes in pods  that are about the same size as Western garlic but the cloves are  about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of ours and there are correspondingly more  in a head. The plus is that they dont have to be skinned before use.  The emphasis here is on the sour rather than the sweet.  Quite a  taste sensation. In a medium saucepan, bring the vinegar, water,  sugar and salt to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Drop  in the garlic.  Return to boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat.  Cool, and fill sterilized, screw-top jars. Store in the refrigerator  for at least 1 week before eating. Continue to refrigerate, tightly  covered, between serving.
