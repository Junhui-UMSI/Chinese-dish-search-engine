Yucatan Style Ceviche
Habaneros, Shrimp, Fresh orange juice, Fish Fillets, Fresh lime juice, Sweet Onion, 
Cut the fish in 1/4-inch slices; remove any bones as you go.  Place the  fish in a glass or glazed ceramic dish large enough to hold it in one  layer.    Shell and devein the shrimp, rinsing them only if necessary to rid them of  grit.  Slice the shrimp in half lengthwise or butterfly them. Layer the  shrimp over the fish.    Slice the onion in half lengthwise, then crosswise in thin slices. Layer  the onion over the fish and shrimp.    Wearing rubber gloves, stem, seed and sliver the Habaneros and scatter them  over the onions.  Season the dish with salt and pour on the lime and orange  juices.  Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight,  or until the fish and shrimp are opaque. Serve at cool room temperature.
