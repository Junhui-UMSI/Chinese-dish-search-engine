1. Place wheat berries and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over  high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until very  tender, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.    2. Add oil, orange juice, vinegar, coriander, caraway seeds, apples, mint,  salt and pepper. Toss well.    3. Just before serving, add cashews; mix well.    NOTE: you may substitute cooked brown rice or coarse cracked wheat for the  wheat berries. But wheat berries add a pleasingly chewy texture.
