This was adapted from a recipe by Bruce Cost.  It was origianlly called  Szechuan, but after I eliminated the oil, and some other stuff, it tasted  more Japanese to me, so I compromised and called it "Asian".    The chili paste adds a bit of zing, but this is not hot at all.  Add more  if you like it spicy. Also, the original recipe calls for the cucumbers to  be peeled and seeded, but I am too lazy! I rather like it soupy, so seed  them if you dont like your salad so soupy...  :)    Toss together and serve. *Yummy*!!!  :)    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #50    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
