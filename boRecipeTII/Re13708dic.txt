Wild Rice Casserole
Garlic, Vegetable broth, Wild rice, uncooked, Onion, Fresh mushrooms, sliced, 
Rinse wild rice well.  Combine wild rice, mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a  3 quart casserole dish. Pour broth over it all, cover, and bake at 350  degrees for about 1 1/2 hours.    I use the "jumbo domestic Canadian" wild rice for the best results, but any  wild rice will taste good.  I usually stir after an hour of baking.  The  liquid is absorbed all at once toward the end, dont panic!  I add a  teaspoon of salt when entertaining SAD eaters, and often increase the  amount of onion and garlic when my husband and I are eating alone.    I am a wild rice fanatic and mail order mine from a place in Minnesota.  I  can e-mail the address to anyone who is interested.
