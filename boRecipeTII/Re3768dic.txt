Penne with Ricotta, Lemon and Basil
Extra virgin olive oil for, Lemon; Thinly pared zest of,, (scant 1 cup) fresh ricotta, Penne or any shore dried, Freshly grated Parmigiano, Salt, Generous amount of fresh, 
A very refreshing pasta, wonderful followed by a salad of mixed leaves with  plenty of fennel, carrots, spring onions (scallions) and maybe the red  onion frittata. This is a light summer dinner to impress all vegetarian  friends, and it can be prepared in under half an hour. Remember to buy the  freshest ricotta available.    In a large bowl heat the ricotta with the lemon zest using a balloon whisk,  adding salt, black pepper and the basil. Cook the pasta in plenty of  lightly salted boiling water. Add a ladle of water from the pasta to the  ricotta mixture to moisten it a little and then place the bowl over the  pasta pan for a few minutes to soften the mixture. When the pasta is al  dente, drain it and mix with the ricotta. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and  drizzle with a little olive oil.
