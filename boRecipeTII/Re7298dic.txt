Dry the chops with paper towels.  Season with salt and pepper. In a large  heavy skillet heat 3 T of olive oil until it is almost smoking. Brown the  chops for 2 or 3 minutes on each side and remove them to a plate. Pour out  all but 2 T of the fat. Lower the heat.  Add the shallots and garlic and  cook until soft.  Make sure not to burn them. Add the paprika, tomatoes and  wine. Bring the mixture to a boil and lower the heat. Add the hot chili  pepper, tomato paste, green pepper and rosemary. Return the chops to the  pan.  Cover it tightly and let them simmer for 45 minutes. Five minutes  before they are ready, add the roasted red peppers. Remove the chops to a  serving dish. If the sauce seems a little thin, raise the heat and reduce  it until it heavily coats the spoon. Discard the rosemary. Correct the  seasoning and pour the sauce over the chops. Garnish with parsley and serve  immediately. Note: This dish can be cooked in a 350 degree oven for 45 to  50 minutes and can be served over rice pilaf.
