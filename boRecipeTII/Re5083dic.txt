Pico De Gallo (Roosters Beak)

I agree with Rich. Real Mexican "Pico de Gallo" is a very simple recipe  using ground dried chiles as a condiment with various fruits. One of the  simplest is found in "The Complete Book of Mexican Cooking" by Elizabeth  Lambert Ortiz, copyright 1965 by The Conde Nast Publications Inc. It goes  as follows:    Mix the jicama and oranges together, and season with salt and cayenne to  taste.    * Very tart cooking apples may be substituted for the jicama, although the  results may be less than perfect, since jicama has a unique flavor that is  not easily duplicated.    I tried this recipe, substituting Jim Campbells apple smoked habinero  powder for cayenne and it tasted great.
