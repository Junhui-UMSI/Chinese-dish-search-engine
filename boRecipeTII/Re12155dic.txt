olive oil, Salt and pepper -- to taste, Parsley, Garlic cloves -- minced, Roasted red bell pepper --, Onion -- chopped, Diced, Eggs, Zucchini -- diced, 
Beat together the eggs with salt and pepper to taste.    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped  onion and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring often, or until it begins to  soften.    Add the red pepper and cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the pepper  begins to soften. Add the zucchini and garlic with salt and pepper to  taste. Add 1 more tablespoon oil, if necessary, or 2 tablespoons water.    Cook for five to ten minutes, stirring, until the zucchini is tender but  still bright green. Stir in chopped parsley. Stir the filling into the  beaten eggs.    Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high  heat. Pour in the egg mixture and stir with a fork.    Shake the pan gently, lifting up the edge of the frittata to let the egg  mixture run underneath. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for about  10 minutes. The eggs should be just set.    Brown the top of the frittata under the broiler for about 2 minutes. Let  cool.    Loosen the edge of the frittata from the pan with a spatula. Slide the  frittata out of the pan.    Cut the frittata into diamond-shaped pieces and arrange in a decorative  pattern on a serving platter.
