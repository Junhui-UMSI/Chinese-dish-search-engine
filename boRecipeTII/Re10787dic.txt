Quick-Mix Spritz
Salt, All-Purpose Flour, Vanilla, Baking Powder, Almond extract (optional), Sugar, Egg, Butter, 
Sift dry ingredients together into a bowl. With a pastry blender or  two knives, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until mixture is  full of very fine lumps. It will resemble pie crust or biscuit mix,  although not as coarse. Measure egg in a measuring cup. A large egg  will measure 1/4 cup. If it does not, add water to the 1/4 cup line.  Add the egg and vanilla (and almond, if using) to the dough, and beat  the mixture very well. Fill cookie press. Form cookies on ungreased  cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes at 375 degrees. Remove at once  to cooling racks. Makes 5 to 6 dozen.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
