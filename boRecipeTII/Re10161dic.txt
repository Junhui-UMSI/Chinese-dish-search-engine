Quiche Lorraine
Salt, Egg white, White Pepper, Ground, Nutmeg, Grated, Chives, Chopped, Pate Brisee, Cream, Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Diced, Eggs, 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the baking pan with the Pate Brisee  to form the shell. Brush with the egg white and prick it thoroughly. Chop  the bacon into 1" lengths and cook, stirring constantly, until the fat is  almost all rendered out but the bacon isnt quite crisp. Drain the bacon on  paper toweling. Scald the cream, then cool. Combine the eggs, salt, pepper,  nutmeg and chives in the cream. Sprinkle the bacon and the Swiss cheese in  the bottom of the shell. Pour the batter into the shell. Bake until the top  is golden brown (you may test as for a custard) (about 35 or 40 minutes).
