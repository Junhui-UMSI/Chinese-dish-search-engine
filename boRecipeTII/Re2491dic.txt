Braised Meat with Butternut Squash (Stufadin di Zuca Zala) was posted in  The Naples Daily News food section, Naples FL, Wednesday, September 16,  1998 (from a Scripps Howard release- author not given)    *Note: halved, seeds and fibers removed, peeled, cut into 1/2- inch cubes  and parboiled in salted water for 5 minutes    Warm 2 tbsp of the olive oil in a saute pan over low heat. Add the onions,  garlic and rosemary, saute until tender and translucent, about 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and set aside.    Warm the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a heavy pot over high heat.  Add the meat and brown well on all sides, sprinkling with a little salt  after it has browned. Add the wine and let it bubble up.    Add the sauteed onions, the butternut squash and the broth to cover; bring  to a boil.    Cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently until the meat is tender  and the squash has formed a puree, 1 hour to 1- 1/4 hours. Season with salt  and pepper before serving.    Makes 4 to 6 servings.    Variation: you can use 3/4 pound carrots, peeled and grated, in place of  the squash.
