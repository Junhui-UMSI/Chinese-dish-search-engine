Davenport <cdavenpo@PigsEye.Kennesaw.EDU>    This is the recipe I have and my directions dont specify what goes where  either.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sift flour and sugar, set aside. In a  saucepan, bring the margarine, cocoa and water to a boil; remove from heat.  In a large bowl, mix all remaining cake ingredients. Add the flour mixture  and cocoa mixture, stirring well. Bake in a greased and floured 9x13" pan  for 20 to 30 min. Check for doneness with a clean toothpick. Ten minutes  into the baking of the cake, prepare the frosting. Place the margarine,  cocoa, and milk in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and  add the remaining ingredients. Beat until smooth. FROST THE CAKE AS SOON AS  IT COME OUT OF THE OVEN. Let it cool a little before cutting, if you cant  possible hold out!. This cake is so good, youd eat it with one foot in the  fire if you had to.
