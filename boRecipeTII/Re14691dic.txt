The "trick" in this Syrian-Lebanese vegetable soup is that theres no  meat in the kibbeh "meatballs." The idea that a vegetarian dish is a  deception (vegetarian dolmas are known as yalanji, the Turkish word  for "counterfeit") goes back at least 1,200 years in the Near East.    In bowl, mix bulgur, flour, 1/2 tablespoon salt, cinnamon, green  onions, mint and parsley. Add enough water to make thick dough. Rolls  into 24 very firmly packed balls the size of large marbles. Set aside  to dry.    Put 9 cups chicken stock in pot, add lentils and bring to boil 10  minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons, reduce heat and simmer until lentils  are tender, 20-25 minutes.    Add bulgur balls and boil 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, garlic and oil.  Simmer until balls are done, 10 minutes. Garnish with thin lemon  slices.
