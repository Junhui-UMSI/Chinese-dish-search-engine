For the greens, use a combination of spinach, mustard,  collard, beet, chard,  and/ or radicchio. Avoid older, tougher leaves.  Remove rib from chard if too old.  Tear large pieces (larger than 3  inches), placing them and the orange sections in a large bowl. In a large  skillet, bring salad dressing mixture to boiling.  Add red pepper strips.  Remove skillet from heat.  Pour hot mixture over the greens, tossing to  mix.  To serve with a grilled meat or fish steak...  arrange some greens on  individual dinner plate.  Arrange some of the red pepper slices around the  outside (perimeter).  Place meat in center.  Make a fan of 3 orange  sections on the greens and garnish with zest strands or curls. Drizzle a  spoonful of the dressing on top of the grilled entree.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #87    From the MasterCook recipe list.
