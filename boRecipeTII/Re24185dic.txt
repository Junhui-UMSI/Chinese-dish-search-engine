I forgot about a kid-pleasing quick meal until mine asked for it last night  ~ the SAD version was affectionately called Train Wreck by the college  student who used to make it for group meals. My version is still like some  sort of transportation mishap, but its got veggies in it, they eat it, and  its nearly fatfree!    In a large pot, boil enough water to cook the macaroni and, in a separate  pot, heat the veggie broth for the beef not. When the broth comes to a  boil, add a couple of drops of liquid smoke if desired and the beef not,  boil again and then simmer until liquid is nearly gone. Meanwhile, cook the  macaroni. At this point the kids pour the frozen veggies into the colander  and, when the macaroni is done, I pour it over the veggies to defrost them.  Of course, if youre using canned, you dont need to add them to the  colander. ;) Pour some of the spaghetti sauce into the bottom of the large  pot and then put the beef not, macaroni and veggies in, adding the rest of  the sauce over it and mixing well. Heat the mixture thoroughly, covered,  over medium low heat, stirring occasionally. Top with soy mozzarella and  cover. Serve when cheese is melted. Very junk-food tasting and fast!
