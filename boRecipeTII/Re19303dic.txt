Have all the vegetables ready to cook - chopped and in containers. Pour  about 1 oz of white wine in a large lined pot. When wine is boiling, dump  in carrots and stir vigorously. Allow bottom to become a little dry then  add a small amount of wine. Continue until carrots begin to soften then add  each of the other ingredients in turn until all are in pot. Add small  amounts of wine as necessary, but allow bottom to become somewhat dry  without burning. Remember to keep STIRRING! Add the garlic last but allow  to cook for only about 30 seconds. After all vegetables are in pot, add  tomatoes and tomato paste. It is possible to buy GROUND canned tomatoes, if  not, no big loss. Wash out cans with a quantity of red wine and add to pot.  Add basil, rosemary - ground in spice mill, a little oregano, the cilantro,  chicken base - or bouillon cubes - black pepper and red pepper, stir cover  pot and turn heat down until sauce is barely boiling. Cook until vegetables  are tender and then run through food mill to puree. Return to pot. Bring  barely to boil, adjust seasonings, cover and heat for about one half hour.  Pour over your spaghetties and mangia! Save some of the red wine to go with  the spaghetties.  :    D/L from Prodigy 12-8-94.            Recipe collection of Sue Smith. 1.80?
