1. Heat the tomato juice and stock in a large pan and leave on a gentle  simmer. Heat the oil in a separate large pan and cook the onion and garlic  for 5 minutes until softened.    2. Stir in the rice to coat with the oil, then add a ladleful of the hot  stock. Cook over a gentle heat, stirring continuously, until the liquid has  been absorbed. Continue in this way until nearly all the stock has been  added (this will take about 20 minutes).    3. Add the tomatoes and basil with the remaining stock and cook, stirring  occasionally, until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender.  Season to taste.
