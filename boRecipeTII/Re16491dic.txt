This is a recipe I found on Mimis Cyberkitchen page. I made it for  Christmas dinner on Thursday. It is really, really good -- it also tastes  just as good the next day (if theres any left). The only change I made was  to use slivers of red onion because I didnt have any scallions. The feta  cheese is essential, I think.    1.Mix all the ingredients for the vinaigrette and reserve.    2.Combine all the ingredients for the salad.    3.Add the vinaigrette and mix thoroughly.    The vinaigrette can be added well in advance of serving.    Yield: 6 servings    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Lyn Belisle <belisle@TENET.EDU> on Dec 27,  1997
