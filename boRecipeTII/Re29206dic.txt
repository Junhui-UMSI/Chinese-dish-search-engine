Dry shrimp on paper towels; dip first into crumbs, then eggs, then into  crumbs again.    3. Place shrimp in well-oiled shallow baking pan so they do not touch;  sprinkle with salt and pepper.    4. Turn once with a broad spatula so that both sides are oiled.    5. Bake in preheated 450F. oven 6 to 8 minutes. Serve with Shrimp Sauce or  your favorite sauce. SHRIMP SAUCE:    1. Combine all ingredients; chill.    2. Serve with baked or broiled shrimp.    NOTE: You may prefer broiled shrimp. Follow the same recipe, but cook only  2 minutes on each side under the broiler.
