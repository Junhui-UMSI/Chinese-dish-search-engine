Alligator Bites
Alligator, Dixie Fry, Cooking oil, salt and pepper, 
Dust the alligator in the dry Dixie Fry, shake off the excess and deep fry  in the cooking oil (use a deep fat frier if you have one). Cook until just  golden brown. Serve hot with a Tartar sauce or a red horseradish cocktail  type sauce. These are very easy to make but very tasty. Be sure and cut  them in bite sized pieces so they wont be tough and will cook quickly. If  two pounds is too much use only one pound.    NOTES : Wild Boar can be substituted very nicely in this recipe.    Recipe by: LeRoy Trnavsky    Posted to MasterCook Digest by drleroy@juno.com (LeRoy C Trnavsky) on Sep  8, 1998,
