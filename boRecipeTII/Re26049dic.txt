Tofu Jerky
Onion powder, Clove crushed fresh garlic, Garlic powder or, Firm or extra firm tofu, Water, Fresh ground black pepper, Honey, Soy sauce, To 4 tb liquid smoke, 
Cut and drain the tofu.  I usually take a 1 lb cube, cut it in half,and  then slice it into strips on its short side. Strips should be about 4-5 mm  in thickness. They may look big, but theyll shrink to about half their  size.    Mix all the marinade ingredients together well. Put the tofu in a single  layer in a shallow baking pan or cookie sheet and pour the marinade over  it.  Let soak for several hours or overnight.    Drain excess liquid (and reuse!) and dry tofu in food dehydrator or warm  (200 F) oven.  This will take probably 4-8 hours, depending on weather. If  you live in a sunny, dry climate (Colorado in the summer), you can sun dry  it, itll take all day.    If you dry indoors in the winter, your house gets filled with a wonderful  smoky smell. If youre drying in the oven, youll need to flip the tofu  over hourly so it dries evenly. The stuff is delicious and keeps  indefinitely.  Dry the stuff until its very chewy, but not crispy.    Be creative: Use low-sodium soy if you want less salt (it is rather salty)  Use tabasco or ground cayenne if you want it hot. Chili powder makes chili  jerky. Oregano and basil makes pizza jerky.
