The dough has to be thick but has to drop of a  spoon slowly ,if to thick add a little bit more cold coffe. Grease a  cookiesheet very good and with a wet spatula spread the dough out on  it,about 1 cm thick. Heat oven to 350 gegress F and put the  cookiesheet on the highest rack in the oven. Bake about 20 minutes.  Make the glaze and immedietly glaze the dough when it it comes out of  the oven, cool a little and cut into rectangles. Store in a tightly  closed tin container so they stay soft. Those are the old,  traditional German Lebkuchen and the stores just add fancier shapes  and chocolate icings.The best is to expiriment a little.
