Potatoes Cooked with Garlic and Sesame Seeds
Sesame seeds, Salt, Vegetable oil, Potatoes, Ground turmeric, Good-sized cloves garlic --, Medium-sized boiling, Peeled and slivered, Cayenne pepper -- optional, Ground asafetida -- ground, 
Peel the potatoes and cut into fingers ("French fries"), 1/3- to 1/2-inch  thick. Put fingers into a bowl of cold water for half an hour or more.  Drain and wipe dry.    Heat the oil in an 8- to 9-inch skillet [or wok] over a medium flame. When  it is hot, put in the potatoes and cook them, turning once or twice, for 8  to 10 minutes. The potatoes should be partially cooked and not browned.  Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside.    Put the sesame seeds into the same skillet. Stir once. Now add the slivers  of garlic, continuing to stir and fry over a medium flame. When the garlic  begins to turn brown [the browning happens quickly], put in the turmeric  and asafetida. Stir once. Now quickly add the half-cooked potatoes, salt,  and cayenne. Stir again. Cover. Turn heat to low and cook gently until  potatoes are done. Stir frequently.
