Source: Gloria Pitzers Secret Recipes (pamphlet)    Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine cake mix, eggs + water, oil and cocoa  powder. Blend well until you can form it into a ball. Let stand 20 minutes.  Form dough into 1/2-inch balls placed 2 inches apart on lightly greased  baking sheet Flatten each ball with bottom of a greased once drinking glass  that has been dipped in Nestles Quik powder to deepen the color of the  cookies to resemble the originals. Bake 8 minutes. Immediately out of the  oven, flatten each cookie with the back of a pancake turner. Let cool 20  minutes while you prepare the filling.    The filling: Soften the gelatin in 1/4 C cold water and place in a pan of  hot water until clear. Meanwhile, beat the Crisco until fluffy, adding the  powdered sugar a little at a time. Add the vanilla and cooled gelatin and  beat 6 minutes. Shape into 1-inch balls and place between the bottom sides  of two cookies, pressing them gently but firmly together until the filling  becomes nicely rounded at the edges. Chill about one hour to set the  filling.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest Volume 98 #020 by fancymom@juno.com (Frances  Kahn) on Jan 10, 1998
