Portuguese Tuna
Dz rosemary (dried), Bell pepper (chopped) or 1, Cayenne pepper, Salt, Tuna (drained) (I used water, Cumin, Onion (sliced), Tomato sauce can water, olive oil, Tomato sauce, 
Saute the onion in the olive oil until tender. Add tuna and remaining  ingredients and simmer 10 minutes. Jackie says this is a foolproof recipe  and always turns out. She says she uses two dashes of red pepper now. You  can jazz it up with crushed red pepper but I recommend that you have a cast  iron stomach if you do. (I dont!)    I left out an ingredient -- one tomato sauce can full of water! Also, I  used green bell pepper but I suspect that it would be even better with red  bell pepper. Thats what Im going to use next time. I tried it on rice,  even though Jackie says she and her husband just eat it plain with French  bread to sop up the juice.  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #250 by SuzyQ421@aol.com on Sep 18, 1997
