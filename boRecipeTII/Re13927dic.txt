Wine Glazed Oranges
Red wine, Half-and-half, Cloves, Oranges, Grated orange peel (opt), Water, Sugar, Cassia bark, broken in, Piece dried ginger root, 
In a saucepan, combine sugar and water and heat slowly, stirring to  dissolve sugar. Add wine, cloves, cassia bark and ginger. Bring to a boil  and boil until slightly thickened and syrupy. Cool 5 minutes.    Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, peel oranges, removing all bitter white  pith. Cut oranges in 1/4"-thick slices and place in a shallow dish. Strain  wine syrup over oranges. Cover and chill several hours or overnight,  turning slices occasionally in syrup.    Using wooden picks, secure orange slices together to form whole oranges and  place in a serving dish. Pour wine syrup over oranges. Garnish with orange  peel, if desired, and serve with half-and-half.    NOTE: If desired, serve oranges in slices rather than as whole oranges.
