Lemon Ice Cream
Or 2 small lemons (enough, Granulated sugar, Heavy whipping cream, Zest (yellow peel of lemons), 
Grate the zest of lemon directly into an 8inch square glass baking pan. Add  lemon juice, and sugar, and stir until completely blended, 1-3 minutes.    Stir in cream, and stir until throughly mixed and smooth.    Cover dish with foil, freeze until firm, 4 or more hours. Do NOT stir.    Note: I used an 8x8" plastic freezer container, and simply popped the top  on. I believe completely dissolving the sugar is the key to the cream not  curdling.
