Asparagus En Fete
Salt, Capers; drained, Tomatoes; seeded and chopped, Virgin olive oil, LEMON MUSTARD SAUCE, Dijon mustard, Lemon juice, Fresh flat-leaf parsley, Black olives; oil curred, Fresh ground black pepper, Asparagus spears; peeled and, Water; hot tap, 
1.Place the asparagus in no more than two layers in the bottom of a sauce  pan, preferably stainless steel. Add hot tape water, and bring it to a boil  over high heat. Cover the pan, and continue to boil the asparagus over high  heat for 4 to 5 minutes, until it is tender but still firm. Most of the  water will have evaporated.    2.Remove the asparagus from the pan, and spread it out on a platter to  speed cooling. When it is cool enough to handle, measure down 5 inches from  the tip of each spear, and cut off and reserve the remainder of the stem  ends. Then, starting at the bottom of the spears, split the stems in half  lengthwise, stopping when you get to the tips and leaving the heads intact.  Cut the reserved stem ends into 1-inch pieces.    3.For the sauce, combine the Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and  olive oil in a small bowl.    4.At a serving time, mix the 1-inch pieces of asparagus with the olives,  capers, and tomato in a bowl. Arrange four asparagus spears on each plate  so the tips extend to the edge of the plate and the stalks, spread open  where they are cut, connect to create a "frame" around an open area in the  center. Arrange some of the tomato-olive mixture in the center of each  plate, and spoon some sauce over both the spears and the mixture. Sprinkle  with the parsley leaves, and serve.
