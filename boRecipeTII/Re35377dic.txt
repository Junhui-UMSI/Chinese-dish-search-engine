Combine chilies and 1 1/2 cups chicken stock in a medium saucepan over high  heat. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring  twice, or until chilies are soft. Cool slightly. Pour into a blender. Add  tortillas and puree until smooth. Chili mixture should be quite thick, with  just enough liquid to puree. You may need to add a bit of additional stock.    Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. When oil smokes, add  beef cubes and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes or until just  brown. Remove meat with a slotted spoon and set aside.    While oil is still hot, stir in onion and cook for 5 minutes or until well  browned. When brown, add garlic and cumin and cook for 1 minute. Add chili  puree and fry for about 7 minutes or until thick and very dark, stirring  often to keep from scorching.    When thick, add meat, beer, and 4 cups chicken stock, stirring well. Lower  heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until very thick and reduced by  half. Remove from heat and stir in the cinnamon and cilantro bundle. Let  stand, without stirring, for 15 minutes. Remove cinnamon and cilantro and  stir in lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.
