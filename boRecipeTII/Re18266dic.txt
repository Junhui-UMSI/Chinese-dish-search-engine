Venison Summer Sausage
Liquid smoke, Cayenne pepper, Black pepper, Garlic salt, Mustard seed, Peppercorns, Pork sausage, venison, Morton Tender Quick Salt, 
1st. day: Mix well, refigerate (covered) 24 hours.    2nd. day: Repeat above    3rd. day: Repeat above    4th. day: Divide into 5 equal parts (1 1/2# each). Shape into 5 rolls  (12-14" long) You can either back on broiler rack in oven for 8 1/2 hours,  or can use smoker and smoke til done. I have a Gander Mountain brand  electric smoker with the water pan.I used it the last time I made the  sausage and smoked it for 4 hours. Much better tasting than using the oven.  Only problem is that my smoker has no settings, just plugs in. * Keeps 3  weeks in refrigerator, and DO NOT use metal dish for mixing or storing.
