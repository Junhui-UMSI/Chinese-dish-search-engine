Peachy Bread Pudding
Loaf French bread, cut into, 16-ounce can light sliced, Eggs, Egg whites, Sugar, 12-ounce can evaporated skim, Nutmeg, Coconut flavoring, Vanilla, Skim milk, Butter flavoring, Raisins, Cinnamon, 
Preheat oven to 350F.    Place bread cubes in a 3-quart baking dish. (I spray with Pam first). Add  peaches and raisins to bread, mixing gently. In a bowl, combine eggs and  egg whites with sugar and mix well. Add evaporated milk, skim milk, spices  and flavorings, and blend well.    Pour egg mixture evenly over bread, and press bread with fork so it will  soak up liquid (I use my hands). Bake for 30 to 40 minutes. Insert knife  near center; if it comes out clean, its done.    Sauce    2 Tablespoons light margarine 2 Tablespoons flour    1 1/3    cup skim milk 1 Tablespoon rum flavoring    Melt margarine in a small saucepan and add flour and sugar, mixing well.  Add milk, stirring constantly. Cook until mixture comes to a boil; boil 1  minute. Remove from heat and stir in flavoring. Serve over hot bread  pudding.

I would not suggest freezing, as  it is a custard.    A double batch of this can be made in those turkey roaster pans. Reheat at  300F for 20 minutes. We made this for our Garden Club Christmas Boutique  that served 300, and everyone loved it.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #077 by "Kim" <kreese@paradise.net> on Mar  16, 1997
