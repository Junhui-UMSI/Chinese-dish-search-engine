When the dough holds together  (add more water or flour as necessary) turn out onto a floured board  & knead until it is elastic & soft.  Cover & let rest for about 40  minutes.  Roll out as thin as you can without breaking the dough.  Place either on a 17" pizza pan or on a cookie sheet.  Set aside.    PIZZA TOPPINGS: Saute the onion & garlic in the olive oil until the  onions are translucent.  Add the basil & bell peppers & saute for 5  minutes.  Add the shredded tofu & cook 3 minutes or so.  Add the  parsley, tomatoes & olives.  Remove from the heat.  Spread the  vegetables on the pizza crust & sprinkle with the nutritional yeast.  Bake for 5 to 10 minutes at 450F until the crust is golden & the  vegetables are sizzling.    NOTE: The baking time is dependent upon how thick your crust is.  Also, you can use your favourite pizza crust too.    Recipe by Mark Satterly    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/vegan4.zip
