These pretzels  are  absolutely *wonderful* warm from the oven; poaching in a baking soda  solution gives then a wonderfully tangy outside.    NOTE: I used 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2  cup whole wheat flour and 2  tsp wheat  gluten    Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/4 cup of the water.  Combine flours, add  salt; stir in remaining water.  When yeast mixture is foamy, add it to  flour  and mix thoroughly.  Turn out on floured board and let rest 2-3  minutes while  you clean and oil bowl.  Knead 10 minutes, until dough is  silky and resilient, adding more flour if necessary.  Return to bowl, cover  with a double layer of plastic wrap; let rise 1 hour or until doubled in  volume.    Punch down dough.  Cut into 8 pieces (or more, for smaller pretzels)  then  roll each piece into a thin tube 18-24 inches long.  To form a pretzel,  grasp eeach end of the dough, forming a horseshoe with the curved part away  from  you.  Twist the ends around each other and press each firmly onto the  loop  of dough beneath them.  Let pretzels rest 10 minutes under a towel on  a lightly floured board.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.    Simmer a quart of water in a large skillet.  Dissolve baking soda.   Poach  pretzels two or three at a time, 30 seconds on each side.  Remove pretzels,  pat dry, and place on baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal. Sprinkle  pretzels with coarse salt.    Bake 10-12 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Serve warm.
