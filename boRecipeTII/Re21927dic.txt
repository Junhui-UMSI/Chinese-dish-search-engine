Applesauce
Cinnamon, Nutmeg - grated, Bushel basket Staymen, Bushel basket MacIntosh, Delicious Apples peeled and, Brown sugar to taste, 
Wash and half Macs and Winesap and cook until soft in as little water as  possible.  You can do this in pots on the stove (watch for burning) or in  roasting pans in the oven.  Even the microwave will do.    Put through food mill and add brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg grated to  taste.  Add chopped delicious apples if you want chunky style.  Heat to  boiling, stiring occasionally. Pour boiling hot into hot jars leaving 1/2  inch head space.  Remove air bubbles. Adjust caps. Process pints and quarts  20 minutes in a boiling water bath.  Makes a years worth.    Shared By: Pat Stockett    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/kids.zip
