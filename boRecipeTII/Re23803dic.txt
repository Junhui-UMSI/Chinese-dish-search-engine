Asiago Cheese Bread
Yellow cornmeal, Sugar, Romano Cheese, Water, Active dry yeast, Salt, Asiago Cheese, Egg, Bread Flour, 
Place all ingredients in pan of bread machine in order listed, or in the  order recommended for your machine. Set controls for Basic bread with  medium crust and start machine. Makes one 1 1/2-pound loaf.    I created this bread in response to a recent request on this list, and also  because I wanted to make a cheese bread using some of the excellent Asiago  cheese that we sell at our food co-op.  This bread has an *absolutely  wonderful* aroma while its baking.  Ive made it twice and it has already  become my husbands new all-time favorite bread.  Its definitely worth the  extra effort to use freshly grated cheeses.  The cornmeal adds some body  and helps make a crisper crust, but if you cant eat corn, leave it out and  add more flour (start with 1/4 cup flour and add more if needed).    >From: bbriscoe@infolink.morris.mn.us (Bonnie Briscoe)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Bonnie Briscoe
