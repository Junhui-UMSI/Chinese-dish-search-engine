VEGETABLE QUINOA BAKE: Quinoa, the ancient South American grain with a  nutty flavor and chewy texture, teams up with a medley of vegetables for  this casserole. This makes an impressive centerpiece for holiday dinners or  other festive occasions. Jay prepared this dish on "Alive and Wellness," a  cable television show, and it was a big hit.    PREHEAT oven to 400F/200C. In a large saucepan, heat the oil. Add the  onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, if desired, zucchini, and  garlic and saute for about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the water, quinoa,  squash, carrots kale, and seasonings and bring to a boil.    Transfer the mixture to a 9" X 13" casserole dish and cover. Bake for 30 to  40 minutes, until all of the liquid is absorbed.    Remove from the oven and fluff with a fork. Let stand for 5 minutes before  serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
