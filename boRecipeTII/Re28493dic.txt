Terry says she has made her reputation as a great baker on this cake alone.  "I bake this British tea cake every month and many more times during the  Christmas holidays. For those who love a good raisin bread, its that and a  bit more. For those who dont like fruitcake, it serves the occasion  without being sticky and cloyingly sweet--which is most folks complaint  with fruitcake. It packs well, keeps its taste, its pretty, and its  practically foolproof. You can dress it up with icing, or slice it thin,  and have it for breakfast, toasted. It also travels well. I use a long pan,  although a bundt pan works well too."    Soak the raisins, brown sugar, tea, and whiskey in a large bowl for 12  hours or overnight. The next day, sift together the flour, baking powder,  salt, nutmeg, and allspice and add to the raisin mixture along with the  beaten eggs (or egg substitute to make it totally zero cholesterol) and  lemon rind. Set oven at 300oF. Put batter into greased pan, and bake for 90  minutes. When done, remove from pan and let cool on rack. You can leave it  simple, dress it up with icing, or drizzle with a honey-and-warm-water  mixture.
