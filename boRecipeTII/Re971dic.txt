Let rest for 10 min. but do not let  rise. Shape into bagels by pinching off pieces of dough. Roll each piece  into a rope 1/2 inch thick and 6 inches long. Attach ends. Place on a  greased cookie sheet, bruch with yolk-water mixture, and sprinkle with  coarse salt. Bake in a preheated 425 deg. oven for about 20 min. until  golden brown.    Variation: Dough can be rolled into pencil-thin strips, shapped into  pretzel or different letters of the alphabet and baked at 425 deg, for 15  minutes.
