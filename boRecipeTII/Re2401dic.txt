Bill Martins "Awesome Pork Loin Rub"
Chile powder, Sage, Cinnamon, Brown sugar, Salt, Black pepper, 
Put it on the pit at 275 for just over 2hours, using oak, apple and a  little mesquite. This was my first time to use the Polder therm. and it was  great. When the loin reached 135 degrees, I brushed on some Jack Daniels  Grill Glaze Id made, then waited for it to reach 145. Took it off and let  it sit before carving. Nice smoke ring. Juicy and tender. Good smoky  flavor, although (as usual) a bit too subtle for my tastes.    Posted to bbq-digest by Gecrain@aol.com on Nov 17, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.
