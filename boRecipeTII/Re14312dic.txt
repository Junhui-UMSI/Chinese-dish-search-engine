Preheat the oven to 200 C.    Into a blender or food processor put 1 cup milk, 2 thick slices of  crustless white bread cut in quarters, 1 tablespoon butter, 2 egg yolks, 2  cloves garlic, crushed, and salt and pepper to taste. Process to a puree.  Remove to a large basin and fold through 400 g whitebait.    In another basin beat the egg whites until they stand in stiff peaks. Fold  the egg whites through the whitebait mixture and turn into a buttered  souffle dish. Bake for 20 minutes or until risen and golden.
