In food processor or blender,  process rice in two batches with bout 1 cup of soaking liquid per batch  until nearly smooth. Return rice to remaining soaking liquid. Strain  mixture through several layers of cheesecloth or coffee filters. (This  could take as long as an hour.)    Add sugar, rice milk and remaining cinnamon to strained liquid. Refrigerate  until chilled . Before serving, process or shake to thoroughly blend. Makes  8 servings of about 1 cup each.    Helpful Hint: Try making this drink with different varieties of rice.  Jasmine rice, for example, creates a different flavor than basmati or other  rice.
