Pomegranite Tapioca
Pomegranites, -(up to), Sugar, Grenadine syrup, Quick cooking tapioca, Water, 
From: mjfst19@vms.cis.pitt.edu    Date: 14 Sep 95 15:15:01 EDT  This is a delicious way to capture the flavor and color of pomegranites  (one of my favorite fruits).    Peel the pomegranites and remove the seeds (may be easier under running  water).  Briefly run the seeds with some of the water through the blender.  Strain the pulp, pressing on the seeds to extract all the juice.  Run some  water through the strainer and press again.  Add enough water to make 2  cups of liquid. Add a little grenadine syrup to brighten the color and add  more flavor. Add sugar to taste. Pour into a saucepan. Sprinkle the tapioca  over the surface and let sit for 5 minutes. Heat the mixture and simmer  until the tapioca grains are translucent. Serve cold.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
