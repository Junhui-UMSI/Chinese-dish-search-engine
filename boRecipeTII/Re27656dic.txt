The Dons Manicotti Sauce (Lite Version)
Basil; To Taste, (16 Oz) Tomato Puree, Ground turkey, Italian Turkey Sausage;, salt and pepper, Italian Sweet Sausage, Cloves Garlic (Or More To, Oregano; To Taste, (6 Oz) Tomato Paste, Onion, Sugar, 
In a covered Dutch oven, over med. heat, in 1/4 cup water, cook the sausage  links for about 5 min. Then uncover and brown. Drain fat and blot with  paper towels if you want to get as much excess fat off as possible. Do the  same with the ground turkey, although the fat should be considerably less.  Set aside.    In large (5 qt) Dutch oven or stockpot (nonstick, if possible), heat a few  tsp of olive oil and saute onion and garlic a few min. until soft. Add all  remaining ingredients, except meat, together in the Dutch oven (or  stockpot). Add 1 cup water. Simmer covered about 1 hour. Cut sausage into  bite size pieces and add to pot along with turkey. Gently simmer at least  another 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Do not let thicken too much. Slight  additions of water at this stage will not hurt.    Suggested Wine: Full bodied red    Serving Ideas : Any cheese filled pasta    NOTES : The quantities of meat & sausages are very adjustable!  The  original recipe called for 1lb.  Italian sweet sausage and 1 lb. ground  beef (which is VERY HEAVY I think).  For a spicier version, hot italian  sausage may be used. The seasonings are also very adjustable to taste, of  course!  The original recipe only called for 1 clove of garlic (for garlic  lovers-ridiculous!)  Recipe by: Don Michel    Posted to recipelu-digest by Terry Pogue <tpogue@idsonline.com> on Feb 24,  1998
