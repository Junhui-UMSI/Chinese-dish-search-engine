Gypsy Potatoes
Potatoes Red Bliss #2;, Oil or "red fat", Caraway seed, Butter, Salt and pepper, 
* Heat the oil in a roasting pan in a 400 degree F oven.    * Add the small peeled potatoes, and roast about an hour, till they are  well browned and crisp on the outside, and tender inside. Be sure to shake  the pan a few times during the process to brown potatoes evenly.    * Add the caraway seeds and butter, shake well to coat potatoes with butter  and seeds, season with salt and pepper.    Red Fat is stock fat from brown stock that has had paprika, onions and  garlic cooked with it. It is often strained from goulash.    Mixed with ground onions and garlic,it gives a wonderful flavor to roasting  chickens, potatoes, etc. I also use it in making chopped liver.    Notes: Goes well with roasted and braised meats.
