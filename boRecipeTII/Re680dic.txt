Put all ingredients in large baking bowl or pan. Cover. Bake for 4-5 hours  at 350 degrees. You can bake it for 8 hours or so if you decrease the  temperature on the oven to 300. Stir well and serve. This is very versatile  as you can serve it with steamed veggies and rice or noodles or roasted  potatoes. We used to heap it into baked potatoes. It really is delicious!
