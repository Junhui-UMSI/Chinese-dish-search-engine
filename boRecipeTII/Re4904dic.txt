Pickled Eggs (Basic)
Yellow peppers, waxed, Onions, Eggs, Vinegar, white, Water, 
Hard boil eggs.  Slice onions very thinly.  Combine water and vinegar in  LARGE container (not plastic). Stir well. Peel eggs, and layer in jar with  sliced onions and peppers. Cover jar and let marinate on counter. DO NOT  REFRIGERATE. Eggs will get spicier the longer you leave them in marinade.  Minimum time is about one week - maximum time is as long as you wish. When  you dont want them to marinate any longer, remove them from jar and place  in container without any liquid.
