Bake according to your machine's directions using French or Basic cycle.  This is a low rising bread due to the lack of oil and small amount of sugar.  Keep an eye on the dough and add a tablespoon or so of water if the dough  looks dry or if the machine sounds like its struggling. (the above notes  are from the book.) SOURCE: The Bread Machine Cookbook by Donna Rathmell  German Formatted by Carol Kaplan ACGR23B for Prodigy Food BB 5/9/97  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Jack Elvis <jackelvis@moonlink.net> on Oct  04, 1998
