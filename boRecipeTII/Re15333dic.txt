This is a sturdy soup that makes a meal in itself. Itis popular in northern  Italy, especially Tuscany. You may substitute other dried beans such as  garbanzo, white kidney beans or cannellini beans. Garnish with croutons if  desired.    Soak the beans in lots of water for at least three hours. Drain.    Cook the onioin, carrot and celry in heated oil for about 10 minutes or  until soft. Add garlic and rosemary and cook for 3 minutes. Add the beans  and stock, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until tender --  about an hour and a half. Cool slightly.    Place one-third of the bean mixture in a blender or processor and puree  until smooth. Return to soup and reheat. Adjust seasonings.    Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with cheese and parsely and serve at  once.
