Italian Chicken Dinner
From: Judy Garnett PJXG05A, Sm Cabbage; cut in wedges, Mushrooms; canned, Tapioca; quick cooking, Chicken; broiler or fryer -, And frozen, Parmesan cheese, Jar Meatless spaghetti sauce, 
In a 3 1/2 to 6 quart crockery cooker place cabbage wedges, onion and  mushrooms.  Sprinkle tapioca over vegetables. Place FROZEN chicken pieces  atop vegetables. Pour spaghetti sauce over chicken. Cover; cook on low-heat  setting for 10 to 12 hours.  Transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle with  Parmesan Cheese. Makes 6 servings.    Notes from Gaye:  The original recipe did not indicate the amount of onion  to use.  I used 1/4 cup dried chopped onion (equivalent to one onion). I  used 1 cup of Ragu Garden Style with Tomatoes, Garlic and Onions. Also, I  used fresh, skinned chicken n breasts.
