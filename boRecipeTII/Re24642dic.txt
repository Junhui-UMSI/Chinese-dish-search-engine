Ass Kickin Beer Barbecue Sauce
Worcestershire Sauce, Water, Brown sugar, Beer, Onion, Mustard, Tabasco sauce, Habanero Pepper, Vinegar, Garlic, Juice of 1/2 lemon, Butter, Pepper, Chili Sauce, 
In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in butter. When the onions  are transparent add the remainder of ingredients. Bring to a boil. Simmer  until your grill is ready, about 10 to 15 minutes or until you cant stand  the wonderful smell of the sauce any longer.    Now let me tell you, this is what I call barbecue sauce. (The habanero may  be left out if youre a wimp.)    Will keep for two weeks or so in the fridge.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #241 by roy@indy.net (Roy) on Sep 11, 1997
