With Christmas soon upon us I thought it would be nice to post some of my  favorite cheesecakes all taken from my Simply Delicious cooking 2 cookbook.    Have fun, Chef K    Crust: Combine the ingredients. Press into a buttered 9" spring form pan.  Refrigerate 5 minutes, then bake for 7 minutes in a 350 F (180 C) preheated  oven. Cool.    Filling: Cream the cheese with the sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Stir in the vanilla. Divide the batter into 3 parts. Blend the banana into  one part. Blend the strawberry into a second part, and the chocolate and  cocoa into the third part.    Pour the chocolate batter into the shell, bake for 25 minutes. Carefully  pour the banana batter over the chocolate and bake for an additional 25  minutes. Pour the strawberry batter over and bake for 30 minutes. Turn oven  off, prop the door open and leave the cake in for 30 additional minutes.  Transfer to a cooling rack, cool to room temperature. Chill in refrigerator  for 8 hours or overnight. Serve with chocolate sauce.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by RKalenuik <RKalenuik@AOL.COM> on Dec 10, 1997
