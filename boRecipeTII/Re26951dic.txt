FOR SAUCE: In a two quart heavy sauce pan, melt butter over medium high  heat. Saute onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic and bay leaves until  vegetables are wilted, approximately three to five minutes. Add tomato  sauce and fish stock, bring to a low boil, reduce to simmer and cook thirty  minutes, stirring occasionally. Add sugar, thyme, basil, green onions and  parsley. Continue to cook ten additional minutes and season to taste using  salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside. FOR COOKING: Preheat oven  to 375 degrees F. Place catfish fillets in an ovenproof casserole dish  large enough to hold the four fillets. Sprinkle the shrimp evenly over the  top of the fillets. Spoon the Creole sauce generously until fish and shrimp  are well covered. Place covered baking dish in oven and cook approximately  thirty minutes or until fish is done. Heat rice under hot tap water and  place an equal amount in the center of each serving plate. Serve catfish  Creole on top of white rice and garnish with chopped parsley. This dish may  also be served over pasta.
