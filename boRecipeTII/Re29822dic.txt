About 6 to 8 T peanut oil for stir-frying PREPARATION: Shred in 2" lengths:  carrots, turnip, Chinese celery and beancurd. Shred onions, greens & all,  into 2" lengths. Rinse, then soak in hot water: enough mushrooms, fungus  and lily flowers to give specified amounts. Shred mushrooms, chop fungus.  Soak bean thread noodles.  Bean thread noodles are important because they  soak up excess moisture from the vegetables. Vegetables should be moist but  not soggy or watery after stir-frying. STIR-FRYING: Stir-fry fresh  vegetables separately with about 1 tablespoon oil for each, in hot wok. Add  salt to taste.  Drain off excess water, reserve. (Soybean sprouts should be  cooked until they are slightly charred for fullest flavor.) To stir-fry  dried soaked ingredients, begin with hot wok, add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil,  then add mushroom, fungus & lily flowers. Stir-fry green onions, add all  other ingredients to them, including noodles. Allow dish to cool before  serving. NOTE:  Fresh or canned bamboo shoot may be substituted for any  vegetable. Seaweed may be used instead of some of the fungus.
