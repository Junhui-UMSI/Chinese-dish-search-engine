1. Combine the flour, baking soda, spices, and salt.    2. In a large saucepan, bring the honey to a boil. Remove from the heat and  beat in the brown sugar. Beat in the egg. Beat in the lemon juice and zest.  Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Fold in the candied citron and  almonds. Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover, and chill for 24 hours.    3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    4. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out cookies and place 2 inches  apart on ungreased baking sheets. Place the cherry halves on top of each  cookie.    5. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly colored. Transfer to wire racks  to cool.    Baking Notes: Traditionally these are frosted with white icing and  decorated with almonds and cherries.
