Shred red cabbage rather fine and sprinkle generously with salt. Set aside  in a cool place to stand for 30 hours. Drain all moisture from cabbage, and  then place it in the sun, allowing to remain for several hours. Use  sufficient vinegar to cover the cabbage, adding 1 cup of sugar to every  gallon of vinegar, and a small quantity of each of the spices. Boil this  together for 7 minutes and pour over the cabbage. Put in stone jars, cover  and store in a cool place.
