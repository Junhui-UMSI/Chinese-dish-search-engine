Avocado Sauce for Pasta
Ground Coriander, Salt, Orange Peel, Avocados, Butter, Lemon Peel, Black Pepper, Spring Onions, Plain Yoghurt, Single Cream, 
* shallots work just as well, although you need more ** we really like  coriander, so we put in a couple of teaspoons    Melt butter in a saucepan, add spring onions and stir-fry 1 minute. Then  add orange and lemon peel and coriander. Remove from the heat while you  prepare cream and yoghurt. Pour cream into a small bowl and add yoghurt,  salt and pepper. Mix well until smooth. Peel, stone and chop avocados (the  size you chop the pieces is personal preference, but we usually chop into  about 1.5 cm cubes).  Add the avocado to the ingredients in the pan, pour  yoghurt mixture over and very gently heat through. DO NOT BOIL or avocados  will become soggy and sauce will curdle.  Pour over pasta, toss and serve  at once.    Note:  This sauce can be started in advance but the avocados should not be  added until the last minute.    For the two of us for dinner, we halve all of the ingredients, and use one  medium to large sized avocado.    Recipe By     : jodis@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au (Jodi Steel)
