1.  Combine the onions, celery and garlic on a cutting board and chop  together very finely.    2.  Heat the olive oil in a 3 to 4-quart saucepan.  Add the chopped  vegetables, basil and a few grindings of pepper.  Cook over moderate heat,  stirring frequently, 8 to 10 minutes.    3. Add the wine and boil briskly to reduce the mixture to about 1/4 cup.  Add the tomatoes and simmer uncovered about 20 minutes over low heat.    4.  Add the mussels, cover the pan and cook a few minutes longer.  Discard  any that remain closed. Serve immediately.    NOTE:  The soup can be made ahead and warmed over medium heat.  Do not make  more than 1 day in advance.  Be sure to scrub the mussels well, so as to  remove all of the beards.  Garnish with lemon peel.    DEL MONDO RISTORANTE    N.
