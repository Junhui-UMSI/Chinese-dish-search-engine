>From Esquire Magazine, 1986:    I have made the recipe a couple of times and both times with very good  results. The finished dish is a spicy lamb dish that is quite exquisite. Be  warned that this recipe takes quite a bit of effort to put together.    Method: Cut lamb into 3/4 " cubes.    Place lamb and the bones in a non-metallic bowl with the four tablespoons  of oil, the vinegar, tamarind pulp, and salt. Let it marinate at room  temperature for eight hours or, refrigerated, for 24 hours.    Put two tablespoons of oil, the onion, garlic, and ginger in an electric  blender or food processor and run the machine until a fine pasty puree is  formed.    Heat the one-half cup of vegetable oil in a large enamel coated skillet  over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until they are caramel  brown, stirring constantly to prevent burning.    Add the puree. Reduce the heat and add ground cumin, ground mustard,  turmeric, red pepper, and paprika. When the spices begin to sizzle and turn  dark, in about 15 seconds, add the lamb and bones. Cook until slightly  seared (about ten minutes).    Add the water and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer,  partially covered, until the meat is very tender (about thirty minutes).  Pick out and discard bones. Serve over rice.    Posted to rec.food.recipes by hz225wu@unidui.uni-duisburg.de (Micaela  Pantke) on Thu, 12 Aug 93.
