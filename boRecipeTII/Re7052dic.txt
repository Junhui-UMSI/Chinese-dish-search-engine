Preheat popover pan in oven about 2 minutes.  Blend flour, salt, eggs, milk  and melted butter until the mixture is the consistency of heavy cream,  about 1 to 2 minutes. Place 1 small piece of butter in each cup and place  pans back in the oven until butter is bubbly - about 1 minute. Fill each  cup half-full with batter and bake about 20 minutes. Reduce temperature to  300=A1 and continue baking 20 minutes. Makes 6 popovers. NOTES:    Popover batter can be mixed in a food processor, blender, electric mixer or  hand mixer.    The batter can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator.  It  should be used at room temperature.    Popovers are best right from the oven.  Serve with butter, jams or other  sweet or savory spreads.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
