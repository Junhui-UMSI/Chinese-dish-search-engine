To give you something to play with until the next installent, try this.  This is the most basic bread recipe. Most of the time I use this and change  it as I please. [Berner]    Put flour into large bowl. Stir yeast with warm water in small bowl. (If  the water is cold, the    yeast will not grow. If the water is too hot, the yeast will die.). Add  salt. Mix with flour and KNEAD! Let raise until size doubles. Make two  loafs and place on cookie sheet. Let raise again briefly. Bake at middle  heat in preheated oven. Baking time is 40 to 70 minutes.
