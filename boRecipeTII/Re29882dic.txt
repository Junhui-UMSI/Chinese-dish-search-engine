1. Using a meat pounder, lightly flatten the chicken breasts. In a large  shallow dish, combine the lime zest and 1 tbs of the lime juice with the  tequila and garlic. Add the chicken and turn to coat with the marinade; set  aside for 10 minutes.    2. In a food processor, finely grind the almonds. Do not over-process or  the nuts will form a paste. Transfer to a large plate. Add the cumin and  =AB tsp salt and toss well.    3. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 1 tbs lime juice with the chile,  shallot and 1 tsp olive oil. With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the  tomatoes and avocado.    4. Remove the garlic slices from the chicken marinade. Pat the almond  mixture on both sides of each breast half to coat thoroughly.    5. In a large non-stick skillet, melt 1 tbs of the butter in =AB tbs of the  olive oil over high heat. Add 2 of the chicken breast halves, reduce the  heat to moderate and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 5  minutes. Turn the chicken and cook until browned on the second side and  cooked through, 3-4 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to plates and wipe  out the skillet. Repeat with the remaining butter, oil and chicken. Season  the tomato-avocado salad with salt and pepper, spoon it over the chicken  and serve.    Food and Wine September 1995
