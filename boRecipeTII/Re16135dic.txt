Use  slotted spoon to transfer bacon to paper towels. Pour off any excess bacon  fat from pan but do not wipe pan out. Add oil, red wine vinegar, balsamic  vinegar, water, mustard, sugar, salt, pepper, cranberry juice and  cranberries to pan. Bring to simmer and stir until well mixed. (Can be made  several hours ahead to this point and kept at room temperature or  refrigerated overnight.) To serve, heat dressing in pan over medium heat.  When hot, add onion slices, separating slices into rings. Remove from heat.  Place spinach leaves in large bowl and pour hot dressing over salad. Toss  well to coat spinach with dressing. Adjust seasoning. Divide among 6  plates, arranging a few onions and cranberries over surface. Sprinkle bacon  over, dividing evenly.  Serve immediately. 285 cal; 27 gr fat; 85% fat.
