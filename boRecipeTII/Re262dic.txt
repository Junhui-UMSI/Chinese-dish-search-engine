My sister gave me a wonderful cookbook a few years ago for my birthday -  Designed for Living: Quick, Healthy and Delicious Recipes/ Corning  Cookbook. Ive adapted their recipe for the latkes.    Squeeze excess moisture from zucchini by wringing it in paper towels or a  clean tea towel that hasnt been bleached. Combine all ingredients, except  butter and mix well. Melt 2 tbs. butter in skillet, ladle in batter to make  pancakes. When nicely browned on one side, flip pancakes over and brown on  other side. Serves 4-6.    Ive never made it this way; I always make it parve, so no cheese, no  butter. I also dont use the mayo or oregano, but oregano or basil or thyme  would probably add more zing. I use cake or matzo meal instead of flour (it  tastes much better!), and sometimes grate a potato into the batter. I also  dont measure. 2 eggs is too many; and 1/4 cup matzo meal is probably not  enough; Id guess that 1/3 - 1/2 cup is better. If you make this, youll  find the right consistency while youre mixing. Also, thats a pretty fancy  way of draining the excess moisture. You should be able to pour it out, or  compensate with the matzo meal and conserve the vitamins. I made this kugel  for one of the Rosh Hashanah meals to accompany a roast.
