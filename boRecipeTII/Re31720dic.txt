Marinate the fish in the remaining ingredients for 2 to 3 hours at  room temperature. Grill over medium coals for 5 minutes a side until medium  rare, grill longer for well done. Serve with Fruit Salsa.    Fruit Salsa: Fruit salsa brings out all the wonderful flavors of summer.  This is a great garnish and flavor builder for grilled fish or chicken.  Serves 2 to 4 as a garnish depending on the portions used.  Mix all  ingredients together and chill at least one hour before serving.
