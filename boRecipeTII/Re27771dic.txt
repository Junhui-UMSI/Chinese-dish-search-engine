The Punchbowl
Cranberry juice, Ginger ale, 1 bottle, Cold water, Pineapple juice, frozen, Bottles 7-Up, Banana, Lemonade, frozen concentrate, Orange juice, frozen, Strawberries, frozen, Club soda, 1 bottle, 
* All frozen concentrates are to be thawed partially. ** Use as much 7-UP  or equal amounts of other soft drinks to make the punch to your taste.    1. Using a blender, blend the juices a little at a time, pouring into large  punchbowl or other large container. Blend the banana and strawberries only  until coarse blended, not pureed. Mix the ice water in the punch bowl with  other ingredients and stir to blend. 2. Just before serving, add the club  soda, ginger ale and enough 7-Up to suit your taste. Stir gently to mix all  juices from the sediment on bottom of bowl. Serve this as is or over ice.    Serving Ideas : Serve this at any occasion for a non-alcoholic punch.    NOTES : You may wish to make an ice ring to float in this for a decorative  and festive touch. Using a ring mold, freeze a shallow layer of water, put  fruits in a pattern on top of ice, pour a thin layer of water, refreeze.  Repeat these steps until you have built up the ice ring and made several  layers of fruit designs. Unmold the ring and place in punch bowl just  before serving. Use juice instead of water for ice ring if you wish.
