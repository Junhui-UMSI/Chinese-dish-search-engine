Drain and rinse with cold water, and drain  again.    Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 3/4-inch strips.  Spray a cold, large  non-stick skillet with cooking spray, add the chicken and cook over  medium-high heat just until tender and no longer pink (about 4 minutes)  turning the pieces occasionally.    Drain the mushrooms.  Cut up the tomatoes but remember to save the juice.  In a saucepan, combine the tomatoes and juice, the drained mushrooms,  tomato sauce, wine, cornstarch, bouillon granules, garlic, and basil. Cook  and stir over medium-high heat until the mixture thickens and is bubbly.  Cook and stir for another 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the chicken  and the onions.    Spoon the pasta to one side of 4 individual shallow baking dishes*.  Spoon  the tomato-chicken mixture on the other side.  Cover with clear plastic  wrap and then foil. Seal, label, and freeze.    *Use microwave-safe dishes if the casseroles will be reheated in the  microwave.    RE-HEATING: Conventional oven:  Remove plastic wrap.  Cover with foil. Bake  frozen casserole, covered, in a 375=B0 F. oven for 1 hour or until heated  through.  Microwave oven:  Remove foil.  Cover with vented plastic wrap or  wax paper. Cook on 70% power (medium-high) for 9 minutes (1 serving) or  16-18 minutes (2 servings) or until heated through, turning the dishes  once.    Digest eat-lf.v096.n123    From the EAT-LF recipe list.
