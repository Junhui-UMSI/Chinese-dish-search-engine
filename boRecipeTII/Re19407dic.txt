Vegetarian "Chicken" Broth
Salt, Tumeric, black pepper, garlic, parsley, Water, Carrots, Onions, Scallions, 
I made this for our seder to serve with matzoh balls and no one even missed  the chicken! This is based on Mollie Katzens "Not-Chicken Soup" (from her  "Still Life with Menu" ) with a few changes. She suggests adding a peeled  parsnip (which I didnt have) and a handful of mushrooms (which I loathe).  This is how I did it and it came out fantastic!    1. Combine everything in a large soup pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat  to simmer, partially cover.    2. Cook slowly for about 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the heat and let cool to  room temperature. Strain the vegetables through a sieve. Leave as is if you  want a clear broth or press the vegetables through the seive for a cloudy  but more robustly flavored broth.    3. Serve with matzoh balls, refrigerate, or freeze.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Melisa Crosby & Will Underwood  <melcro@vr-net.com> on Apr 12, 1998
