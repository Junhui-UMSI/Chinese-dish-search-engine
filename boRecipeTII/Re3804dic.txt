Pennsylvania Dutch Molasses Cookies
Ginger, Molasses, Egg, Soda, Hot water, all-purpose flour, Lard, 
Place molasses in a large bowl, add soda which has been dissolved in water  and melted lard. Mix well. Add slightly beaten eggs, sifted flour and  ginger. Beat well. If dough seems to sticky & soft can add more flour  enough to make a stiffer batter. Chill well. Roll out on a floured board,  very thin, and cut into animal shapes (or use a round cutter). Bake 350 F.  10-15 minutes. 5 dozen very soft cookies. I make them big and cut them a  little thicker.
