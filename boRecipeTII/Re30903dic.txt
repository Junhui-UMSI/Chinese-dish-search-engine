Trim and discard tough spinach stems. Rinse leaves and pat dry. Tear into  bite-sized pieces. Layer the sprouts, water chestnuts and spinach into your  salad bowl (in that order, so that the spinach leaves wont get sorry from  being underneath the water chestnuts.) On top of the spinach leaves, add  the crumbled bacon and the chopped egg. Cover and refrigerate.    Combine all the dressing ingredients in a jar or bowl. Shake, or blend well  with a wire whip.    Just before serving, pour dressing over the salad and toss well. Sprinkle  on toasted sesame seeds and toss again.    Note: To toast sesame seeds, place in a small, heavy, ungreased skillet  over medium-high heat. Toast until you hear the seeds begin to pop, shaking  the pan to keep the seeds from scorching.
