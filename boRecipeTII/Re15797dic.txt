About Milkweed Blossoms
Milkweed buds, Boiling water, Butter; to taste, 
Unopened buds are delicious when cooked but must be treated first to remove  bitterness.  Put them in a pot, pour on boiling water, boil one minute,  drain, and pour on more boiling water. Repeat this process three times or  until no bitterness remains when you taste them. Cook them a little longer  until just tender and serve with butter.
