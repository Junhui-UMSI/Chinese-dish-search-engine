Add the mascarpone  and continue to beat until smooth.    2.  Whip the egg whites until frothy and gradually add the white sugar.  Continue to beat until they are quite stiff.    3.  Dip the ladyfingers, one by one and quickly or they will get soggy, in  the coffee and put a single layer in the bottom of the pan.    4.  Pour half the cheese mixture over the ladyfingers and sprinkle half of  the grated chocolate.    5.  Repeat 3 and 4, using the rest of the ladyfingers, cheese and  chocolate.    6.  Chill for 4 - 6 hours and enjoy!!! VARIATION: When strawberries are in  season, this is a wonderful variation:          1    quart of fresh strawberries          2    tablespoons white sugar        1/4    cup brandy Wash, hull and thickly slice the berries. Pour the  sugar and brandy over them and let them sit while you are mixing the cheese  and grating the chocolate. To assemble, put a layer of ladyfingers as above  and then a layer of strawberries, a layer of cheese and chocolate. Repeat  this once.  You might want to use a larger pan if you are using berries. I  know from experience that 9 x 13 is not quite large enough. Other berries,  i.e.  raspberries, or cherries would also be good although I havent tried  them.  This makes a large dessert and is great for potlucks or dinner  parties.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
