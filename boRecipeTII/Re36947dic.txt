Heat  the milk with the sugar just to boiling in a heavy saucepan. Remove from  the heat. Stir in the cornstarch mixture. Return to heat. Cook, stirring,  until the mixture thickens. Simmer 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.  Add the vanilla and the egg yolks. Whisk until almost cold. Cover. Chill.    Prepare the trifle: Cut the cake into even slices. Spread each with jam and  reassemble the cake. Cut into 2" cubes. Arrange the cubes in individual  bowls. Sprinkle with cream sherry. Wash and slice the strawberries. Set a  few strawberries aside for garnish. Divide the strawberries among the  individual bowls. Pour the custard over the strawberries and cake in the  bowls. Drizzle with a little strawberry jam. Cover each bowl. Chill. Whip  the cream until soft peaks form. Add the sugar and vanilla. Garnish each  trifle with some sliced strawberries. Top with whipped cream. Chill  briefly.  Serve.
