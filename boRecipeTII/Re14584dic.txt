"Instant" Sorbet
Peaches, juice-packed, 
Take a can of juice-packed peaches or pineapple. Freeze it for several  hours.  (Thats right, just put the can in the freezer!) Open and dump  frozen contents into food processor with metal chopping blade in place or  into a blender.  Process until desired consistency. Enjoy!    Note: You can also do this with frozen bananas.  I find this is a good way  to use them this time of year when they get over-ripe so quickly. Freeze  them* in "zip-lock" type bags - peeling them when frozen can give you  frostbite!  They end up very creamy--like very rich ice cream...but with no  added fat,sugar, etc... *w/o peels
