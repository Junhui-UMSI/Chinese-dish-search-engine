(from: owlsprng@iol.ie (Diane Duane), chile-heads, 25Apr96)    This is the recipe I use for it when the season comes around...which is  about now. Those of our neighbors who raise dairy goats are suddenly faced  with about 50% billy kids which they dont need and cant use. Most of them  make their way to specialty butchers and high-priced restaurants in Dublin.  But they have to get past *me* first.  :)    The recipe is from the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, Tessin or  Ticino. (It also works brilliantly with lamb.)    Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces. Sprinkle the meat with the salt and  pepper. Heat the butter in a casserole, and add the sage, juniper berries,  (chilies,) mint, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3  mins. Add meat and brown on all sides. Lower heat and add wine. Simmer,  covered, until meat is tender (it took me a little more than an hour with  the kid I had).    Remove meat and keep warm. Strain the sauce. Put the sauce back in the  casserole, and stir in the cream and rum. Bring to a boil and reduce to the  consistency of heavy cream. Return the meat to the sauce and heat through.  Serve with dry boiled rice and green peas. (it says here: but I served it  with wide homemade egg noodles, and I think that works better than rice  would, even if not strictly the way they would do it in Locarno.)    Naturally you could add fresh green or red chilies to this mixture as well.  Steeping them in the rum first might be an interesting thought.
