Vincent Prices French Toast Santa Fe
Salt, Maple syrup, Nutmeg, Eggs, Bread, Vegetable oil, Powdered sugar, Cream, 
Preheat oven to hot (400F). Use bread that is very dry -- 2 or 3 days old.  Cut 3 slices of bread, 3/4 inch thick. Trim crusts and cut across  diagonally to make 6 triangles. In a bowl, beat eggs until light and  frothy. Add cream, salt and nutmeg. Soak bread, a few pieces at a time so  they absorb egg-cream mixture thoroughly. In skillet, heat 1/4 cup cooking  oil. Fry bread on both sides until golden. Remove bread and drain on paper  towel to absorb any grease. Place on baking sheet and allow to puff up in  the hot oven for 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with sugar; serve with maple  syrup. Serves 2.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Crane C. Walden" <cranew@foothill.net> on Feb  7, 1998
