Pierogi Part 1/2
Flour, Water, Eggs, Salt, 
Mound flour on kneading board and make hole in center. Drop eggs into  hole and cut into flour with a knife. Add salt and water and knead  until firm. Let rest for 10 minutes covered with a warm bowl. Divide  dough in halves and roll thin. Cut circles with a large biscuit  cutter. Place a small mound of filling a little to one side on each  round of dough. Moisten edge with a little water, fold over and press  edges firmly together. Be sure they are well sealed to prevent the  filling from running out. Drop the pierogi into salted boiling water.  Cook gently for for 3 to 5 minutes. Lift out of water carefully with  a perforated spoon.    The dough has a tendency to dry while you are working. A dry dough  will not seal completely. We suggest rolling out a large circle of  dough, placing small mounds of filling far enough apart to allow for  cutting, and folding the dough over the mounds of filling. Then cut  with a small biscuit cutter and seal firmly.    Never crowd or pile pierogi. The uncooked will stick and the cooked  will lose shape and lightness.    Note: Pierogi can be frozen after boiling and they keep well. I  perfer all my pierogi fried in butter and onions and seasoned with  salt and pepper. They should be fried on a medium low heat till  golden brown.
