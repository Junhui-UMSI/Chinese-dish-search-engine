DIRECTIONS: This recipe is made-to-order for Panasonic 65. Convert as  necessary to use in other machines.    Place ingredients in baking kettle as listed, with the exception of the  yeast, which should be placed in the dispenser. Set on Rapid Rise Cycle or        3    hour cycle.    The Barley Malt Liquid is used in place of other liquid sweetener such as  molasses or honey.  The gluten is added so that the loaf will rise higher  than it would with Whole Wheat Flour alone, and the Lecithin is added for  texture and tenderness of crumb. Be sure to use Quick-Rise yeast for this  particular recipe to assure a good rise. It has a nice crust and elastic  texture, is easy to slice.    This makes a 1-1/2 loaf for the Panasonic 65 - appx 7.5 long x 4.5 wide x  7.5-7.75 high, 1-1/2 lb loaf. Have tested it several times and turns out  fine each time.
