Artichoke Preparation: Cut the stems and most of the leaves off the  artichoke. With a paring knife, whittle off the leaves at the base to  expose the heart. Scrape the fibrous "choke" to leave only the disk-shaped  heart.  Rub the heart with lemon. Cook with salted boiling water for about  8 minutes.  Drain and refresh with cold water. Set aside. Bearnaise Sauce:  In a heavy saucepan, combine wine, tarragon vinegar, shallots, fresh  tarragon and white pepper.  Boil to reduce to 3 tablespoons. Let cool.  Meanwhile, melt the butter; cool slightly. Add egg yolks to vinegar mixture  and cook over low heat, whisking constantly, for 1 minute or until the  consistancy of mayonnaise. Do not overcook or it will curdle. Whisk in the  warm melted butter in a thin stream into the wine mixture. The sauce will  thicken. Whisk in salt, cayenne and white pepper to taste. Keep warm in a  pan of warm water. Poach the 4 eggs 3 minutes in 2 quarts of water and 1  tablespoon wine vinegar. Remove with a slotted spoon and trim edges. Keep  in warm water. To assemble, heat the artichoke hearts and blot dry. Spoon a  bit of the Bearnaise Sauce into each heart. Place a poached egg on top and  spoon more sauce over. Serve at once.
