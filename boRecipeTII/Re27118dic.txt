Zucchinis, Parsley, Tomatoes, Garlic, Eggplants, Salt, olive oil, White onions, 
I just saw this southern french recipe on TV5 a minute ago and, since I was  going to type it down, thought I should share it with you. (SAINT-TROPEZ  RECIPES ON TV5)    in an oven-proof dish, place the vegetables which should be cut (not  peeled) in round thin slices , but not too thin (1,5 cm). place first in  the dish 2 rows of zucchinis which you dont lay flat, but on the side,  then add 2 rows of tomatos, then next to the tomatoes the eggplants and  then the onions (if the slices are too large, cut the onions and re-cut  each half so that all the vegetables have about the same height), do a  second and third round or more according to the size of your dish, but  always respecting the order 1)zucchinis, 2) tomatos, 3) eggplants 4)  onions.    By then, it looks so beautiful and colourful its almost a shame to cook  it...but,    mince very thinly (do not press!!!) garlic add the parsley and mince both  together put this mix on the vegetables.    spread olive oil to taste (the more, the tastier...)    put the dish in the pre-heated oven at 200 degrees (very high but not the  maximum) let it cook for 40-45 mn.    I intend to try it tonight...I might apologize tomorrow, but I think it  could be an easy side dish to lamb cutlets...  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by romy@worldcom.ch on May 13, 1998
