Apple Bulgur Breakfast
Cup natural yogurt, Fromage frais;, Milk;, Dried apple rings;, Heaped bulgur;, A little artifical sweetener, 
Mix the apple and bulgur in a bowl, then stir in the yogurt or formage  frais and half the milk.  Cover and set aside for 30 minutes, or  until the bulgur is softened and swollen.  The grain should stillhave  some bite, although it can be left covered in the refrigerator  overnight.  Stir well and add extra milk necessary to make the  mixture creamy.  The mixture can be sweetened with artificial  sweetener if liked.    Very the fruit, if you like, or add fresh fruit to the plain soaked  bulgar.    Food Exchanges were not listed.
