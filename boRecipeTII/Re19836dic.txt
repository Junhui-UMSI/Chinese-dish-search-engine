SERVES 6-8 AS A VEGETABLE DISH      This is more typical of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking than anything else.  The apples add a sweetness to the harsh taste of that old lifesaver,  cabbage. This dish works well as an accompaniment to most meals.      Heat a large Dutch oven and saute the bacon until clear. Add the onions  and saute until they barely begin to brown. Add the remaining ingredients  and cook, covered, stirring often, until all is tender.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
