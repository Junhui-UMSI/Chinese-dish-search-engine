red food color, Egg white, Water, Peppermint extract, Powdered sugar, Granulated sugar, Gelatin, Cornstarch, Corn syrup, Water, Baking Powder, 
Prepare rectangular pan, 13 x9 x 2", with aluminum foil.  Spray foil with  cooking spray; coat with cornstarch mixture.  Mix cornstarch and powdered  sugar.  Shake excess cornstarch mixture from pan and reserve.  Sprinkle  gelatin on 1/2 cup cold water in small bowl to soften.  Heat sugar, corn  syrup, and 1/2 cup water to boiling in 2-quart saucepan, stirring  constantly, just until small granulated sugar is dissolved.  Cook, without  stirring, to 250 on a candy thermometer or until small amount of mixture  dropped into very cold water forms a ball that holds its shape but is  pliable; remove from heat.  Stir in gelatin mixture until gelatin is  dissolved.  Beat egg white and baking powder in medium bowl until stiff  peaks form.  Continue beating on high speed while pouring hot syrup in a  thin stream into egg white.  Add peppermint extract and food color.  Beat  on high speed until soft peaks form.  Pour into pan and spread evenly. Let  stand uncovered at room temperature about 1 1/2 hours or until top is dry.  Turn out onto flat surface generously dusted with reserved cornstarch  mixture and remove foil.  Cut into about 1" squares with long knife dipped  into cold water.  Roll squares in cornstarch mixture to coat all sides.  Drizzle with melted vanilla candy coating tinted with paste food color, if  desired.  Let stand uncovered on wire rack about 1 hour or until dry. Store  in airtight container at room temperature up to 3 weeks.
