Beef Tourtiere (French Canadian Meat Pie)
Onion, Vegetable oil, Pastry pie shells, Allspice, Cinnamon, potatoes, ground beef, salt and pepper, Garlic salt, 
COMMENTS: The large quantity of potatoes and modest amount of seasonning  seems to reduce the beef flavor. We vote for a little less potato and an  extra pinch of spice. Boil potatoes and mash coarsely. Heat oil in large,  heavy duty frying pan and brown beef and onion. Stir in potatoes, allspice,  cinnamon, garlic salt, salt and pepper. Preheat oven to 400F.. Line two  9-inch pie pans with pastry. Using slotted spoon, fill pans with meat  mixture. Cover with top crusts, cutting vents so steam can escape. Bake=    in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until golden-brown. Makes two  tourtieres. from the Montreal Gazette December 5 1984    Posted to MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #156    Date: Wed, 05 Jun 1996 14:17:32 -0700    From: Jo & Pete <jopete@odyssee.net>
