My mother-in-law is Icelandic and this is a recipe that was passed down  from her grandmother. Whenever she has friends visiting from Iceland she  serves then this and they comment on how much it reminds then of their  youth. Although the calls for ground prunes (I try to forget this when I  eat the cake) you can substitute your favourite jam. When you slice the  cake it is very pretty seeing all the layers.    Cream butter or margarine, add sugar gradually, add eggs one at a time. Add  milk and flavoring. Sift dry ingredients, and add to the above mixture.  Need in enough flour to make a soft "cookie" dough.    Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour    Roll thin and bake in layered cake pan for appox 10 min (350 deg f)    Tip: Roll the dough on the bottom of cake pan and put directly in the oven.    Filling: Remove stones from prunes and grind the prunes. Combine with water  and sugar. Boil mixture, being careful to stir frequently. You only boil  this mixture for 5-7 minutes. Cool the mixture.    To assemble, Spread one layer with prune filling, add second layer and  continue until all layers are used. You should have 6-7 layers.    Notes: If you want to put on an icing you can. Also, if you don;t want to  use prunes you can substitute jam.
