Seedless raisins, Boiling water, Sugar, Orange juice, Grated orange rind, Plain pastry, Salt, Lemon juice, Cornstarch, Butter, 
Preheat oven to 450F.    Line a 9-inch pie pan with plain pastry. Moisten the edges. Cut a long  strip of pastry 1 1/2-inches wide and flute on an edge.    Wash and drain raisins. Place them in a saucepan with the boiling water,  sugar and salt. Return to the boil.    Mix the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the orange juice into a paste. Stir  this into the raisin mixture and cook, stirring, over low heat until thick  and smooth. Remove from heat. Add the remaining orange juice, lemon juice,  orange rind and the butter. Stir well and pour into the unbaked pie shell.  Cover with lattice strips of pastry.    Bake in hot oven (450F) for 15 minutes then reduce the heat to 350F;  continue baking until pastry is golden brown - about 20 to 25 minutes.    Serve slightly warm.    Serves 6.
