Baked Chicken Parmesan
Butter, Chopped dried parsley, Dried Italian style bread, Dijon mustard, Dried basil, Chicken breasts, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease a 9x15 baking dish. In a  shallow bowl, combine butter with the mustard. In another shallow bowl,  blend together bread crumbs, cheese, parsley and basil. Dip chicken pieces  first into the mustard mixture, and then coat with the bread crumb mixture.  Place skin side up in the baking dish. Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes.    I always skin my chicken breasts.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Vaughndell M Dodd <dell13@JUNO.COM> on Dec 17,  1997
