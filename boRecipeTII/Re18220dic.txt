Venison Marsala
Marsala wine, Venison round, Flour, Ground white pepper, Salt, Heavy cream, Butter, Reduced meat stock, Mushrooms, 
My personal favorite and a wonderful variation on the classic Italian veal  Marsala.  This meat is cut and handled differently than the recipe above.    Method:  Cut scallopine from the round (top of hind leg) or tenderloins  about 1/2 inch thick.  Pound between two sheets wax paper to less than 1/4  inch thick.  Meanwhile, saute 1/2 pound sliced mushrooms in three  tablespoons butter until they are lightly browned and hold them aside. Mix  flour, salt and pepper and dredge meat in seasoned flour or put dry  ingredients and meats in a bag and shake to coat and saute on medium-high  heat until golden brown.  Remove meat to a heated platter.  Add mushrooms  to pan and reheat.  Add Marsala wine to pan, stirring to dislodge any  browned particles.  Add reduced meat stock and heavy cream, stirring and  bring to a full boil.  Reduce slightly until thickened enough to coat the  back of a spoon, pour over meat and serve.    NOTE:  Heavy meat stock can be made from the bones and trimmings of the  deer as you would beef or chicken stock.  Or substitute a Knorr brand  product called "Demi Glace" which can be found in supermarkets wherever the  sauce mixes live.  It comes in envelopes; just add water. Its not the real  thing but its pretty close.  If you have no other possibility, some good  quality beef gravy can be substituted and its definitely not the same as  game stock but how bad could it be?
