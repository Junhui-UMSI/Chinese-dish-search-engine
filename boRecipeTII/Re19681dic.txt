Anti-Cholesterol Drink
Grape juice, Vinegar, Apple juice, 
I have people who swear that their cholesterol has been dramatically  lowered after drinking one-quarter cup of this every morning (day) for a  few weeks (probably a longer time). Supposedly they sell this on the  streets in Florida people love it. We have made some and have decided that  even though it doesnt taste so great, well get by that and see if  anything does happen.
