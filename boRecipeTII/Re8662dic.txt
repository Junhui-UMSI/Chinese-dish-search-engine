Combine port, cabbage, onion, egg, soy sauce, salt, orange peel and hot  chili oil in large bowl and mix well. To assemble:  Dust waxed or parchment  paper with cornstarch. Set 1 rounded teaspoon filling in center of won tom  skin, pressinglightly so filling forms narrow band across middle. Moisten  rim of skin.  Bring opposite sides together to form semicircle. Pinch  together around outer edge. Transfer to cornstarch dusted paper. Cover with  dry kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining won ton and filling. Place two  heavy 12" skillets over low heat. Add 1/4 cup oil to each. Arrange  dumplings in skillets in rows, fitting closely together. Increase heat to  medium-high and cook uncovered until bottoms are deeply golden, about 2  minutes, checking occasionally. Add 1/2 cup water to each pan and cover  immediately.  Let steam until skins are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Remove cover and continue cooking over medium to medium-high heat until  bottoms are very crisp and well browned.  Drain off excess oil if  necessary.  Loosen dumplings with spatula and transfer to serving dish.  Serve immediately.
