NOTE:  Oz in the above measurements referes to ounces of weight, not  volume.     Grind meat through a 1/4" or 3/8" grinder plate. Add all the  ingredients, except the water and mix thoroughly until evenly distributed.  Then place the meat in the food processor, adding the water as you go  along.  This will help emulsify the meat.     Stuff into a 32-35mm hog casing and make 5" to 6" links. Place into 160  degree F. water and cook until an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. is  attained. Then shower the sausage with cool water until the internal  temperature falls to 75 degrees F.  Place in cooler overnight before using.
