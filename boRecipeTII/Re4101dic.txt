Pepperoni Rolls
Bread flour, Sugar, Dry yeast, pepperoni, Salt, Water, olive oil, 
From: Carolyn Giberson <giber@pollux.cs.uga.edu>    Date: 26 Mar 1994 15:18:17 -0500  I make a recipe of a generic white bread using my Cuisinart as follows: Mix  the yeast and sugar in a cup measure.  Add about 1/2 v. warm water and stir  to mix. Let this sit until bubbly.    In the food processor bowl, place the flour, salt, and oil.  Mix.  With the  motor running, pour in the yeast mixture, followed by enough cold water to  make a dough that cleans the sides of the bowl.  Whirl the dough ball about  30 times around the bowl, then let sit for 5 minutes.    Whirl the dough about 30 more times, adding a little more flour if the  dough seems sticky. Take the dough out of the processor and knead until a  smooth dough is obtained. Place in an oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap  and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (about 1 hour).    Knead again lightly and divide into 9 equal portions.  Flatten each portion  and wrap it around 2 of the pepperoni sticks.  Place on a greased cookie  sheet (seam side down), lightly oil the tops, cover with plastic wrap, and  let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (should take 45 minutes -        1    hour).    Bake at 375 F for about 20 minutes, or until nicely browned.  These are  best warm, right out of the oven, but they do freeze and re-heat well too.
