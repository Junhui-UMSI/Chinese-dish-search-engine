1. Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Whisk  yolk with milk and butter.    2. Beat egg white until it just holds a 2-inch peak.    3. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a thin steady stream while  gently mixing with a rubber spatula-, be careful not to add liquid faster  than you can incorporate it. Toward end of mixing, use a folding motion to  incorporate ingredients-, gently fold egg whites into batter.    4. Spread appropriate amount of batter onto waffle iron. Following  manufacturers instructions, cook waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5  minutes. Serve immediately. (You can can keep waffles warm on a wire rack  in a 200-degree oven for up to 5 minutes.)    Serves 3 to 4.    Cooks Illustrated, Nov./Dec. 1993, Page 28. Credit: Christopher Kimball.
