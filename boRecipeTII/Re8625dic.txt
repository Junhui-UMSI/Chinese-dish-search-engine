Here are some Polish recipes Ive gotten from my mother-in-law. They are  "word-of mouth" recipes, passed down from Grandma to Mom to me. Hope these  help.    Mix all ingredients, then fold into beaten egg whites. If too thick to  spread, add a little cream or half and half for easy spreading.    Potica: Dissolve yeast in lukewarm milk with 1 teaspoon sugar. Cut butter  and margarine into flour with 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. When  mixture is as fine as cornmeal, add dissolved yeast and beaten egg yolks.  Mix well. Shape into a ball, pat lightly with flour and wrap in waxed  paper. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight. Next day, divide roll in half.  Roll each piece into rectangle 1/4 inch thick. Spread out filling and roll  up like jellyroll. Place in greased 10 inch tube pans. Cover and let rise  until doubled, 1 1/2 hours. Brush tops with coffee and bake at 400 degrees  for 45 minutes or til nicely browned.    Note: This is a must for all Polish households on holidays.
