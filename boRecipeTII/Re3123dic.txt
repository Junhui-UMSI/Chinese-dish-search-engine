From Favorite Recipes of University Women - Desserts    Filling: Blend peanut butter with confectioners sugar until mealy.  Sprinkle 2/3 of the mixture over baked pie crust. Combine flour, sugar and  salt in the top of double boiler. Stir in milk. Cook over boiling water,  stirring constantly until thickened. Stir small amount of cooked filling  into egg yolks. Combine with remaining hot mixture; cook for several  minutes more. Add butter and vanilla. Pour into pie shell. Top with  meringue.    Meringue: Beat egg whites until stiff; add cream of tartar. Mix sugar with  cornstarch. Add gradually; beat stiff. Pile on pie; sprinkle with remaining  peanut butter mixture. Bake in 400F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until  delicately-browned. Cool before serving. Yield: 6-8 servings.    NOTES : I make the filling in the microwave oven instead of the double  boiler, stirring the mixture several times during cooking. This is a  delicious, light peanut butter pie, and the peanut butter/confec. sugar  topping on the meringue is lightly crunchy, giving a nice contrast to the  rest.  Recipe by: Mrs. James A.
