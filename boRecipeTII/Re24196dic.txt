(finish), Munich malt, Dark brown sugar (in boil), Domestic 2-row pale malted, Yeast cultured from a bottle, Chimay Rou, Chocolate malt, Chinook (10.8% AA) (boil), (priming), Hallertauer (2.8%) (finish), Light dry malt extract, Barley, Kent Goldings (5.2%), Wheat malt, Tettnanger (4.7%) (finish), 
Heat  14  quarts of mash water to 135 degrees. Mash-in  for  3  minutes.  Adjust pH to about 5.3. Protein rest for 30 minutes for 131-128 degrees.  Conversion  of about 2 hours at 150-141 degrees. Mash-out for 5  minutes at  168  degrees. Sparge with 5.5 gallons at 168-165  degrees.   Boil  2 hours.  Add  boiling  hops at 60 mins and finish hops at  end  of  boil. Chill.  Pitch yeast. The only substantial change Id make to the hopping is to  dry-hop rather than finish-hop, using the same quantities of the same varie  ties. After three weeks of fascinating fermentation, a strong beer was pro-  duced that was intriguingly complex and true to type. After a few months in  the bottle it acquired a strong banana-ester component in  the  nose that  priming  with corn sugar rather than DME might  have  ameliorated. Good  stuff, IMHO.
