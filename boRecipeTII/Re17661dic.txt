Cut shortening into flour; add salt and water to consistency of soft dough.  Roll dough very thin; cut into strips about 4 inches by 3 inches. Place on  each strip 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling. Roll lengthwise to make finger  strips. Use fork to seal finger strips. Fry in vegetable oil and drain on  absorbent paper. Dip in cool syrup while hot. Do not cover, so they will  stay crisp.    Thaktila can be frozen uncooked or cooked, as needed. Leftover syrup does  not spoil and may be kept in refrigerator in airtight jar. Makes 100-120  pieces.
