The Best Chicken-Fried Steak South of Omaha
Salt and pepper, Eggs, Flat beer, Flour, round steak cutlet, 
Bill Maxwell, former Texas restaurateur, originally claimed his  chicken-fried steak was the "best found south of the Rio Brazos."  Subsequent chicken-fried steak contests proved him truthful, so he extended  his claim to include all lands south of the Arkansas River. In another  conversation with Bill, we found his "boundary" had crept north to Omaha,  Nebraska. Well, eventually hes gonna have to stop at the North Pole ... we  hope.    Sprinkle salt, pepper and garlic salt on both sides of tenderized steak to  taste. Put steak onto a tray that is well-covered with flour. Then "pound  the hell out of it (the steak) with stiff fingers, working from the center  out, until it reaches the size of an L.P. record." (Thats those things  they used to make before compact discs). Flip several times and repeat  pounding. Mix eggs, beer, 1 teaspoon salt and Adolphs meat tenderizer in a  shallow bowl. Add enough flour to make a thin, watery batter. Beat mixture  smooth. Dip meat into batter. "Flop" back onto flour tray and cover with  four. Pound again with fingertips until moisture is absorbed. Cook in deep  fat at 350 degrees until golden brown. Serve with French fries and cover  with white gravy.
