White and Green Bean Soup
Water, Black Pepper, Cloves garlic, chopped, Fresh green beans (about 3/4, Diagonal in 1-inch pieces, Dried white beans, Great, Juice of 1/2 lemon, Salt, Beef broth, Rosemary, crumbled, Butter, 
Wash and pick over the dried beans.  Put them into a large saucepan or  kettle with the water and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and  allow to stand for 1 hour.    Return to the heat and bring to a boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer,  partially covered, for 1/2 hour. Using a heavy fork, mash the garlic with  the salt until no large chunks remain. Add to the saucepan with the beans.  Add the broth, pepper, and rosemary.    Simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender. This can take 15 minutes  or as long as 1 hour; timing for beans is hard to predict - keep checking.    Soup can be made ahead to this point, and refrigerated or frozen after  thorough cooling.    Cook the green beans uncovered in 2 uarts of boiling salted water until  they are tender-crisp and bright green. Drain and add to the soup when the  white beans are tender but not mushy. If green beans are not to be added  right away, rinse in cold water to retain color. Stir in the butter and  lemon.  Serve at once, while green beans are still bright.    Note:  If you want some of the soup pureed, do it before adding the green  beans - the color will be better.    Serves 6 to 8.    From:  MAIN COURSE SOUPS & STEWS by Dorothy Ivens ISBN0-06-015131-5.
