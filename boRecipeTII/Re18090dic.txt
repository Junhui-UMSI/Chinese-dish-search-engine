Veggie Salad
Carrots, Sweet peas, Garbonzo beans (sp?), Cut green beans, Asparagas, Sweet corn, 
Chill the cans over night or put in frig before leaving for work/school the  morning. When ready to serve, open cans, drain all juices. You may wish to  reserve the juices and drink them (my dad always did). Dump all the drained  veggies into a large bowl and mix/toss. Serve up with your favorite salad  dressing. We have this as our entire meal now days, but when I was growing  up, mom served it as a side dish to go with a meat patty.    This is very versital and you may use any canned veggies you wish. You are  only limited by the size of your frig and your choice of veggies. Im not a  beet freak so I dont have them now, but when I was growing up.... You get  the picture... <smile>    Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Oct 96    From:    "Lorijo A. Ernst" <ernstl@HQ.RS.AF.MIL>    Date:    Fri, 11 Oct 1996 08:57:52 CST
