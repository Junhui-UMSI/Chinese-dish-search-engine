Hi all. This is a salsa I created for a potluck this week. I intended it  for dipping tortilla chips, etc... But I guess you can also use it as  glazing for broiling, roasting or grilling chicken, ham or pork, (but  youll have to thin it out a bit). I bet a spoonful of this stuff could  also jazz up your potato soup, corn chowder, bean & ham soup, etc...    Chop carrots. Combine in a blender or food processor with guava nectar,  garlic, habaneros, tomato, lime juice, cumin powder, balsamic vinegar,  dried fruit and 1 tbsp of cilantro. Blend for 2 minutes or until mixture  has the consistency of a paste. Add chopped onions and rest of cilantro.  Let sit in refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Eat as dipping salsa with  tortilla chips or pita bread (surprisingly, low-fat saltines, wheat thins  and triscuits also work with this salsa).
