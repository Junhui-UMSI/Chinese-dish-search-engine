Valentine Lollipops
Imported white chocolate, Plastic 6-count lollipop mold, Lollipop sticks, Gold ribbons, Red cellophane bags, Imported bittersweet chocola, 
Lightly oil lollipop molds. In small bowl set over saucepan of simmering  water, stir white chocolate just until melted and smooth. Remove bowl from  over water. In another small bowl set over same saucepan of simmering  water, stir bittersweet chocolate just until melted and smooth. Cool  chocolates slightly. Drizzle small spoonful of white chocolate into bottom  of each mold. Drizzle small spoonful of bittersweet chocolate over. Using  toothpick, swirl chocolates slightly to marbleize. Repeat layering of  chocolates and swirling until molds are filled. Insert lollipop sticks into  groove in molds and rotate sticks to coat with chocolate. Gently tap molds  on work surface to release air bubbles. Refrigerate lollipops until very  firm, at least 3 hours or overnight. Refrigerate cookie sheets until  chilled. Invert molds onto chilled cookie sheets. Gently bend corners to  release lollipops (it may be necessary to let molds stand 30 seconds and  then repeat bending). If desired, insert each lollipop into cellophane bag  and tie decoratively with ribbon. (Lollipops can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Cover tightly and keep refrigerated.)
