Tasty Chicken Vachos
Potatoes, thinly sliced (1, Diced onions, Cooked chicken, shredded or, Sliced ripe olives, Picante sauce, Grated lowfat cheddar cheese, Grated Monterey Jack cheese, Sliced jalapeno peppers, 
A low-fat alternative to nachos.    Here are two recipes I picked up in the Health Zone at AOL. The chocolate  shakes are great, but I havent tried the nacho/vachos yet.    Boil potato slices for 3-5 minutes or until slightly tender. Drain and  arrange on an oven-safe serving platter, overlapping slices. Combine  chicken, picante sauce and onions in a small bowl; spoon this mixture over  potatoes. Sprinkle with cheese, olives and jalapenos. Broil 4-6" from heat  until cheese is melted.
