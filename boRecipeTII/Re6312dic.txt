However as always you can reduce the heat  in cooking it (diners can always add more chili later, but they cant take  it out!) bai kaprao (holy basil) is a Thai variety. If not available  substitute ordinary european basil. Thai eggplants (makheua pro) are a  yellowish green fruit the size of a golfball. If you cant get them, then  you could substitute common purple aubergine.    Heat a little oil in a wok and stir fry the garlic, then add the curry  paste, and stir until aromatic.  Add the squid, and stir fry briefly.  This  cooks very quickly and becomes rubbery if overcooked. You may prefer to  lift the wok from the stove to stir in the squid. Add the remaining  ingredients, and stir until the flavors are combined. As soon as the squid  is cooked transfer to a serving dish.    Note: because the squid cooks so quickly, you might prefer to steam the  squid, and to combine and reduce the other ingredients to form a dipping  sauce.    In either case serve with prik dong (pickled red chilis), nam pla prik  (green chilis in fish sauce), prik phom (chili powder), sugar, and fresh  ground ginger.    If you are serving it "dip style", then you could also add a mild satay  sauce as a contrasting dip. Those who prefer a hotter dip might also use  nam prik narok (literally "the dipping sauce from Hell")    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #314    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
