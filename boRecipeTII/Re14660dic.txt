"Smoking" Punch
Jar white grape juice, Bottle Canada Dry Gingerale, Bottle Sprite/7up/no name, Lemonade concentrate, OJuice concentrate, Water, 
To make it "smoke" put dry ice in instead of regular ice.    This punch is not alcoholic, but it tastes as if their might be something  in it. Since my family knows whats in it, we dont care, but I have had  the question put to me - "Whats in the punch?" "I could have sworn that  there was a little something else..."
