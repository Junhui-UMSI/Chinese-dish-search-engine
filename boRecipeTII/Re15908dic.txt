Halve squash lengthwise.  Seed, then steam for 20 minutes (squash will not  be fully cooked).  Set aside.  (May be prepared one day ahead.  Refrigerate.)    Bring water and tamari to a boil in a 2-quart saucepan over medium-high  heat.  Add rice and return to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, covered,  until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender. (Rice may be cooked up to 2  days ahead; refrigerate until used.)    For Stuffing: In a large skillet, saute carrots, celery, onion, thyme and  ginger in margarine or butter until onions are golden. Thoroughly toss in  pecans, orange zest and rice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove  from heat and set aside.  (Stuffing may be prepared 1 day ahead and  refrigerated.)    Put glaze ingredients into a small jar and shake vigorously to combine.  Keep refrigerated until ready to use.  (Glaze may be prepared a day ahead.)    One hour before serving, preheat oven to 375 F.  Mound stuffing mixture  into each squash half to about 2 inches over top of squash. Place stuffed  squash halves in a baking pan filled with 1/2 cup of water. Drizzle some  glaze over stuffing and brush onto squash. Cover with foil and bake 20  minutes.    Drizzle remaining glaze over squash, and continue baking, uncovered, for  another 20 minutes until glazed and lightly browned. Serve immediately.
