Texas Tommy
Hot dog, Bacon, Garnishes, Roll, Square white American cheese, 
(From the Cup, Pottstown, Pa.)    Split the hot dog down the center, and lay cheese inside. Wrap the  hot dog and cheese in bacon and secure with a toothpick. Drop the  whole thing into a deep fryer. It will sink in the grease, and when  it floats its done. Serve with roll and favorite garnishes.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
