Trimming and Precooking Artichokes
Water, Artichoke, Juice of 3 lemons, 
Trim stem of artichoke to about 1/4 inch, so artichoke can stand. Remove  tough outer leaves. With a scissors, trim the top of each leaf by  approximately 1/4-1/2 inch to remove thistle. In pot bring water and lemon  juice to a simmer. Add artichoke. Place a towel over artichokes to keep  them submerged. Simmer for 12-15 minutes; until inner choke can be removed,  but before outer leaves begin to fall off. Drain artichokes upside down on  towels. When cool, carefully remove inner leaves and hairy choke with a  spoon.
