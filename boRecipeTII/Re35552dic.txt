Streamside Trout
Cooking oil, -Trout fillets, Salt and pepper, Whole dressed trout; -OR-, Cornmeal, 
I call this one Streamside trout because it is so basic that you  can do it along your favorite trout stream on your camp stove. It  basic, also, because you dont have to do too much to trout or any  fish when they are that fresh.    Put salt, pepper and cornmeal in paper bag. Drop trout in bag and  shake vigorously to coat with mixture. Place in hot frying pan and  cook until golden brown.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mm-trout.zip
