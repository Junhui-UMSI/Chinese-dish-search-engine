Add eggs one at a time beating well  after each.  Add flour and milk alternately beginning and ending with  flour.  Fold in flavoring by hand. Bake in greased tube pan. Put cake in  COLD oven then turn oven on to 325 degrees. Bake 1 hour 45 minutes. Do not  open door while baking. Remove cake from pan immediately after removing it  from oven. The best thing about this cake is that the outside is crunchy,  and the inside is wonderfully moist! Debbie Nachman NOTE! The recipe called  for "2 margarine", I am not sure 2 Tbsp is enough, but 2 cups sure seems  way too much! --Glen    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.
