Sweet and Sour Wing Chicken Wing Sauce
Vinegar (cider or white), Ketchup, Water, (heaping) cornstarch, Sugar, Water, 
This is for Karen who is looking for recpies for the wings of 50 pounds of  25 pounds of very unhappy chickens she has. This is a sauce and should be  served warm. I Have no idea where I got this recipe, but I have been using  it for years because it is so delicious.    Combine ketchup, sugar, water, and vinegar in a saucepan and bring it to a  boil. Add dissolved cornstarch and stir constantly (use a whisk to break up  the clumps) until thickened.    Posted to Kitmailbox Digest  by "Steve Royal" <sroyal@rpa.net> on Feb 27,  1997.
