Peanut Butter #1
Peanuts, Salt (if desired), Olive oil (if desired), 
Shell the peanuts; roast just enough so that the hulls may be slipped off  easily ; remove all the hulls by gently rolling, fanning, and screening.  Grind peanuts very fine in any sort of mill, passing through several times  if necessary. Pack into cans, bottles or jars, and seal if not for  immediate use. Some manufacturers add a little salt and a small amount of  olive oil; others do not, according to taste. For small quantities of  butter, a good meat grinder will answer the purpose. If the nuts are ground  fine enough, no additional oil will be necessary for easy spreading.
