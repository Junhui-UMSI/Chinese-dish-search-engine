Sweet Potato Biscuits (Nelson)
Unbleached white flour, Baking Powder, Salt, Well mashed; cooked sweet, Whole wheat pastry flour, Margarine, Honey, Finely chopped walnuts OR, Apple juice, 
Preheat over to 425F degrees.    In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt. Work  the margarine in with a pastry blender or the tines of a fork until the  mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the apple juice, sweet potato, honey,  and nuts, and work them in to form a soft dough.    Turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead in just enough flour  to maek the dough lose its stickiness.    With floured hands, divide the dough into 16 equal parts. Shape into small  balls and arrange on a lightly oiled cookie sheet, patting them down a bit  to flatten. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until a tooth pick inserted into  the center of one tests clean. Transfer the biscuits to a plate and serve  hot.
