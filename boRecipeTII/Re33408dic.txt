Add all other ingredients and mix well.  1 teaspoon of  filling is used for each wonton.                    *                       *                       *    With one corner of the skin toward you, place 1  teaspoon of filling about an inch from the corner.    Fold one corner to cover the filling.    Told once more...about 3/4 inch.    Turn the won ton so that the triangel is toward you.  Dampen the left corner with a little water.    Swing the right corner away from you and place it on  top of the dampened left corner.  As you make this  fold, simultaneously pull the filling toward you with  your middle finger. You should finish with a little  "hat-like" effect.    SOURCE: Chopstick, Cleaver and Wok.
