Zeughauskeller Potato Salad
Mealy potatoes, Salad dressing, Fresh parsley, Chicken Stock, Beef stock, Small onion, 
(The Zeughauskeller is a big, cheerful restaurant in Zuerich which  specializes in sausages, as well as serving steak, chicken, fish, and very  good beer and Swiss wine, in an atmosphere of relaxed history [the  restaurant building used to be the town armory, and working weapons still  hang on the walls].  The following recipe is for their potato salad. They  go through twenty metric tons of it per year.)    (This recipe is an early approximation of the original recipe. All amounts  have been converted from the original metric, and reduced.) . Salad  dressing:  About 1/2 C of a good mayonnaise, the fresher the better -- I  think the Zeughauskeller makes their own fresh, every day -- mixed to taste  with German-style mustard (i.e. a sharp yellow mustard rather than a brown  one).    Every utensil must be scrupulously clean, then scalded, including pans. ~-  Peel and cut up potatoes. Cook until "almost ready", then drain (trying to  retain starch).  Put in pan.  -- Pour BOILING stock over potatoes to bring  out the starch and bind the potatoes together. Let sit 45 minutes to  absorb.  -- Chop parsley and onions (to taste) by hand. Add to potatoes,  toss;  let sit in hot mixture to add flavor. ~- Pour salad dressing over  salad:  toss.
