Recipe By: Diana Rattray    Saute the onions, bell peppers, and anaheims in the oil for a few minutes  then add the chicken broth and saute until the broth is about gone.  Add  the habaneros (I roasted mine first), the diced tomatoes (okay, I added the  extra two cans to cut the heat down a bit, so if you want it super hot you  can eliminate the cans or a couple of the habaneros), lime and lemon  juices, coriander, oregano, sugar, salt and pepper. Simmer for 20 or 30  minutes and add the parsley and simmer a few more minutes.    Serving Ideas : Use as a dip or topping for grilled chicken, seafood, etc.    NOTES : diana@ebicom.net    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
