Mix in the wet ones and knead the dough for  10-12 minutes. Cover the dough at this point in a bowl and allow to sit for  2 hours. Take it out and knead again for 3-4 minutes. Shape into a round  ball and and cover it for 30 minutes more. Take the ball between your hands  and roll it into a long thin shape akin to the of a French bread loaf,  approximately 2-3 inches in diameter. Be sure to keep your hands wet when  handling the dough at all stages thus far.    Grease a cookie sheet and place the dough upon it. Proof the dough in a  warm oven (about 85 degree F.) for 45 minutes. Bake in a 375 degree F moist  oven (place 1 cup of water in a metal bowl in the oven) for 20 minutes.  Remove the water bowl and continue to bake for 30 minutes more at 375  degrees F. This makes one long loaf or it may be made into 2 shorter loaves  or even into rolls.
