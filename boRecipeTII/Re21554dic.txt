Apple Pork Steak
Rum extract, Pork steaks, cut 3/4 inch, Apple juice, Prepared mustard, Vinegar, Soy sauce, 
Remove excess fat from steaks.    Measure remaining six ingredients into deep bowl. Add chops. Marinate at  least two hours or overnight in refrigerator. Place chops on greased grill  over medium heat. Baste with sauce. Continue to baste and turn until done,  about 15 minutes total time.    NOTES : I use pork chops and less rum extract (1 teaspoon).  It is best if  you marinate overnight.    Recipe by: Companys Coming Barbecues Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #612 by  Kim Robb <krobb@summer.com> on May 14, 1997
