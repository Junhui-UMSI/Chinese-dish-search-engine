Zucchini Saute
Red onion, tomato, fresh basil, Chopped, Yellow summer squash, Zucchini, 
"Saute" red onion in a pan that has been lightly sprayed with Pam and wiped  and to which a tablespoon or two of water has been added, until soft. Add  squash and saute for about five minutes, turning every so often. Add tomato  and basil -- cover and cook for another five minutes, or so, until  everything has blended nicely together.    Ive been making this dish for years . . . its easy and yummy . . . good  hot or cold. I try to make it with both yellow squash and zucchini -- but I  generally use whatever I have on hand. This makes generous servings for two  ~- served over rice as a main meal. Or, I use it as an side dish for dinner  and for lunch the next day.    From: Jane Segelken <jsegelke@cce.cornell.edu>.
