Athenian Cheese Pie
Parmesan cheese, Filo pastry, Eggs, Greek Feta cheese; crumbled, Butter, Salt to taste, Cottage cheese, Black Pepper, 
Beat eggs until light and creamy. Fold in crumbled Feta, cottage and  Parmesan cheeses.  Season with salt and pepper. Place half of pastry sheets  in buttered 11x17 pan, brushing each pastry sheet individually with butter.  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WITH MARGARINE. Pour in cheese filling. Cover with  remaining half of pastry sheets, brushing each with butter. Brush entire  pie generously with butter. Bake, uncovered, at 350? for 45 minutes, or  until golden. Cut into squares, while still hot, and serve warm. This may  be prepared and frozen.     Working with filo pastry is a little difficult, but this dish is very  different and delicious so its well worth the trouble.    HELEN N. DAMASKOS (MRS.
