1. Add all ingredients for the dough in the order suggested by your bread  machine manual and process on the dough cycle according to the  manufacturers directions.    2. While the dough is being processed, prepare the topping. Coat two  10-inch cake pans with cooking spray. In a small saucepan, boil the apple  juice concentrate over high heat until reduced by half, about 5 minutes.  Pour the syrup into the two pans, dividing evenly and swirling if necessary  to coat the bottoms. Quarter, core, and peel the apples. Cut each quarter  into eighths. Arrange apples in concentric circles in each pan, overlapping  the apples.    3. When the dough cycle ends, remove the dough from the machine. Preheat  the oven to 350 degrees. Divide the dough in half. On a floured surface  with a floured rolling pin, roll each piece into a 10-inch circle. Place  each circle on top of a pan of apples.    4. Bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until the tops are brown and bubbling around  the edges. Remove from the oven. Let rest 5 minutes, then invert onto a  plate larger than the pan so that you will not lose any syrup that drips  down the sides. Eat warm, not hot.
