Slice leeks and tomatoes.  Layer in casserole dish (leeks on the bottom so  the juice from the tomatoes helps cook them  :).  Sprinkle with red wine vinegar. Add cheese. Add layer of bread crumbs.  Spice according to taste. (Repeat layer if desired). Cook at 375 until  bread crumbs are golden.    The amounts of ingredients in this one can be varied. Some ppl prefer more  tomatoes, while I am allergic to them so tend to skimp there  :)  The lack of cooking time is due to the origination of the recipe. I  learned it in Holland and the oven temps there are far different from here.  We usually made it in some old nearly broken down toaster oven so the time  varied with each attempt  :)  I have found many non vegan friends love this recipe.
