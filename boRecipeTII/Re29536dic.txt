Tart Dough and Prebaking
Salt, Chilled shortening cut into, Flour, Cold butter cut into, Cold water, Egg,; lightly beaten, Grated Gruyere or Swiss, 
In a food processor combine the flour with the salt. Process the butter and  shortening until they are cut into tiny pieces. Add 8 tablespoons of the  water and process until it comes into a ball. If it is dry, add water by  tablespoonfuls.    Turn the dough onto a board and press it into a round slab about 1-inch  thick. If it is not too hot, roll the dough out immediately. (easier to  handle) But if the fat is oozing out, then refrigerate for 2 hours at least  or overnight to relax the dough.    Gently flour your board and rolling pin. Roll dough out from the center  until it forms a circle about 1/2-inch thick; turn over and roll until a  little thicker than 1/8th-inch thick and 14-inches in diameter.    Roll the dough over a lightly buttered 12inch false bottomed tart shell.  Press the dough into the pan and trim the edges pressing up a border  1/2-inch wide. Fold that border back into the pan (it should not overlap  the bottom) and press it back into the sides of the tart shell so that you  are building up a double thickness of shell wall. Roll the rolling pin over  the top to trim off excess pastry and refrigerate for 30 minutes.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Set the pan on a baking sheet. Line the dough  with foil or parchment and fill it with dried beans. Bake for 10 minutes.  Remove beans and bake 10 minutes longer. Paint the bottom of the shell with  egg and sprinkle on grated cheese and return to oven for 3 to 4 minutes to  really seal the bottom. Remove from oven and cool tart shell on a rack for  30 minutes before filling and finishing baking.    Yield: enough for two 8inch tart shells or one 12inch tart  Recipe By     :COOKING MONDAY TO FRIDAY SHOW # MF6712    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #285    Date: Thu, 7 Nov 1996 23:38:29 -0500    From: Meg Antczak <meginny@frontiernet.net>
