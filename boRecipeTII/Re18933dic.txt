Kennedy recipes in Food & Wine ANGEL HAIR PASTA WITH ANCHO  CHILE SAUCE (Sopa Seca de Fideo con Chile Ancho) From "Libro di Cocina" by  Jules Gouffe, pub. in Mexico in 1893 1.In a nonreactive medium saucepan,  cover the chiles with water and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and  let soak until soft, 5 more minutes. Drain. 2.Pour 1/4 cup of the chicken  stock into the blender, add the cloves, garlic and cumin seeds and blend  until smooth.  Season with salt.  Add 1 more cup of the stock and the  drained chiles, a few at a time, and blend until smooth, adding more stock  if necessary. 3.Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan. Add the pasta and  fry, turning, until it has turned a deep golden color, about 3 minutes  (keep the nests intact). Strain off excess oil. 4.Add the blended sauce to  the pasta in the skillet and fry over moderate heat for about 3 minutes,  scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. Cover and cook over low  heat, adding the remaining stock a little at a time to prevent sticking,  until the pasta is just cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. 5.Transfer to a  serving  dish, sprinkle with the cheese and serve with the avocado and  limes. 4 first course servings.
