Tuna and Mushroom Cream over Pasta
pasta, White tuna, Black Pepper, Fresh chives, Garlic, Evaporated nonfat milk, Corn oil, Shallots, Button mushrooms, Fresh Italian parsley, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the oil with the shallots and garlic  over moderate heat. When the vegetables sizzle, raise the heat to high and  add the mushrooms, sauteing just until they begin to brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Reduce the heat and add the evaporated milk. Simmer briskly, stirring  frequently to guard against boiling over, until the milk reduces by about a  third, to a creamy consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the parmesan cheese  and, as soon as it melts, fold in the tuna and herbs. Simmer just until the  tuna is heated through, then spoon over cooked pasta. Season with black  pepper to taste.
