Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Cook and  stir onion in the oil in a 10-inch skillet until tender. Stir in the  remaining ingredients except the fish. Simmer, uncovered, until thickened,  about 15 minutes. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Drain the fish fillets  and pat dry. Place 1 piece of fish on each of eight 12-inch squares of  heavy duty aluminum foil. Spoon some tomato mixture onto the fish. Fold  foil over the fish and seal securely. Place the foil packets in an  ungreased jelly roll pan, 15 1/2 X 10 1/2 X 1-inch. Bake until fish flakes  easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Serve with snipped fresh cilantro and  lemon wedges if desired.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MealMaster recipe list.
