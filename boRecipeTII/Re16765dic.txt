I did, and this is it! It makes declicious  kreplach!    DOUGH: Mix all ingredients in mixer with dough hooks until dough forms  ball. Put dough on floured board & knead for a bit. Divide the dough into 2  and roll thin. Cut into strips & then squares. Fill. Fold into triangles.  Pinch sides together.    FILLING: Cook meat in oil with onion & carrot before you grind.  After  cool, add egg. Then mix everything together.    After Kreplach are filled, blast freeze.  Throw into plastic bag after  frozen.    When ready to serve, boil in salted water (1 tbsp. regular salt).  Boil  20-25 mins., then throw into hot soup. If dough feels sticky, add a little  flour.
