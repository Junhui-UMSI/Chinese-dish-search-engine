Tilapia with Lemon
Lemon, Italian-style breadcrumbs, Butter spray, Tilapia , 
Line small baking dish with foil, and spritz with nonstick spray. Rinse  filets, and lay in dish.  Spray lightly with butter spray, and squeeze half  the lemon over both.  Coat evenly with crumbs, and squeeze a few more drops  of lemon over each.  Bake for 20 minutes at 350, uncovered. Squeeze other  half of lemon over fish before serving.    We made "Roasted veggies" to go with this.    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n209    Date: Tue, 5 Nov 1996 7:41:01 -0500 (EST)    From: NFRITZ@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov
