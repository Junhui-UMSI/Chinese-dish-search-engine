TO MAKE THE MOUSSE, place white chocolate pieces in a large bowl with  butter and rum. Place the bowl in a very low oven with the door ajar. The  chocolate should take about 45 minutes to melt. This must be done slowly.  Meanwhile, beat egg yolks in a large bowl of an electric mixer until light  and thick. Transfer to top of double boiler. Cook, stirring, over hot water  until thick. Return to mixer bowl. When chocolate is melted, stir with a  wooden spoon until smooth. Slowly beat in egg yolks. Beat cream until  stiff. Fold into chocolate mixture. Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold into  mixture. Pour into a lightly oiled 8-inch spring form pan. Refrigerate  overnight.    To serve, cut into pieces and place on cold plates. Drizzle a small amount  of warm chocolate sauce over the top of each wedge and place a "puddle" on  either side.    CHOCOLATE SAUCE:  Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler. Stir in  unsalted butter, stir in milk and heavy cream, both at room temperature.  Keep warm.    Source:  Unknown. Shared on alt. creative-cook and alt. creative-cooking by  Judi M. Phelps.
