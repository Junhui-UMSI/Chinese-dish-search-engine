Strawberry Daiquiri Ice
Light rum, Sugar, Sliced, Fresh strawberries --, Lime juice, 
1. If using fresh strawberries, spread in one layer on a baking sheet and  freeze, uncovered, until frozen solid.    2. Place frozen berries and remaining ingredients in a food processor or  blender. Process until smooth. If your machine struggles to process the  fruit, let fruit stand 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature to thaw  slightly.    3. Serve immediately or store in freezer until 5 to 15 minutes before  serving, then place in refrigerator or on counter to soften enough that it  can be scooped.    * Timesaver Tip: Recipe can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and stored in  freezer. The rum lowers the freezing point of the ice, which helps it  maintain a smooth texture.
