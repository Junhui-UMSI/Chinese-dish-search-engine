Banana Malt
Vanilla (optional), Bananas, Rice Milk (maybe more?), To 2 frozen very ripe, To 2 Tbs Malt powder, 
Break or slice the banana into small chunks and put in a blender.  Add malt  powder.  Add a small amount of the rice milk and start to blend. Add more  rice milk as necessary until the banana goes from chunks to puree, then  blend for another minute or two before adding the rest of the rice milk and  optional vanilla.    If you try to blend all the ingredients at once youre likely to end up  with un-blended banana chunks.    This recipe is a good way to use over-ripe bananas, which we peel and  freeze when theyve been on the counter for a bit too long.    From: Raymond.Jackson@ebay.sun.com (Raymond Jackson).
