Vegetable Tomato Juice
Carrot, tomatoes, Lemon juice, green pepper, Onion, Parsley, Celery, 
Remove core and blossom end from 5 pounds of FULLY ripe tomatoes. Cut into  quarters. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer 20 minuets or until all are  soft, stirring often to prevent sticking. Press through a fine sieve or  food mill. Measure juice and add 1 Tbsp. Lemon Juice or 1/4 teas. Citric  Acid for each pint. Keeps about a week or process as above. This will make  between 1 and 2 quarts. NOTE this is the smallest batch I have been able to  make and keep the flavor true. I also like it with a drop or two of  Worcestershire sauce added with the lemon juice.  Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Judy E Ryder <jeryder@JUNO.COM> on Jan 22, 1998
