Turkish Mina De Espinaca Con Carne
Pignolia, optional, Onion, Fresh spinach, Matzos, Ground beef, Mashed potatoes, Vegetable oil, Salt, or to taste, Eggs, Allspice, 
Soak the unbroken matzos in cold water until soft. Drain very well on a  cloth or paper towel. Squeeze if necessary. (This step is important, or the  mina will be too soggy and not crunchy.) Wash the s pinach well, drain  thoroughly, and dry, then chop lightly. Saute the onion in 2 tbsp oil. Add  the meat and cook until browned. Just before it is done, add the pignolias,  if using. Season with salt an d allspice. Degrease. Cook the spinach  briefly, just until it wilts. Drain and mix with meat and potatoes. Beat  two eggs well and add to the spinach-meat mixture. Preheat oven to 400F.  Grease a pie p late or square baking pan with 2 tbsp oil. Cover the bottom  of the pan with 2 whole matzos. If they break up, you can patch them.  Spread the spinach-meat mixture on top. Cover with the remaining 2 ma tzos.  Brush the top with the remaining 2 tbsp oil. Beat the remaining egg and  spread over all. Bake 50 min or until top is lightly browned.    NOTES : From _The Jewish Holiday Kitchen_ by Joan Nathan. Schocken Books,  New York: 1988.
