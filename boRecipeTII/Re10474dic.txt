In a saucepan combine the fish stock with the tomato juice, gelatin, salt,  pepper, sugar, egg shells and egg whites and heat slowly, stirring  constantly, until the mixture boils up in the pan.   Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cognac.   Strain the mixture through a sieve lined with a flannel cloth that has  been rinsed in cold water and wrung out.
