Yeast Cakes (Easy To Make and Good)
Cornmeal, Warm water, Yeast cake; home-made, Flour, 
Soften 1 home-made yeast cake in 1 cup luke-warm water.  Add about 1 cup  flour, or enough to make a sponge dough.  Set in a warm place to rise until  double in bulk; then stir in enough cornmeal to stiffen.  Cover board with  a thin layer of cornmeal.  Onto this dump the mixture.  Form into a long  roll about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and cut into cakes about 1/2 inch  thick.  Dry in shade; then store in a flour sack, hung in a cool dry place.  The keep for a month or longer. -- HOW TO USE COMPRESSED YEAST:    In using compressed yeast you may use double or even tripple the quantity  of yeast given in your recipe in order to shorten time of fermentation. Be  sure not to let your dough get too light at any stage of the procedure.    (In other words, dont let the dough go for too long a rise.  If you use  this procedure and watch your dough texture/height, there is no reason why  this should not work, and want the joy of doing it yourself.) -- >From:  Katie E Green <kgreen@u.washington.edu>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Fredericksburg Home Kitchen Cook Book  NOTES : This is from the Fredericksburg Home Kitchen Cook Book,       first published in 1846.  I Have the Centennial Edition, 1946.       Great       find, a bit pricey, in the book stalls.  There are two yeast       recipes,       followed by a Buttermilk Bread recipe.  These are old recipes, but       my       grandmother made her own yeast on the farm and followed the same       procedure       in Iowa, turn of the century.
