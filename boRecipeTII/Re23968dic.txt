CREPES: Combine flour & salt in mixing bowl.  Make a well in the centre &  pour in the soymilk & oil.  Beat till smooth.  Heat a 6 or 7-inch skillet.  when hot, pour in 1/4 c of batter & tilt skillet till its evenly coated.  Cook over moderate heat till lightly browned on the bottom. Flip & brown  the other side.  Remove & set on a plate. Repeat with the rest of the  batter, you should have 6 crepes. SAUCE: Heat margarine in a small pot. Add  onion & garlic & saute over moderate heat till onion is golden. Add  mushrooms & cover.  Cook till the mushrooms are limp & juicy. Sprinkle in  the flour & stir till it disappears. Slowly pour in the soymilk, stirring.  Bring to a simmer, then stir in the dill & tarragon. Cook at a simmer till  the sauce thickens. Stir in the lemon juice & season to taste. Remove from  heat & cover. FILLING: Trim about 1/2-inch of the asparagus stalks & scrape  off any tough looking skin. Cut stalks in half & steam till tender crisp.  ASSEMBLE:  Place 6 asparagus stalks in the centre of each crepe, letting  the tips protrude from the top & overlapping the halved stalks in the  centre if necessary.  Spoon a very small amount of sauce over the  asparagus.  fold one end of the crepe in towards the centre & overlap the  other end over it.  Arrange the crepes, folded side down, in an oiled,  shallow baking dish.  Spoon remaining sauce evenly over the crepes. Bake in  a preheated 350F oven until just heated through. Serve at once.
