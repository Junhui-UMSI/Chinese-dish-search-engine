Jamaican Spiced Vegetables
Sweet Corn, Plantain, Sweet Potato, Oil to drizzle, 
These are some pretty good recipes for chileheads.   The original recipes were from Emeril, but I have kicked it UP!  I have used Hbs dried and  powdered for the Jerk Spice mixture. If I had access to Datil Peppers I think that would be the best!      Sprinkle vegetables with spice and drizzle with oil. Grill 5 minutes per side.   Serve with Jamaican Marinated Pork.
