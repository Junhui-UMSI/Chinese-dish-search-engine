Portuguese Sweet Bread (Hawaiian Bread)
Warm milk, Eggs, active dry yeast, Flour, Sugar, potatoes, Ground nutmeg, Warm water, Salt, Butter, 
Combine warm water, yeast and 1/4 cup of the sugar; set aside to proof.  (Proofing is where the yeast grows to prove that it is alive (bubbling,  smelling like beer.) If the yeast is not alive, pitch it and start again.)  Combine the mashed potatoes, warm milk, and salt; add to yeast mixture.  Beat eggs with remaining 1 1/2 cups of the sugar until light. Add melted  butter and nutmeg. Place flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in  the center. Pour in the egg and yeast mixture. Gradually work the liquid  and flour together until a sticky mass is formed. Sprinkle flour on work  area, turn the dough from the bowl on to the floured area and knead until  smooth and elastic. Return dough to bowl and allow to double. Butter four  9x5x3inch loaf pans. Divide dough equally and shape into loaves and place  in pans. Allow the dough to double again. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare an egg wash by beating 1 egg and one half egg shell of cold water.  When loaves are ready to be baked brush with egg was and sprinkle a little  sugar. Place in oven and bake for 45 to 60 minutes. When done , the bread  should sound hollow when tapped on bottom. Remove from oven and place on  racks to cool. (This recipe can be cut in half.)
