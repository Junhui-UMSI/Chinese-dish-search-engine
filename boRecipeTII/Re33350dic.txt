Basic Thin Crust Dough
Salt, Active dry yeast, Lukewarm water, olive oil, Bread flour, 
Bread Machine: Warm liquids to lukewarm, 110*. Add ingredients to your  bread machine in the order specified for your machine. Use dough cycle,  which will knead the dougha nd allow it to rise one time. It is not  necessary to let dough any longer that 1 hour. If your machine has a double  kneading dough cycle (DAK And Welbilt ABM 100), remove the dough after 1  hour or so and turn off your machine. Allowing the dough to knead the  second time causes bubbles which are difficult to roll. Either acative dry  or rapid rise yeast may be used. It is not necessary to proof the yeast in  water; just mix it in with the flour. Note To date I have over thirty five  different pizza dough recipes, Want more e-mail me.
