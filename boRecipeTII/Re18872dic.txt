Andys Italian Cheesecake
Eggs, Sugar, Ricotta Cheese, Vanilla extract, Cream cheese, 
Separate eggs and beat whites stiff.    In a large bowl, thoroughly mix all ingredients except the egg whites. Fold  in the egg whites until just completely mixed.    Butter and lightly flour a 9" spring pan. Pour in the entire mixture.    Bake at 325 degrees F. for 1 hour - do not open oven door. Without opening  oven door, turn off oven and let remain in oven for an additional hour.  Remove from oven; the cheesecake should be lightly browned and should have  several cracks in the center.  The center will also be slightly lower than  the edges. If you do choose to use a glaze, you will see that this  cheesecake forms its own rim. If your oven runs hot or cold, change the  temperature by + or - 25 degrees rather than changing the cooking and idle  time.    Insert knife around sides of pan to insure easy removal of spring pan  sides. Remove the spring pan sides and place cheesecake and bottom of  spring pan on a plate to catch the liquid which will exude during the 3  hours the cheesecake is in the refrigerator. The longer the better in this  case.  Do not cover.    This recipe takes about 5 1/2 hours from start to eating. (Much of it free  time for other tasks).  But it is definitely worth the effort.  Enjoy!
