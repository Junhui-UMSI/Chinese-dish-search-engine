For the Genoise, whisk the eggs, sugar, salt, extract and zest in the bowl  of an electric mixer. Place the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water  and whisk until the mixture is luke-warm. Place on mixer with whip and beat  until cold and increased in volume. Combine remaining ingredients and sift.  Remove egg mixture from mixer and sift the starches in, folding with a  rubber spatula, in 3 additions. Pour the batter into a buttered and  parchment or waxed paper-lined 10 by 2-inch diameter pan. Bake at 350  degrees about 30 minutes. Unmold and cool on a rack.    For the syrup, combine water and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil  over low heat. Cool and add juice and liqueur.    For the filling, combine all ingredients except butter in mixer bowl and  whisk to mix. Place over a pan of simmering water and whisk constantly  until hot and thickened, about 2 minutes. Whip by machine until cooled.  Switch to paddle attachment and beat in butter.    To assemble, divide cake into 3 horizontal layers, using a sharp serrated  knife. Place one layer on a platter or cardboard and moisten with syrup.  Spread with a third of the filling. Repeat with second layer, syrup and  filling. Place last layer on and moisten with remaining syrup. Spread  outside of cake smoothly with remaining filling. Adhere almonds all over  outside of cake. Dust very lightly with confectioners sugar.
