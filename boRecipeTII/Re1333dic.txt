Dutch Babies Aka Puffy Pancakes
Butter or margarine, Eggs, milk, Flour, Granulated sugar, Salt, Powdered sugar, 
Preheat oven to very high heat (450 or 500) Melt 2 tbs. butter in each of 2  9" pie pans. Beat eggs and milk together. Add dty ingredients (except  powdered sugar.) Pour half into each pan. Bake about 20 to 25 minutes. They  puff up beautifully and turn golden brown. Serve immediately with powdered  sugar.    I put fried apples (with brown sugar and cinnamon) in the bottom of the pan  before I pour in the batter. For my kids its a real breakfast treat. And  its relatively quick and easy on a busy school day.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by vshulman@aztec.asu.edu (VICKI L. SHULMAN)  on Aug 26, 1998,
