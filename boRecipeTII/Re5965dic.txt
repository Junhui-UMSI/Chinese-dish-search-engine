Pistachio Truffles Part 1
COATING, Heavy cream, Corn oil, as needed, Pistachio pieces, Vanilla extract, Unsalted butter, TO FINISH, TRUFFLES, White chocolate fine chopped, Semisweet chocolate,, Shelled pistachios, 
Make the truffles: 1. In a food processor, grind the pistachios until a  paste forms. If the nuts are very dry, add the corn oil, 1/2 teaspoon at a  time, with the machine running. The consistency of the paste should be like  dry peanut butter. Set aside.    2. Combine the chopped white chocolate, cream and butter in a  microwave-safe medium bowl. Heat on high power for 1 minute. Remove from  the microwave and stir. If the chocolate is still fairly solid, heat for  another 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. If there still seem to  be several unmelted pieces of chocolate, heat again for about 20 seconds,  and then stir.    3. Add the vanilla and reserved pistachio paste and stir until smooth.    ********************************************************************        TO COMPLETE, FOLLOW "TRUFFLE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS, PART 2"    ********************************************************************    Before freezing, garnish each completed truffle with a piece of pistachio.
