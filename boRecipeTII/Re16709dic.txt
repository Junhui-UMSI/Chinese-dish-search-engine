Its called  "Albanian Chicken", although Ive never seen an Albanian Cookbook, and have  never seen another Albanian recipe, it seems like something my great  grandmother would have cooked. The use of sauerkraut as a stuffing seems  weird, but is characteristic of Middle European cooking. You often find it  mixed with apples...here its mixed with paprika and caraway seeds. The  stuffing is sensationally delicious, and the chicken comes out extremely  tender, every time. This is a recipe you have to cook to understand.    Saute onion in oil until golden, stirring often. Combine sauerkraut,  paprika, and caraway seeds with onion. Spoon as much kraut mixture as  possible into the body cavity of the chicken. Reserve remainder of kraut  for later    Place chicken on roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 325  degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Remove pan from oven, take chicken out. Pour off  fat in bottom of pan. Spread remaining kraut in bottom of pan and set  chicken in pan. Bake another 1/2 to 1 hour to brown. Season as desired.    Leftovers make great sliced chicken and sauerkraut sandwiches.    (If your mail program renders the times weird looking, theyre 1.5 hurs for  baking, and .5 to 1 hour for browning.
