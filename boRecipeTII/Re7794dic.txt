Notes: From Orange County Register.    Cooks notes: Canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce are sold at Hispanic  markets and some supermarkets.    Preliminaries: Heat oven to 400 degrees.    1. Use 1 tablespoon olive oil to brush on both a baking sheet and on  rounded sides of mushrooms. Place mushrooms rounded side down in a single  layer on prepared sheet.    2. Puree chipotle chilies and oyster sauce in either a blender or food  processor fitted with the metal blade. Lightly brush mixture on the gills  (the inside of the bowl of the mushroom). Remember that the chipotles  (smoked ripened jalapenos) are spicy.    3. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion, bell peppers and chili. Cook until onions and peppers are  softened. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. Spoon mixture  into mushrooms.    4. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes. Sprinkle on cheese and bake 2-3  more minutes.    Presentation: Allow mushrooms to rest for 3-5 minutes before serving.    If serving as an appetizer, cut large portobellos into pie-shaped wedges.  Small portobello pizzas can be served whole. They make a great garnish for  tossed green salads.
