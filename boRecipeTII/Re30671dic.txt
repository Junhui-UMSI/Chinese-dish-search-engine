Tamales - Eric Freeman
Dried corn husks (I used La, Canola oil, Frozen corn, MASA HARINA (MASA corn flour, Approximately 1/2 cup water, 15oz can Hunts ready tomato, Carrots; chopped finely, NOT corn meal!), Baking Powder, Hot sauce (your favorite), Salsa (your favorite), 
Soak corn husks for 3 hours in water. This recipe makes 6-8 tamales, so you  will need about 1 "cluster" of corn husks. Combine the chunky chili,  carrots, corn, salsa and hot sauce in a pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce  heat and simmer for 30 minutes.    In the mean time, combine MASA and baking powder in a large bowl; mix well.  Add the oil, and mix with your fingers or a spatula. Then slowly add water  until the mixture forms a dough. To test the dough, roll some into a small  ball. The dough should hold together and not crumble. Remove the corn husks  from the soaking water and dry off. For each tamale, line a corn husk with  a thin layer of the dough. Place 1-2 tablespoons of sauce on the dough and  roll the husk to seal the edges of the tamale. Fold the husk over the  tamale, fold the ends up and use a small strip of husk to tie around each  end.    Steam the tamales for 45 mins - 1 hour. While the tamales are cooking,  continue to simmer the remaining sauce. Serve hot with some of the  remaining sauce on top.
