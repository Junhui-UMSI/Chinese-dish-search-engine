Put vegetable flakes in blender and buzz until powdered. In a bowl, stir  all ingredients except water until blended. Add water; stir until blended  and a smooth dough forms.  Divide in half, cover and let stand 10 minutes.  Place half the dough on lightly oiled 17 x 14 inch baking sheet and roll  out to edges (dough will be very thin). Use extra flour as needed to keep  the dough from sticking to the rolling pin. Prick all over with a fork and  cut in 1 1/2 inch squares. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes or until  crisp but not too brown. Remove to racks to cool. Repeat with remaining  dough.
