All the talk of posole inspired me, and while I can certainly take the  heat, I sometimes like a dish thats MILD and flavorful. So heres what I  made for dinner tonight:    In a well-oiled 9" pan or skillet, mix all well.  Sprinkle with several  tbsp. of water and bake uncovered at 400" for about 25-30 minutes.  Enjoy...its good cold the next morning, too.    rain@hothouse.iglou.com    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
