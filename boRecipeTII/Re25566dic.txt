Avocado in Tarragon Cream Dressing
SALAD-----, DRESSING-----, Sugar, Lettuce leaves -- Bibb, Paprika, Vinegar -- tarragon, Avocadoes, Eggs, Or, Cream -- heavy, Boston, 
In a bowl add sugar to eggs and gradually pour in vinegar.    Stand the bowl in a pan of boiling water and stir until the mixure begins  to thicken, then turn off the heat and continue to stir.    When the mixure is thick, remove bowl from pan and continue stirring for  one minute. Season and cool.    Whip the cream till it holds a soft shape.    Place 3 lettuce leaves on a plate. Halve, seed, peel the avocados. Place  avocado half on the leaves round side up.    Fold the cream into the dressing. Coat avocados with the dressing. Sprinkle  with paprika and serve.    Toms comments: I find the vinegar taste to be overwhelming. You may want  to remove one tb of vinegar or double-triple the sugar. The vinegar taste  does lessen with time, but I would not want to bet a meal on doing things  that way. I WILL do this again (I like it!) and shall try the things I  stated above.
