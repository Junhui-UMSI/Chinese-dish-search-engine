Angel Food Cake
Almond extract, Granulated sugar, Unbleached flour, sifted, Egg whites, slightly beaten, Salt, Pure vanilla extract, Powdered sugar, sifted, Cream of tartar, 
Preheat oven to 375. In a mixing bowl, combine powdered sugar and flour;  set aside.  In another mixing bowl,  with mixer at high speed, beat egg  whites, cream of tartar, vanilla extract, salt, and almond extract until  well blended. Beating at high speed, gradually sprinkle in granulated  sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time. Beat just until sugar is dissolved and egg  whites stand in stiff peaks. Do not scrape sides of bowl during beating.  With rubber spatula, fold in flour mixture, about 1/4 at a time, just until  flour disappears. Pour mixture in unprepared 10" tube pan. With metal  spatula, cut through batter to break large air bubbles. Bake for 35  minutes. Remove from oven and set upside-down until cooled. Notes: To  freeze, place unfrosted cake in a freezer bag or airtight container. Seal,  label, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature about 3  hours.
