Potato Appetizer
Red New Potatoes, Sour cream, Red Caviar, 
Source: The caterer at a Bar Mitzvah about 20 years ago.    Boil potatoes (unpeeled). Let cool. Cut potatoes in half and, with a melon  baller, scoop out some of the potato from the center. Fill the hollow with  sour cream and sprinkle caviar on top. I am not a big caviar fan so, when I  make this I finely mince some lox and sprinkle that on top instead. Has  always been a big hit.
