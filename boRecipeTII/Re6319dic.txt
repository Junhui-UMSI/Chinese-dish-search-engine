Richard G. Sackleh, executive chef, sent the recipe. It includes a spicy  sweet Thai sauce.    Prepare Thai sauce and set aside. Place butter and garlic in clean, heated  saute pan. Cook 1 minute. Add shrimp, cook 3 minutes, turning occasionally  to cook evenly. Add additional butter if pan becomes too dry.    Add cut vegetables, half of the cilantro and half of the peanuts. Add 1/2  cup Thai sauce (or more to taste) and mix.    Add shrimp/vegetable mixture to pasta, tossing well to coat. Remove shrimp  from mixture.    Divide pasta with vegetables and sauce between 2 serving bowls. Place  reserved shrimp, tails up, around rims of bowls, facing toward middle.  Garnish center of each bowl with the onions, remaining peanuts and  cilantro. Makes 2 servings.    Note: Additional Thai sauce can be added to this dish or remaining sauce  can be refrigerated 4 to 5 days and used in another dish.    Thai sauce: Place all ingredients except crushed red pepper in blender and  blend well. Place in storage container. Mix in crushed pepper. Use 1/2 cup  or more to make Thai Shrimp Pasta, and refrigerate remaining sauce. Sauce  keeps 4 to 5 days.    Note: Hoisin sauce and sweet chili sauce are available at Asian specialty  stores.
