Heavy cream, Scoops vanilla ice cream, Firm pears; preferably, Chocolate sauce, Confectioners sugar, Lemon; halved, Triple Sec liqueur, Medium-strength Earl Grey, Vanilla extract, 
Bring tea to a simmer in an enameled or stainless steel saucepan over  medium heat. Cut each pear in half. Peel, core, & immediately rub the  surface with lemon. Place the pear halves in the hot tea & poach for 3 - 4  minutes on each side, or until tender but firm. Some varieties of pear will  poach faster than others, so keep an eye on them. Remove from the tea with  slotted spoon & set aside to cool. In separate saucepan, slowly heat  chocolate sauce. Stir in Triple Sec; keep warm. Whip heavy cream to soft  peaks. Add the vanilla extract & confectioners sugar & whip to stiff  peaks. Place one pear half on each of four cold serving plates, hollowed  side up. Place two scoops of ice cream on each pear half. Drizzle each pear  with 1/2 cup of the heated chocolate sauce & immediately top with a  generous dollop of whipped cream.    PETIT CAFE    N.E. 55TH STREET, SEATTLE.
