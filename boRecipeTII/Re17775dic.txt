>From 365 Quick and Easy Microwave Recipes by Thelma Pressman    Combine buttermilk and baking soda in a 3 quart casserole. Stir well until  soda completely dissolves. Stir in sugar and corn syrup. Add butter. Cook  on HIGH 3 minutes or until boiling. Remove from microwave.    Stir fudge with a metal spoon. Place a sheet of microwave safe plastic wrap  over 3/4 of casserole. If using microwave candy thermometer (PREFERRED  METHOD), clip it onto open edge of casserole. Continue to cook on HIGH 14  minutes or until thermometer registers 245 degrees. If no thermometer, a  small amount dropped into a glass of cold water should mass together. Let  cool until thickened, about 45 minutes.    Beat in almonds, pecans and vanilla. Turn fudge out into a generously  greased 8 inch square pan. Let stand 30 minutes, or until firm. Cut into 1      1/2    inch squares.
