White Elephant Scottish Scones
Baking Powder, Salt, Cold unsalted butter; sliced, All-purpose flour, Granulated sugar, Half and half, 
Heat oven to 425? F.    Place flour in a bowl and add sliced butter; cut in with a pastry blender  until mixture looks like fine granules. Add sugar; toss to mix.    Add cream and stir with a fork until a soft dough forms. Form dough into a  ball, turn onto a lightly-floured board and knead 10 to 12 times. Work the  dough as little as possible.    Cut dough in half. Knead each half lightly into a ball and turn smooth side  up. Pat or roll into a 6-inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 to 8 wedges.  Bake wedges on an ungreased cookie sheet -- slightly apart for crisp sides;  touching for soft sides.    For round scones, roll out dough to about 12 x 5 inches; cut out 15 scones  with a 2-inch cutter.    Bake about 12 minutes or until medium brown on top. Cool on rack or serve  hot on linen cloth. Serve with butter and honey or jam.    Uncooked scones can be frozen on a cookie sheet, then put in a plastic bag.  Bake frozen scones at 425? F until lightly browned.    Recipe makes 12-16 triangles or 18 2-inch rounds.    Recipe by: White Elephant B & B Inn, Savannah, TN    Posted to recipelu-digest by "Crane C. Walden" <cranew@foothill.net> on Feb  8, 1998
