A Valium
3oz can, Limeade, Cream of coconut, 15oz  can, Vodka, Pineapple juice, Can, 
Mix together in large plastic bowl , place in freezer for 24 hours stirring  after 12 hours(it will become slushy).  When ready to serve place 2  scoops(If you use an ice cream scoop this works well) into glass and fill  with chilled 7-up or sprite.  This tastes great.
