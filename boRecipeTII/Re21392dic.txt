Reconstitute the "chicken" according to Dixies instructions. Make sure you  cook them for at least 10 minutes medium setting in your microwave. Keep  them covered to steam them. Folks, remember, these are not real chicken,  but 100% soy.You need to pour off the "gravy" from the chicken or the  recipe will be too runny.    Let the "chicken"stand for about 15 minutes after steaming, or they might  remain excessively chewy--unless you like them that way.    Combine the rest of the ingredients and add the chicken last.    Cool in the refrigerator. You can experiment with seasonings. This recipe  will probably fool your SAD friends. I know some vegan people who will not  eat it, because it is "too close" to real chicken salad.    Some of you may have some comfort food examples of chicken salad as a  family recipe. But this one is very close to the real thing. Posted to  fatfree digest V97 #172 by "Michael M. Rosenblatt" <podtrst@isomedia.com>  on Jul 29, 1997
