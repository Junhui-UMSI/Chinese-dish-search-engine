Sugar, Baking Powder, Salt, Flour, Baking soda, Egg, Buttermilk, Cardamom, 
Beat yolks of eggs with buttermilk.    Mix together sugar, salt, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and cardamom.    Beat egg whites until stiff.    Mix egg yolk-buttermilk mixture with dry ingredients. Add egg whites,  carefully folding them in so that they dont break down.    Heat aebleskive pan. Put 1 tsp salad oil in each hole and fill completely  with batter. Let bake until slightly crusty on bottom. Turn slightly with a  knitting needle or skewer. Continue cooking, turning the ball to keep it  from burning, until the knitting needle comes out clean when stuck in the  center.    Serve aebleskive hot with powdered sugar, jam, and jelly.    Notes included with recipe: For those of you who are unfamiliar with  aebleskive, it is a baked delight made with a pancake-like batter, cooked  in a special pan that turns the aebleskive into a crusty ball, and is known  as the "Danish Doughnut." As you can tell, it is a little difficult to give  aebleskive an easy definition other than to tell you that it is good enough  to go ahead and order the pans if you are likely to serve breakfasts and  brunches to family and friends.    Aebleskive pans are available through most gourmet cookware shops or can be  ordered from Pea Soup Andersens Santa Ynez Valley Wine Center,  (805)-688-5581.
