(Recipe by Jacqueline H. McMahan adapted from chili served at the Inn of  the Anasazi, Santa Fe, NM)    Heat oil, add meat (in batches) and sear.  Remove and set aside.  When all  meat is seared, return to pot.  Add remaining ingredients except masa  harina. Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes. Stir in  masa harina. Serve with warm corn tortillas.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #238    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
