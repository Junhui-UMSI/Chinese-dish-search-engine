Carnitas has a wonderful flavor. The unique style of cooking creates a  flavor that cannot be duplicated any other way. This meat is good to make  tamales and is also wonderful in wraps!    Place pork, water, Chile Caribe, salt, garlic, and onion in a heavy pot.  (COPPER is the best like the one for making candy in) Bring to a slow  simmer    Roast spices and oregano in a dry saucepan over medium heat until fragrant,  you know when you start sneezing!    Add this to the pork and simmer on low for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until tender.  Increase the heat until all liquid is gone. Reduce heat a little and  continue cooking and stirring until the cubes of meat are a rich mahogany  brown.    Let the Carnitas cool.    Make tamales!
