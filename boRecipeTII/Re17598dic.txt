Almond Jelly
Envelopes, Note, milk, Almond extract, Sugar, Chilled canned fruit -- see, Unflavored gelatin, Water, 
Note: try lychee nuts, mandarin oranges, fruit cocktail, etc.    Pour unflavored gelatin slowly over water.  Cook for 3 minutes.  Add  remaining ingredients, except fruit.  Cook one minute.  Pour into flat pan.  Chill for 6 hours or overnight. Cut into 3/4 inch cubes. To serve place  cubes in individual dessert cups.  Spoon chilled fruit and canned juices  over cubes. (Note: for me lychees and mandarin oranges are a necessity).
