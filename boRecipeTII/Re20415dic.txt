Vegan Cornbread
Yellow cornmeal, Whole Wheat Flour, Maple syrup, Apple sauce (unsweetened), Rice Drink, Baking Powder, Egg Replacer, Salt, 
Im still experimenting with the amound of liquid. It may need to be bumped  up a little because of the action of the Energ Egg Replacer. The next batch  I bake will have 1/4 cup more of the Harmony Farms drink.    Ive recently replaced all of my bakeware with Bakers Secret from  Eckoware. All of my old stock was sticky from using "no fat" sprays. Now  all of my bakeware looks like it did the day I bought them. NO FAT has ever  been put in or on those pans.
