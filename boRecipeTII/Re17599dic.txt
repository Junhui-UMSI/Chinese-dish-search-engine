Almond Joy Cake
Undiluted Pet evaporated, Chocolate pudding cake mix;, FROSTING, Marshmallows, FILLING, Undiluted Pet evaporated, Nuts; optional, Sugar, Chocolate chips, Sticks margarine, Coconut, 
NOTE Regarding Pet evaporated milk: PET is a brand of evaporated milk. I  use other brands with equal success in this cake. For those of you who do  not have access to the chocolate pudding cake mixes, any moist chocolate  cake baked from scratch will work equally well.    CAKE--Prepare cake mix as directed and bake.    FILLING--Heat 1 cup milk, sugar, and marshmallows until melted; add  coconut. While cake is hot, cover completely with filling. Let set while  preparing frosting.    FROSTING--In saucepan heat 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup milk and margarine  until it starts to boil; add chocolate chips. Stir until melted; add nuts,  if desired. Pour over cake.    >From Carole: This is a tried and true cake and very rich. I bake the cake  in a 9X13 sheet cake pan. Make sure the pan is deep enough to hold all  three layers. After frosting the cake, I place almonds over the cake,  insuring that when cut, each serving includes an almond. You can use either  slivered or whole. It really does taste like an almond joy! I found this  recipe in the Oklahoma Christian College Womens Association of OKC 1985  Cookbook. Enjoy!    Typed for you by Carole Jarvis on 10/27/97 and formatted with MC_Buster.
