FOR BAKED CHICKEN     Place 1/4 c. Baking Mix per cut up chicken  in brown paper bag.  Skin  chicken pieces and wash in cold water;  blot dry with paper towels. Moisten  chicken with tomato juice or skim milk--were talking damp, not wet.  Put  all chicken pieces in bag at once;  close bag, trapping air inside, and  shake until all pieces are coated.  Add more mix, if necessary.  Arrange  chicken on a cooling rack to dry 15 minutes while oven preheats to 450  degrees.     Spray a shallow roasting pan liberally with cooking spray or grease with  mixture of lecithin and oil. Arrange chicken pieces skin-side down and bake  on lower rack of oven 15 minutes. Turn chicken and continue baking 20  minutes until tender, golden brown, and no longer pink inside.    FOR BAKED FISH     Rinse fish fillets and blot dry.  Cut into small portions or sticks.  Combine 1 egg white and 2 T. skim milk;  pour baking mix into shallow dish  or plate.  Dip fish pieces in milk mixture, then press into baking mix to  coat.  Arrange on lightly greased baking sheet and let dry 10 minutes while  oven is preheating to 425 degrees.  Bake about 15 minutes.
