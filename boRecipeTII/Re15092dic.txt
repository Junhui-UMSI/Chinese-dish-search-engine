This rub resembles a paste that is "packed" onto the chicken. Use an  electric coffee grinder to grind whole allspice and nutmeg; freshly ground  spices will give much more flavor than bottled ones. Be sure to wear gloves  when you handle the chile peppers and pack on the rub; the oil in the  chiles will burn your skin. Substitute 2 to 3 serrano chile peppers for the  Scotch bonnet peppers, if desired.
