Asparagi Di Campo (Cold Marinated Asparagus)
Capers, Salt, Mint leaf, Onion, Lemon juice, salt and pepper, asparagus, 
Place onion & salt in a bowl large enough to hold the asparagus. Mix well &  let steep for 30 minutes.  Add the capers, lemon juice & mint leaf &  marinate for at least 1 hour. Mix thoroughly from time to time. Meanwhile,  bring an asparagus cooker to a boil & cook the asparagus until tender but  still crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain. Toss the still warm asparagus with the  marinade & add salt & pepper.  Toss gently & serve.
