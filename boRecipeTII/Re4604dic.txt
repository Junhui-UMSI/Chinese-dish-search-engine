Sift flour with spices and soda. Set aside.  In large bowl, using an  electric beater at high speed, beat eggs and brown sugar until light (about  five minutes). At low speed, beat in flour mixture and nuts. Mix until  well-combined.  Dough will be *sticky*.  With wet hands, pinch dough by  tablespoonsful and roll into 1-inch balls. Place on lightly greased cookie  sheets and bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on wire rack.    While the cookies are cooling, combine sugar with cream of tartar and water  in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar  dissolves. Boil without stirring for five minutes or until sugar forms a  two-inch thread when dropped from the spoon (235 degrees on the candy  thermometer).    Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat egg whites  until stiff peaks form. Pour syrup into egg whites in a continuous stream,  beating constantly. Beat together until mixture is slightly thickened.    Drop the cooled cookies, a few at a time, into the glaze. With a fork, turn  to coat completely. Lift out and place on a wire rack to dry or,  preferably, roll in a shallow bowl of sifted confectioners sugar for a  final dusting of crunchy, snowlike frosting.  Store in a tighly covered  container at least a week before using.                                Philadelphia Inquirer, 12/14/88
