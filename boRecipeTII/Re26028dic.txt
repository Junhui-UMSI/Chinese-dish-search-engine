Tofu Curry
Peanut oil, firm tofu, ginger, Madras curry powder, garlic, Habanero, Onion, coconut milk, Fish soy, Jalapeno chile, 
Press water from block of tofu, by wrapping in paper towel and  weighting(Iuse a brick) for at least half an hour or longer, drier is  better...cut into inch cubes and deep fry in about quarter cup of peanut  oil, until slightly browned, remove as you do them and drain on paper  towel. Set the tofu aside while you prepare the curry. Take a skillet at  least 10" and put on medium heat, add onion, garlic, ginger and the peppers  to the one tbls of peanut oil...cover and cook on LOW heat until onion is  soft...sprinkle with the curry powder and cook another five minutes, add  fish sauce, and half of the can of coconut milk, simmer for another 5 - 10  minutes, add drained tofu and the rest of the coconut milk...taste for  seasoning, add sugar, about 1 teaspoon or more to taste, and you may need  to thicken the sauce if it is too thin...do this with a little cornstarch  and water mix...I have been doing this one for so long I just a*d to the  consistency that I want to have...a very nice curry, serve with chopped  cilantro and sprinkle with more dessicated coconut.
