Wine Cake #2
Eggs, Instant vanilla pudding, Yellow or white cake mix, Cooking oil, Freshly grated nutmeg, Sherry or muscatel wine, 
Combine all ingredients and mix well with a mixer, beating for 5 minutes  on medium speed. Pour into a greased and floured bundt or tube pan. Bake at  350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in pan 20 minutes; turn out.  Sometimes I use lemon instant pudding in place of vanilla and add 1/2  teaspoon cinnamon.     Note: Good warm. Does not need frosting or glazing. Freezes well.
