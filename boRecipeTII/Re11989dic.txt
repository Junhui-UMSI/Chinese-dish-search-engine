PREPARE THE TART DOUGH. If you are using unyeasted crust, partially prebake  it. Halve the peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and veins, then halve  them crosswise and slice very thinly. Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil  in a wide pan, add the peppers, onion, half the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon  salt. Saute over medium-high heat for several minutes, then lower the heat,  add the water or white wine, cover and stew until the peppers and onion are  very soft and sweet. If the peppers and onion threaten to stick as the  sugars are released, add additional small amounts of water or wine. Taste  for salt, and season with freshly ground black pepper when the peppers and  onion are finished cooking. Put 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a blender  jar with the remaining garlic and a few of the basil leaves and puree.  Gradually add the rest of the basil leaves, using more oil if necessary.  Scrape the puree out of the jar, stir in the Parmesan or Romano cheese and  season with salt. If using the yeasted tart dough, prepare the shell, then  make the custard. Beat the eggs and yolks together, then add the cream, 1/2  teaspoon salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 400F. Paint the crust with  the basil puree, then lay half the grated Provolone cheese on top, followed  by the peppers and onion, and the olives. Add the remaining cheese, then  the custard. Bake the tart in the center of the oven until it is golden  brown, and set, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the tart rest 5 to 10 minutes before  serving.    DEBORAH MADISON - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
