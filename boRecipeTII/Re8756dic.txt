Pousse Cafe
Creme Yvette, Creme de menthe, Yellow chartreuse, Grenadine, 
Into a Pousse Cafe glass, carefully pour equal parts of the above  ingredients in order shown so that each ingredient floats on top of  preceding one. The liquids will float more readily if you gently pour each  liquid over the back of a spoon resting on top of the glass.
