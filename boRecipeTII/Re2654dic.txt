I dont have the name for this but it came off of Good Morning  America...and looked fabulous....It is a peanut butter and chocolate  pie......YUM!    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, combine the cookie crust  with 1 tablespoon of the peanut butter. Combine the mixture thoroughly and  press into a 9-inch springform pan. Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes. In an  electric mixer with a whip attachment, whip the cream cheee and sugar until  smooth. Add the remaining 1 cup peanut butter, milk and nuts and whip for 1  minute. Turn the peanut butter mixture into a mixing bowl. Whip 2 cups of  the heavy cream and fold into the peanut butter mixture. Pour the filling  into the prepared crust and refrigerate for 2 hours or until the pie is  set. In a sauce pan, over medium heat, melt the chocolate with the  remaining cream, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is completely  melted. Remove from the heat and cool for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Remove the pie from the springform pan and place on a wire rack over a  baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Pour the chocolate topping over  the pie, covering the top and sides completely. Refrigerate the pie for 2  hours or unti the chocolate coating is set.    Yield: 1 pie    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 16, 1998
