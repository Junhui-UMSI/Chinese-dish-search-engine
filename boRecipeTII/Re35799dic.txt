Its  from the New York Times Cookbook (with a few minor alterations).    Boil the eggplants in a kettle of water, covered, for 15 minutes.  Drain  and cut in half lengthwise. Carefully remove the pulp, leaving a shell of  1/2 inch thick. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a skillet, heat the  oil, add the onions, garlic, and green pepper and saute til just tender.  Remove to a bowl. Saute the beef until it loses its pink color. Drain and  add to the bowl. Chop the eggplant pulp and combine with the sauteed  mixture.  Add remaining ingredients except tomato sauce and mix well. Fill  the eggplant shells with the mixture and place in a greased baking pan.  Brush tops with additional oil and bake about 45 minutes. Serve with tomato  sauce.    **I browned the beef and put the vegetables in together to save time.  I  took it off the heat to add the other ingredients.    **I served the marinara sauce on the side at the table so everyone could  add their own.
