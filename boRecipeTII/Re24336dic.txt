Triple Muffin Mix
Baking soda, Baking Powder, Cinnamon, Raisins*, All purpose flour, Brown sugar, Sugar, Each nutmeg, allspice,, Salt, 
Combine all dry ingredients, stir in raisins. Keep in ziplock bag or sealed  tupperware in the fridge. * We use dried sweetened cranberries since hubby  hates raisins.    For six muffins: (double for 12)    Combine 1 egg, 1/4c vegetable oil, and *ONE of the following: 3/4c mashed  bananas, OR 3/4c applesauce, OR 1/2c pumpkin mixed with 1/4c water. Stir in  1 1/2c muffin mix. Spoon into greased muffin cups. Bake at 350 for 20-25  minutes. *We have also had good results with canned crushed pineapple.
