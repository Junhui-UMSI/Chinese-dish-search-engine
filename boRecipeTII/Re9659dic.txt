Pumpkin Muffins #1
Cinnamon & nutmeg to taste, Dough from "Bran Muffins, Pureed pumpkin, 
Using my recipe for Bran Muffins the Frugal Way (see recipe), prepare  pumpkin and bran muffins by simply adding a bit of canned pumpkin to the  dough. Two cups of freshly mixed dough will call for about 1/2 cup of  pur?ed pumpkin. Add some cinnamon and nutmeg if you like. Let the batter  sit in the refrigerator until the next day. The muffins will take a bit  longer to cook and they will be a bit heavier due to the pumpkin. Heavy or  not, the flavor of the muffins is very comforting.
