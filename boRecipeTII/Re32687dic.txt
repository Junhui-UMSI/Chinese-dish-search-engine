Rub them lightly with salad oil and  bake in a 450 oven for 35 minutes. Allow them to cool, then peel and dice  into 1-inch cubes. Wash the peaches, remove the pits, peel off the skin,  and dice as for the potatoes. Butter a 3-quart baking dish and preheat the  oven to 375.    2. In a saucepan, combine the potatoes, peaches, water, syrup, salt,  pepper, and brandy. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes, or until  the liquid in the pan begins to turn quite thick. Remove the potato and the  peach segments with a slotted spoon and put some of them in a layer in the  prepared baking dish. Pour some of the syrup fro, the pan over the layer.  Cut the butter into small pieces and use about 6 pieces to dot the layer,  then sprinkle with some of the cinnamon and nutmeg. Repeat the layers until  all the peach and potato mixture is used up. Cover the top with the  remaining butter and a bit more syrup than the other layers. Bake uncovered  in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top turns brown  and the liquid in the baking dish is well candied.    3. Serve hot with lots of whipped cream.
