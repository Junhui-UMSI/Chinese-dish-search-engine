Pork Chop and Zucchini Casserole
Milk; heated, Grated Mozzarella cheese, Dry mustard, Butter or oil; (up to 2), Onions; thinly sliced, Sweet potatoes; peeled,, Flour, Salt, Several grinds of pepper, Zucchini (3 or 4); sliced, Centre loin pork chops; 1, Dried thyme, 
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Heat the butter or oil in a "stove to the oven"  baking dish. Put in the pork chops fat edge down, to render some of the fat  as a supplement to whats in the pan. Then sear the chops on both sides.  Remove them briefly to a plate and pour off the fat into a saucepan.    Layer into the baking dish, first the onions and then the sweet potatoes  (use a processor to get the thinnest slices). Lay the chops on top of the  vegetables.    Now blend the flour into the fat in the saucepan, adding more butter or oil  if needed. Whisk in the warm milk and add the mustard, thyme, salt, and  pepper. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Pour  over the chops. Cover and bake for 1 hour, then strew the zucchini slices  over the pork. Sprinkle with the mozzarella and bake, uncovered, another 15  minutes. Serves 6.
