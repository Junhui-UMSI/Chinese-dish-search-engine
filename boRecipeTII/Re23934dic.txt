Seeing I havent posted in quite a while, I thought that I would post  lowfat from the Taste of Home Lowfat Country Cooking. Out of 455 recipes I  only have 44 formatted. Plan on formatting the rest this week. Hope you all  enjoy these.    Cook asparagus in a small amount of water until tender. Drain, reserving  1/4 cup liquid. Cool. Puree asparagus until smooth. Add 1 cup sour cream  and the cream cheese; blend well. In a saucepan, combine gelatin and  reserved liquid; heat slowly until the gelatin is dissolved. Remove from  the heat; stir in the asparagus mixture, ham, chives and pepper. Pour into  a 1-quart round-bottom bowl coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and  chill until set, about 6 hours. Unmold onto a plate and spread with  reserved sour cream. Garnish with additional ham and asparagus if desired.  Serve with crackers.

It  received such great comments that Ive been making it ever since. The  asparagus and ham pair nicely with smooth sour cream and cream cheese.
