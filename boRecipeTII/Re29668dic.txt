It captured my interest  because of the annotated comments beside the recipes. The original owner  had made comments or just check marks beside certain recipes. I will  include these as I scan. This one had no rating.    Recipe by: The Pillsbury Family Cookbook (1963)    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #932 by "Eugene Johnston"  <ejohnston@mailexcite.com> on Nov 29, 1997
