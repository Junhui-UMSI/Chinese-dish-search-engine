1. Sift the 1-1/3 cup flour with the salt into a large mixing bowl. Cut in  the solid margarine or butter with pastry blender until mixture is the size  of small peas. 2. Sprinkle 4-5 tablespoons water, a little at a time, over  the flour while stirring with a fork, until mixture is just moist enough to  hold together. 3. Form into a square and flatten to 1/2 inch. Roll out on  floured surface to 12 inch square. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. 4. Toss  sliced apples with 1 tablespoon of flour. Place slices down center third of  dough. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar over apples. 5. Fold up about 1/2  inch at each end. Fold sides over apples, leaving an inch of apples showing  down center. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar and sliced almonds. 6. Bake  in preheated 450-degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. 7.  Spread immediately with preserves. If preferred, omit the preserves and  frost with a thin glaze made of powdered sugar thinned with milk and  vanilla or orange extract.
