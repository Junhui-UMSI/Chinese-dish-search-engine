In food processor or mixer bowl, combine flour, sugar and cornstarch for  pastry.  Add butter and process (or mix) until dough holds together.  Divide into thirds.  Roll out two-thirds of dough on a baking sheet (13" x  17") to reach all corners evenly.  Prick with fork.  Bake in 350 F. oven  for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, roll out remaining dough between sheets of  plastic wrap or waxed paper to a rectangle about half the size (9" x 13")  of baking sheet.  Cut into long strips about 1/4 inch wide.  Combine eggs,  brown sugar, juices, lemon peel and vanilla for filling in processor or  mixer bowl.  Blend well.  Add figs, dates and nuts to bowl (if using  mixer, then finely chop first).  Process until evenly minced.  Spread  filling over baked pastry; top with strips of dough, crisscrossing  diagonally.  Return to oven and bake for 30 minutes, until pastry strips  are lightly browned.  Cool.  Cut into small bars.
