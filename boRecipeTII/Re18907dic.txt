Add salt to egg whites and beat until foamy; add cream  of tartar and continue beating until stiff but not dry. Fold in the sugar,  one tablespoon at a time, then the flour in the same manner. Add  flavorings. Bake in an angel cake (tube) pan in a 275 F. oven for 30  minutes, then increase the heat to 300 F. after the cake has risen to its  full height, and bake 15 minutes longer or until the cake shrinks slightly  and is well browned. Remove from oven and invert pan until cake is cold.  Remove from pan and ice if desired. The cake in the illustration is iced  with Boiled Icing tinted yellow, and settled in a nest of coconut tinted  green. The breen leaves are mode with green icing. The flowers are cut from  marshmallows, and tinted with violet coloring.    Boiled icing: Mix sugar, cream of tartar and water and cook over low heat  until syrup spins a thread (240 F). Meanwhile, add salt to egg whites and  beat with a flat beater until stiff. Pour syrup in a thin stream over the  egg whites; add flavorings. Beat until the right consistency to spread.
