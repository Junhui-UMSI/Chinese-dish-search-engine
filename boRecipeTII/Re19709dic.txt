While pasta is cooking,  combine pepper strips, artichoke hearts, cheese, mushrooms, onion and basil  in a large bowl.    When pasta is done, drain and rinse with cold water. Drain well and add  pasta and dressing to bowl; toss well. Cover; refrigerate at least 1 hour  before serving.    Posted to MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #142
