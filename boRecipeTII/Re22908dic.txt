Arancia Genovese
Italian ice; any flavor, or, Creme de Cacao, Whipping cream; whipped, Galliano, Oranges, 
1. Cut off top and bottom of each orange to a thickness of 1/4 in. Set  aside tops and bottoms.    2. Using a paring knife, separate rind from pulp by inserting knife between  rind and pulp and cutting with a rotating motion. When properly separated,  pulp should easily slip out by pressing with fingers, leaving hollowed  orange rind intact. Discard pulp.    3. Through top opening of rind, replace bottom rind disc so that rind will  hold filling.    4. Fill each rind with Italian ice or spumoni.    5. Using any kitchen utensil, make a hole in center of ice or spumoni about  the width of a finger. Fill with Galliano.    6. Top with 1 in. to 2 in. whipped cream.    7. Make a similar hole in whipped cream and fill with Creme de Cacao.    8. Cap with reserved rind tops. Serve immediately.
