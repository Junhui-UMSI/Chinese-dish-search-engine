Black mustard seeds, Methi (fenugreek), Dried red chillies, Sesame oil, Hing, Cucumber, Tamcon paste, Salt, Urad dal, white, 
Peel cucumber, slit into half, scoop out seeds. Slit into further narrow  strips and cut tiny pieces as for kachumbar. Should not be grated as this  gives no bite feel in the mouth.    Next, warm the oil and fry all ingredients except the tamarind. Mustard  should stop spluttering and dal/methi should turn brown. Drain out these  fried spices into a blender, leaving oil behind in pan.    Add cucumber and stir fry for two minutes, no more.    Add tamcon to spices in blender and with half the cucumber run on low speed  till everything looks coarsely ground and blended. Remove into a bowl, add  remaining cucumber pieces and mix well.
