Raspberry Bread Pudding #2
Fresh or frozen raspberries, Framboise (non-sweet, Eggs, Sugar, milk, (1-inch) piece vanilla bean, Loaf French bread; cut into, Unsalted butter, 
Butter each slice of bread on both sides. Put milk in heavy sauce pan.  Split vanilla lengthwise, and add to milk. Heat milk over medium heat until  nearly boiling. Remove vanilla bean and scrape seeds into milk. While milk  is heating, put eggs, sugar and Framboise in a mixing bowl and whisk until  smooth. After scraping vanilla seeds into milk, slowly whisk hot milk into  egg mixture, creating a smooth custard. Put four slices of bread in the  bottom of an ungreased, 3" deep baking dish with cover. Place 1/2 of the  raspberries on top of the bread, and then pour in 1/3 of the custard. Add a  second layer of bread. Top this with the rest of the raspberries, and  another 1/3 of the custard. Add the last layer of bread and top with the  remainder of the custard.     Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cover the custard dish and place in  oven, in another, larger dish, and add hot water to the outside dish until  it reaches half way up the sides of the inner dish. Bake for 45 minutes.  Remove the inner dish from the water, and return it to the oven for another  30 minutes. [NOTE: this is where it tends to get out-of-hand on me  :-)]. Remove cover [if it hasnt already been pushed off  :-)] and bake for a final 15 minutes.     Allow to cool (room temperature, or a little warm), cut and serve!
