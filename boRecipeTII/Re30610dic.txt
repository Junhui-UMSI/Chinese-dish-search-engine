Tail Gate "Annie" B.b.q. Leg of Lamb
Cumin, Salt, Boneless leg of lamb, Honey, Brown sugar, Shoyu, garlic, Chili powder, 
Open boneless leg of lamb up. If you see a thick portion, be sure to make  some cuts into it. Now you are ready to mix the marinade. In a bowl large  enough to hold the marinade, mix all the ingredients, then pour over the  boneless leg of lamb. Save about 3 tablespoons of shoyu to baste as you  cook on the B.B.Q. Marinate for about 4 - 6 hours. You can place the  boneless of lamb in a ziploc bag to marinate, or leave it in a bowl.    To BBQ: Place meat, skin side up, over hot coals. Cook for about 30 minutes  until well browned, then turn and cook skin side for 20 to 30 minutes.  Place a loose hood of aluminum foil over the meat while the second side  cooks.    To BROIL: Place meat and marinade in a shallow roasting pan (not on a rack)  meaty side up. Broil each side 6 to 8 inches from the heat for 20 to 30  minutes. Place sliced meat on serving platter. Bring remaining marinade and  pan drippings to a boil; pour over sliced meat.    Posted to Recipe Archive - 06 Oct 96    submitted by: musubi@hula.net    Date: Thu, 5 Sep 1996 21:04:28 -0500 (CDT)
