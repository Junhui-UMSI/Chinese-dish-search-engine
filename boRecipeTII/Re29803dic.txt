Fry until golden.  The thinner the food the better.    Personally I love hard veggies  (I.e. carrots, cauliflower, broccoli,  eggplant, zucchini and mushrooms) I also make fresh fish.  I use cod or  scrod usually. I also serve the tempura with sweet and sour sauce    NOTE: The recipe omitted the amount of cornstarch, only said "1/2", dont  know if it is cups or tablespoons! -- Glen.
