It was first posted last July by Fred Sauceman of East  Tennessee State University.  See my personal notes at the end....and do try  this one.    Cooks carrots in water until tender. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid  and discard the rest. Arrange the carrots in a shallow baking dish. Combine  the horseradish, onion, carrot liquid, salt, pepper, and mayonnaise. Pour  over the carrots. Combine the crumbs, butter, and paprika. Sprinkle over  the top. Bake 15-20 minutes in a preheated 375 degree oven.    Notes: I cut the carrots into thirds and then sliced the thirds lengthwise.  I didnt grate the onion, but did chop it very fine.  I didnt use bread  crumbs and paprika. I had some mesquite flavored potato chips...just  crumbs, really. I smashed them up and mixed them with butter, sprinkled  these over the top. My 9" corning ware pie plate was the perfect size. I  sprayed it with Pam first. Finally, I baked it for about 25 minutes at 350  degrees. I put it in the oven at the same time I put in Anitas "Peach  Crunch" and let them bake together.    These really are good. The flavor of the horseradish complements the  carrots. I dont know if they reheat well...we didnt have any  leftovers!!!!
