Cut steak lengthwise in 2-1/2-inch strips, trimming off fat as you go. Then  cut across the grain, in 1/8-inch thick strips. Put meat in bowl and att 1  teaspoon salt, cornstarch, and 2 teaspoons soy sauce. Wash asparagus  carefully, break off tough ends, and cut diagonally into pieces about  1/4-inch thick.  (If you cat on a SHARP DIAGONAL, the pieces will be abut  1-1/2 to 2" long.) Cut onions in half lengthwise, lay cut side down, and  slice crosswise into 1/4" slices. Smash garlic cloves with flat side of  knife or cleaver and remove sking. Heat a wide frying pan or wok over  highest heat, add 1/4 cup oil, it should bubble slightly from the heat. Add  garlic and cook just until pale brown. Remove and discard. Add meat, stir  frequently, and cook until almost browned. Remove to a bowl. Add 3  tablespoons more oil.  Add onion. Cook a minute or two stirring constantly.  Make a little hollow on top of the onion; add bean sauce. Cook until onion  starts to get translucent. Add asparagus and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon salt,  sugar and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Cover and cook, taking the top off  occasionally to stir well, just until asparagus is tender-crisp. Then, put  the meat on top. Cook, stirring,just long enough to get the meat reheated.  Seve at once. *TIPS: This is usually served over white rice. I always add  more grlic, usually with the onion, and leaving it in. You can experiment  with using flavored oil in part. Also, try a different Asian sauce if you  have it on hand.
