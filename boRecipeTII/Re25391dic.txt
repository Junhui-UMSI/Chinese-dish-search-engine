In a food processor, combine  the peas, onion, avocado, yogurt, lime juice, and hot pepper sauce. Process  until smooth. Set aside. To assemble the tortillas, combine the tomatoes  and cilantro in a bowl and stir to mix. In another bowl, toss the turkey  with the lime juice.    Heat a large nonstick saute pan over medium high heat. Place a tortilla in  the skillet and heat for about 1 minute, turning once, until softened.  Transfer to a work surface.

Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings. Cut the uneven  ends off the tortillas, wrap each one in a moist cloth or paper towel, and  refrigerate until ready to serve, or up to 2 hours. Cut each chilled  tortilla into 6 slices and arrange cut sides down on a platter.
