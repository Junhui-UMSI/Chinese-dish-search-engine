Pinto Beans and Rice
Cilantro, fresh, iceberg lettuce, pinto beans, Cooked long grain brown rice, Onion, Unflavored yogurt, tomato, Salsa, Red bell pepper, 
Stem, seed, and coarsely chop bell pepper.  Chop onion and cilantro leaves.  In a 2-3 quart microwave safe bowl mix rice, beans, 1/2 cup lettuce, 1/2  cup tomato, 1/2 of the bell pepper, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the  cilantro. Cover and cook on full power for 3 minutes. Stir, cover, and cook  until hot throughout, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Stir in remaining vegetables.  Spoon into individual bowls and garnish with salsa, yogurt, and salt to  taste. NOTE:  While the recipe says to spoon into bowls, my wife a nd I  love to eat this in flour tortillas, wrapping it up like a burrito!
