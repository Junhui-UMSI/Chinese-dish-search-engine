Flatman Family Corn Chowder - Crockpot
Bacon slices, diced, Onion, minced, Celery, minced, Water, Chicken boullion, Potatoes, minced, Milk*, Mocha mix or cream*, Cans cream style corn, Margarine, 
* Can use nondairy liquid creamer either in whole or partly cut with water  to make the total 4 cups liquid needed if necessary to avoid dairy  products.    Fry diced bacon until crisp, remove from pan.  Add minced onion and celery  to bacon grease and saute until limp.  Combine above in slow cooker pot  with water, boullion, potatoes, margarine and cream style corn. Cover and  cook on low 7 to 9 hours.  Add milk and cream, cook 1/2 hour more or until  heated through.    Notes: Can use chicken stock to replace water and bullion cubes.   Mocha mix makes this soup extremely rich tasting, and the Mocha mix does  not curdle with high heat like regular milk or cream.   Can also be made on the stovetop. Instead of placing in the slow cooker,  simmer on the stovetop until potatoes are tender. Add the milk, cream, or  liquid nondairy creamer and heat through. Serve immediately.
