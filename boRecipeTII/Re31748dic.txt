Sycamore Inn Cheese Pie
Graham Cracker Crust, Sour cream, Teasppon vanilla, Eggs, Sugar, Lemon juice(optional), Cream cheese, Lemon juice, Vanilla, Sugar, SOUR CREAM TOPPING, 
Heres a recipe that Ive been making for years and enjoying for years. I  found it in a magazine but I cant remember when or where or which one. I  do know that the pie is named after the Sycamore Inn which I dont know  anything about. But it is scrumptious.    In electric mixer whip cream cheese, eggs sugar, lemon juice and vanilla.  Spread into Graham Cracker Crust. Bake ate 350 degrees for 35 minutes.    Cool completely.    Spread sour cream topping over cooled baked filling.    Refrigerate to cool.    SOUR CREAM TOPPING: Beat together sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and sour  cream untill well blended.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 23 Mar 97 by "D.W." <malachi@EPIX.NET> on Mar 24,  1997
