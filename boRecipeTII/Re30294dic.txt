Sift  together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.    2. Beat butter and granulated sugar in large bowl of electric mixer on high  speed until light, 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after  each addition. Stop the mixer and add bananas, sour cream and vanilla. Mix  in on low speed. Fold in the dry ingredients and nuts with a rubber  spatula.    3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the  center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool completely on wire rack.    4. For caramel glaze, combine brown sugar and condensed milk in a small  saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture begins to  bubble. Reduce heat to low and add butter; cook and stir until melted.  Remove from the heat and stir in confectioners sugar and vanilla. Spread  over cooled cake.    5. For frosting, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Stir in sour  cream, maple and vanilla. Add enough confectioners sugar to make a smooth,  thick frosting. Carefully spread over caramel glaze.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
