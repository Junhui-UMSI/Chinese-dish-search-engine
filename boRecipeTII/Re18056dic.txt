Combine lentils, bread crumbs, egg whites, spinach, carrot, onion,  Cheddar cheese, salt and pepper in a bowl. Shape into 6 equal patties.  Place on a baking sheet. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.    2. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add burgers; cook 6 minutes,  turning over once halfway through cooking.    3. Meanwhile, if preparing the mayonnaise, mix together mayonnaise, mustard  and catsup in a small bowl.    4. Place burgers in buns and serve with mayonnaise if using.

NOTE:  Recipe calls for 8 buns, instructions say to make 6 patties; I might  not be a rocket scientist, but unless this only serves 6, two people are  going to get some real lean burgers!!!--Glen    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.
