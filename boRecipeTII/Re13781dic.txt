Recipe by: Robin Garr Cook wild rice and set aside. soak dried mushrooms in  2 cups water for 30 minutes. Drain and strain and save soaking water. Rinse  dried mushrooms and chop carsley. Cut portabello mushroom into bite size  pieces.Slice white mushrooms. Saute the mushrooms in the 1 tbs. butter and  then simmer in 1/2 cup reserved mushroom liquid. Save the other part of  mushroom liquid. Prepare butternut squash by peeling and seeding it and cut  up and reserve 3/4 cup diced; the remainder place in boiling water and cook  till tender. Drain and puree (should have 1 cup). Set aside. Mix remaining  mushroom liquid with broth and chicken stock and bring to a simmer.  Meanwhile saute the onions and garlic in the oil until soft but not brown.  Add the 3/4 cup of diced squash, scallions and stir. Add the arborio rice  to the pan and 2 ladles full of the broth. Continue this standard procedure  for risotto (adding broth little by little) to keep the rice creamy and  tender. This should tak about 25 minutes. When rice is almost done, stir in  the reserved squash puree and wild rice and reserved mushrooms. Stir to  blend. Remove from heat Stir in the cheese and salt and pepper to taste.  Although a bit time consuming this recipe has a combination of delicious  flavors.    Source: Robin Garr
