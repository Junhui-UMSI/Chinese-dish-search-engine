Those of you in the US may have heard this on Sundays NPR broadcast of  "Weekend All Things Considered"; so here for the world:    Note: Feel free to vary the quantities and ingredients of this recipe to  suit your taste. As Bati Restaurant makes it, the salad is slightly spicy,  but not too hot, with a definite, but not puckering, vinegar flavor.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees    Roast peppers on a baking sheet until they soften and blister enough so you  can peel them. Put them a brown paper bag or covered pot until theyre cool  enough to handle; then peel, remove any stems and seeds, and coarsely chop  so each chunk is about one to two inches square. Coarsely chop the tomatoes  and add to the peppers.    Coarsely chop the garlic, then grind with salt using a mortar and pestle or  any makeshift tool, until the mixture has turned to paste. Whisk into the  vinegar.    Whisk the olive oil into the vinegar-garlic mixture, toss with the peppers  and tomatoes ... and enjoy! Tarik likes to let the salad sit for a couple  hours before serving and then he spoons yoghurt sprinkled with raw minced  garlic on top. Goktan, on the other hand, likes to eat his roast pepper  salad the moment its done...dunking big chunks of crusty bread into the  vinaigrette as he does so....
