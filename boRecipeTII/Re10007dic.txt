Pyrohy Dough
Water (about), Salt, Egg yolks (the less egg, Egg -or-, Flour, 
Mix the flour with the salt in a deep bowl. Add the egg and enough water to  make a medium soft dough. Knead on a floured board until smooth. Too much  kneading will toughen the dough. Divide the dough into 2 parts. Cover and  let stand for 10 minutes.    Roll the dough quite thin on a floured board or counter. Cut rounds with a  large biscuit cutter or with the open end of a glass. Put the round or  square on the palm of a hand, place a spoonful of filling on it, fold dough  over to form a half-circle or triangle, and press the edges together. The  edges should be free of filling and well sealed in order to prevent opening  when boiling.    Boild in rapidly boiling salted water. Dont do too many at a time. Boil  for 3 to 4 minutes - they are ready when well puffed and floating on top.    Remove pyrohy and drain. Place in a deep dish. Sprinkle with melted butter  & onions if desired. Usually served with sour cream.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 09 Sep 96    From:    Raina Rudko-Buac <rainarb@OANET.COM>    Date:    Tue, 10 Sep 1996 07:33:21 -0600
