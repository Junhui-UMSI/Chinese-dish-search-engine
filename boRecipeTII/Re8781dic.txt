Hello everyone- I thought Id update you on at least two of the dishes  being prepared for the 2nd Annual Indiana Hot Luck and Fiery Foods  Festival. These are two of the dishes we are preparing, when its all over  well post reports!    Place above "A" ingredients into an iron skillet or dutch oven, gently cook  until onion is transparent and pork has cooked through. Drain off fat, if  any. To a dutch oven or large stockpot add "B".    Heat through and simmer until flavors have blended. With limes, be careful  how much salt you use- maybe add at the end of cooking. Garnish bowls of  this soup with chopped cilantro and a lime wedge. This recipe will serve  many people- at least a platoon!
