Pebre (Salsa De Cilantro)
Salt and black pepper, Tomatoes, Fresh Lemon Juice, Tabasco, garlic, Cilantro, Onions, vegetable oil, vinegar, 
Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and refrigerate. If  youre using onions instead of scallions, you may want to minimize the  "bite" of the raw onion. If so, sprinkle the minced onions with salt and  let them sit for a few minutes. Then press them gently in a sieve and rinse  them well in running water. This sauce will keep, refrigerated for three or  four days. Pebre is a perfect complement to any Chilean main dish.
