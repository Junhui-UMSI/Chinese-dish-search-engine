garlic, Ground cinnamon, Ground cardamom, Leg of lamb, Ground cloves, pistachios, Yoghurt, almonds, Turmeric, fresh ginger, Salt, Cayenne, Honey, Saffron threads, 
1.  Trim all fat from lamb, and, using a sharp knife, make slits all over  the leg.    2.  Combine the garlic/ginger paste and the salt with the cumin, turmeric,  cinnamon, cardamom, cayenne, cloves, and lemon juice to make a paste.  If  paste seems too thick, add more lemon juice. Spread the paste over the  meat, forcing into each slit.    3.  Soak the saffron threads in hot water for five minutes. 4. In a blender  or food processor put the yoghurt, the blanched nuts and the saffron  threads with their water, and puree.  Coat the lamb with the puree. Drizzle  honey over the meat.    5.  It is best to marinate the meat for two days in the refrigerator, or at  least overnight.  Cover loosely.    6.  Preheat oven to 450 F and roast lamb in a covered baking dish (use foil  wrap if necessary) for 1/2 hour.  Reduce heat to 325 F and cook at 25  minutes to the pound, about 1-1/2 hours, until meat is tender.
