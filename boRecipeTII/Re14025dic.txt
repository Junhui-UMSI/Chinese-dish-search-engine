White Chocolate Genoise
Unsalted butte; cut into, Sugar, Eggs; room temperature, Salt, Vainilla, Fine quality white chocolate, Cake flour (not self-rising), 
I found those recipies in th Key Gourmet CD-ROM. I havent tried them but I  hope they help.    Line the bottom of a greased 8 1/2 inch springsform pan with wax paper,  grease the paper and dust the pan with flour, knocking out the excess.    In a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt the white  chocolate with the butter, the vainilla and 3 tablespoons water, stirring  until the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let the  mixture cool. Into a bowl sift together the flour and the salt.    In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat the eggs with the sugar on high  speed for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is triple in volume and forms a  ribbon when the beaters are lifted. Fold the flour misture into the egg  mixture until the batter is just combined and fold in the white chocolate  mixture gently but thoroughly. Pour the batter into the pan, smoothing the  top, and bake the cake in the midle of a preheated 350 degree oven for 25  minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Transfer the cake to a rack,  run a sharp knife around the edge, and remove the side of the pan. Invert  the cake onto another rack and remove the wax paper. Reinvert the cake onto  the rack and let it cool completely.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #308 by "Wajnberg"  <wajnberg@trex.centroin.com.br> on Nov 25, 1997
