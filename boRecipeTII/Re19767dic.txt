Bob "Docpepr" Opersteny <RAO@CORHCC1.HCC.COM>    Aoli (Garlic Dressing)  (Base recipe by Frugal Gourmet: Jeff Smith)    Pedros Spanish Alioli below reminded me of the greek version of this  recipe; which is essentially garlic mayonaise/salad  dressing.  You can add  chiles or Sriracha for a dip/bread spread for fast  garlic bread, etc.    Blend/whip 1 egg at room temperature add garlic (pressed) into blender  blend and slowly add olive oil; till emulsion turns white/whipped-will look  like mayonaise stir in juice of 1/2 lemon or 1 lime (if youve got the  really big ones, taste after adding 1/2 amount) Use for potato salad, salad  dressing, cold chicken salad, garlic bread, Keep Refrigerated!    Note: no salt was added to base recipe, as this was to be a blood-pressure  friendly recipe; the natural aolin(?sp)  from the garlic, along with the  olive oil has been known to help blood pressure and heart stress.  You may  add salt, chiles, spices as desired to create effect as desired.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
