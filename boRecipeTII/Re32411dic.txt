Place squash in a suitable deep pot with cover. Add enough water to barely  cover squash. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and cook 5 min. Drain  water immediately and transfer squash to a 2 1/2 qt. shallow oven-proof  casserole. Allow to cool completely, then slice in half lengthwise. Hollow  out the halves as much as possible. When this is done, transfer the squash  to a large sheet of waxed paper or foil. Brush with the melted butter and  dust with Gruyere and set aside.    Cook spinach with as little water as possible, then drain all the water.  Transfer spinach to a mixing bowl.    In a skillet, heat butter and olive oil. Saute the onion until soft and  translucent but not browned. Add the almonds and cook until golden Add this  saute to the mixing bowl. Now add the next four ingredients up to and  including the Gruyere cheese. Mix well.    Grease the shallow 2 qt. casserole generously with butter.    With a tbsp., fill the hollowed squash with the stuffing, mounding it  neatly. As you do this, transfer the squash to the prepared oven proof  casserole. Combine the breadcrumbs and melted butter. Brush the stuffed  squash with mixture. Refrigerate, covered with plastic wrap for about 1 hr.  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for about 1 to 20 min or until golden.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with Sherry wine.    This will make 12 small squashed, or 6 larger ones. Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Lillian Mount <BirdsEtc@AOL.COM> on Aug 31, 1997
