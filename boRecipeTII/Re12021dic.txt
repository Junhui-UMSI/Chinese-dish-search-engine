Coarsely chop *two* of the bell peppers.  Combine these with the next eight  ingredients (chiles through wine) in a blender. Process until the mixture  is a smooth pur#e.    Cut the remaining bell pepper into 2" x 1/2" strips. Set aside.    Trim meat of al fat and slice 1/2" thick.  Cut slices into strips 2" long  by 1/4" wide.    Heat 1/2 cup butter or niter kebbeh in a heavy 10" to 12" skillet, until a  drop of water dances.  Brown meat in the skillet, a little at a time and  turning often, until the meatz is browned evenly without burning. Transfer  meat to a plate as it is browned.  When all meat is browned, pour remaining  fat into a measuring cup. Add enough addi- tional butter, or niter kebbeh,  to measure 1/2 cup.  Set aside.    Wash and dry the skillet.  Add the onions and cook them over low heat until  soft and dry, about five minutes. Stir the onions continuously to keep them  from burning.  Pour in the 1/2 cup cooking fat.  When it begins to sputter  add the green pepper strips. Cook two to three minutes, stirring  continuously, until the pepper strips are soft. Add the pureed green pepper  mixture.  While stirring, heat to a boil. Add beef strips and any liquid  accumulated on the plate to the skillet. Stir into the sauce to coat meat  evenly.  Reduce the heat, partially cover, and simmer until the meat is  cooked to taste.
