Poached Eggs in Tomato Sauce
Onion, Tomatoes, cheddar cheese, olive oil, Salt and pepper to taste, Italian bread, Eggs, Dried basil, 
Heat oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and  cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes,basil,salt and pepper and  bring to a boil. (Crush canned tomaties with a potato masher.) Increase  heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid  has evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes for fresh tomatoes (about 15 minutes for  canned tomatoes).    Press back of large spoon into tomato sauce in places, forming 8 wells.  Carefully break 1 egg into each well. Season eggs with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer over low heat until eggs are poached to desired doneness,  6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat.    Sprinkle cheese over eggs. Cover skillet and let stand until cheese is  melted, about 1 minute. Gently spoon sauce and eggs over toast. Serve  immediately.    TIP:  Make sauce ahead and keep refrigerated. Or substitute thick  ready-made tomato sauce for homemade sauce.
