Butter, Vanilla, Pureed pumpkin, Crumb crust, Cream cheese, Eggs, All-purpose flour, Heavy cream, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Fructose (fruit sugar), Salt, 
*Note: The Unicorn uses a graham cracker crust for its cheesecake. A  standard recipe would call for 3 cups finely ground crumbs combined with 12  tablespoons melted butter or margarine. Press into bottom and up the sides  of an ungreased 10-inch springform pan.    To make the filling: Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer on medium  speed until fluffy.  Stir together fructose, flour and salt and blend  gradually into cream cheese. Add vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and butter,  keeping mixture smooth.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating after each addition.  Beat in pumpkin and heavy cream and turn into prepared crust. Bake 30  minutes at 350 degrees F, or until set. Cool completely on a rack.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
