Texas Barbecue Show Barbecue Brisket
Recipe beer mop sauce, Beef brisket (8 to 12), Mansion barbecue spice mix, 
Have your butcher trim the brisket with a thick layer of fat on one side,  its called a packer-trimmed brisket.    The day before you want to serve the dish, pat the Mansion Barbecue Spice  Mix liberally all over the brisket. Place the meat in a plastic trash bag  and refrigerate it, preferably overnight.    The next morning, remove the brisket from the refrigerator. Either pre-heat  the oven or the barbecue pit to 210 degrees F. Place the brisket on a rack  in a roasting pan or directly into the pit on the opposite side of the  firebox making sure the trim side is up., to ensure basting juices.  Maintain the temperature of the oven or barbecue pit between 180 and 220  degrees F until the brisket is well done, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound.  Baste with the beer mop sauce every hour or so. When the meat is done  remove it from the oven/barbecue pit and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then  cut the fatty top section away from the leaner bottom portion. Trim the  excess fat from both pieces and slice against the grain.    Serve with barbecue sauce on the side.
