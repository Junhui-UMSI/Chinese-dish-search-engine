Zuchini Bread
Grated squash, Flour, Salt, Sugar, Baking soda, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Vegetable oil, Cinnamon, Eggs, 
Combine ingredients in Large bowl, mix well.  Pour into greased and floured  loaf pans.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour.  Serve hot or cold with butter, cream  cheese, or just plain.  Mmmmm. Variations: Applesauce or pumpkin bread -  use same as zuchini, but add 3 cups water and 4 tsp ginger. Another thing I  did often, was bake the batter in cupcake/muffin tins. Then when the kids  wanted a snack, they could just take "one" without the worry or mess of  slicing from the loaf.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on May 26, 98
