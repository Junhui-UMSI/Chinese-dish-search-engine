Cube bread and toss in a large bowl with raisins and caraway seeds. Stale  bread may be used instead of fresh. Toss apples in a bolw with bread cubes.    Combine apple and sunflower butter (or tahini), 1 cup water, miso, amazake  or soy milk, then pour liquid mixture over apples and bread. Stir to coat.  Spoon mixture into a lightly oiled 2-quart casserole dish or two 9-inch pie  plates or cake pans. Cover with lid (oven-proof).    Allow mixture to sit for 2 to 4 hours before baking so bread will soak up  flavors. Bake covered at 350F for 1 hour or until slightly firm and mixture  pulls away from sides slightly. Then remove from oven and spoon into  individual dessert cups. An ice cream scooper works well. Allow to cool  slightly and then serve.
