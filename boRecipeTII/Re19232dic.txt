Source: my own kitchen    Arrange broccoli pieces in bottom of quiche pan.    Combine and mix together the eggs, sour cream, cottage cheese, Bisquick,  oil or margarine, salt and pepper and pour mixture over broccoli.    Place sliced tomatoes over the top of mixture and sprinkle with parmasan  cheese.    Bake in 350? oven for approximately 30 minutes.    The wonderful part of this recipe is that you can use any kind of sour  cream and/or cottage cheese - from full fat to low fat to NO FAT and the  quiche is the same - DELICIOUS!!!    I have also added sliced sauteed mushrooms to the cheese mixture before  pouring over broccoli.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by pikboca@webtv.net (Phyllis Kinsler) on May  25, 1998
