Pesach Candy
Ginger; (Perhaps 1/4 oz), Water, Glass; (or more) chopped, Honey-use a good; tasty, Glasses Matzo Farfel; ( I, 
Boil honey, add farfel gradually, ginger to taste, then nuts (save some see  below). Brown on a big light (watch it like a hawk so it doesnt burn.) Add  a little water. Brown. (It takes a while, not instant) Put on a wet board  spread and cover with nuts and ginger. Cut into diamond shapes and place on  a dish. (You can layer this on the dish by sprinkling more nuts on top and  covering with wax paper, putting nuts on the wax paper, etc. I dont think  plastic wrap would do it. Anyway its harder to pick off the sticky candy)    Notes: Most of this is in my mothers words. The parentheses are my  additions. The longer you cook this the harder it gets and the more  fillings it is capable of pulling of your teeth out as you eat it, but the  better it holds the diamond shape. I usually go for it fairly soft and  shapeless, as I have bad teeth . I make this for the extended family and my  100 year old Aunt Jeanette, always most particular, complains of the poor  quality of the shapes, but the good taste. This is a confection no one is  neutral about, either they love it or cant stand it. Timings are imprecise  as with tayglach, which this resembles, as honeys vary in water content  etc.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #312 by "W. Baker" <wbaker@panix.com> on  Nov 29, 1997
