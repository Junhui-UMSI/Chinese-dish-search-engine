BBQ Pork: Preheat the oven to 325F. In a medium bowl, whisk together the  molasses, vinegar, tomato paste, garlic, cumin, cayenne, paprika,  coriander, salt and pepper. Place the pork cubes and bay leaves in a large,  shallow noncorrodible baking dish. Add the molasses mixture and stir well  to coat. Cover with foil and bake until pork is very tender, about 1 1/2  hours.    Remove the meat from the sauce and shred with a knife. Return the shredded  meat to the baking dish and mix with the sauce.    Slice the buns in half. Spoon the pork onto the bottom halves of the buns  and mound 1/2 cup or more of the vegetable slaw on top.  Cover with the bun tops and serve the remaining vegetable slaw on the side.  Five-Vegetable Slaw: In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, red and  green bell peppers, cucumber and scallions. Mix in the mayonnaise, vinegar,  salt and black pepper. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days before  serving.    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Mar 19, 1998
