To prepare the guavas for stuffing, cut a thin slice from the top of the  guava.  With a melon ball scoop or small spoon, remove the seeds and set  the guavas aside.    Heat the oil in a skillet.  Add mushrooms, onion, green olives, herbs, salt  and pepper; saute until vegetables are soft. Remove the mixture from the  flame; cool.  Stuff the guavas, filling them to the top.    Place stuffed guavas in a baking dish just large enough to hold them and  sprinkle sesame seeds over the guava tops. Bake at 325 F. for 1 hour, or  until the fruit is tender. Serve hot.
