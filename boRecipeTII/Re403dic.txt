Lemon Crackers
Cents worth baking ammonia, Sweet milk, Sugar, Lard, Eggs, Cents worth lemon oil flour, 
Mrs.Walter I. Kangas    "Baking ammonia" was a type of baking powder that can be replaced with a  modern double-acting baking powder. Not knowing the precise date of the  recipe, it is difficult to know how much baking ammonia or lemon oil could  have been purchased for 5 cents; probably about 1 tsp. of baking powder and  1/2 tsp. of lemon extract would be appropriate.    Soak the baking ammonia in the milk overnight. The next day, cream the  sugar and lard together, then add the beaten eggs, lemon oil, and  milk-ammonia mixture; beat until smooth. Mix in enough flour to make the  dough stiff enough to roll. Roll the dough out into a sheet about 1/4 inch  thick. Cut it into pieces, prick with a fork, and bake until crisp and just  starting to change color in a hot oven (about 400?); this should take about  5 to 8 minutes.
