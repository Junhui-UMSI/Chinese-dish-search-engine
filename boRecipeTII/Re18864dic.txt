Andreas White Chocolate Mousse
Whipping cream, Vanilla, Brandy, Hot water, White chocolate, Eggs, Sugar, 
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over medium-low heat. Its a good  idea  to stand over the chocolate while its melting and stir until it has melted  completely; take it off the heat immediately.    Whip the cream and set aside.    Pour the brandy and hot water slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks,  whisking briskly as you go until completely mixed. Whisk in the melted  chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is completely combined;  this  will help cool the chocolate.    Whip the egg whites and the sugar, adding the vanilla as you beat, until  peaking but not dry. Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture  carefully with a wooden spoon. Fold in the whipped cream. This is the most  critical part of the recipe.  The key to a great chocolate mousse is  incorporating cooled chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate must be  cool  to the touch or the cream will separate. Lightly blend the two mixtures  until  uniform.    The mousse is actually at its best texture as soon as mixed.
