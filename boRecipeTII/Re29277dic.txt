Baked Stuffed Haddock
Onion, Dry sherry, Black pepper, Haddock fillets, Bread crumbs, Salt, Unsalted butter, Celery, Dried thyme, Stewed tomatoes, 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease a 9- by 9-inch baking  dish.   Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter and saute the onion and celery with the  thyme until soft, about 8 minutes.  Add the sherry and cook for 2 minutes  longer.  Add the bread crumbs, remove from heat, and mix well.  Season with  salt and pepper, to taste.   Place half of the fillets in the baking dish.  Cover with half of the  stuffing.  Repeat with the rest of the fish and the stuffing.  Top with the  tomatoes, making sure that they are broken into small chunks.  Pour the  juice from the can around the sides of the baking dish. Drizzle the  remaining butter over the top.   Bake the haddock for 35 to 40 minutes or until the fish easily flakes when  tested with a fork.  Serve at once.  This recipe serves 4 to 6.
