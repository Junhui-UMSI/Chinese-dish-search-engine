Melt caramels in a  double boiler with butter and condensed milk till the consistency of honey  (or close).    Pour 2/3 of the cake batter into a greased and floured 9x13 pan (with high  sides). Top with caramel mixture. Pour the rest of the cake batter over the  caramel mixture and top with chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. Bake in  350 degree (F) oven for 30-35 minutes. Im guessing at the temperature and  time, so you may need to keep a close eye on this while baking to avoid  overcooking.    Sorry about all the guesstimates, but it has been a long time since I have  made this and I cant find the recipe. Sorry.    This is very rich and guaranteed to harden arteries on contact, so enjoy!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
