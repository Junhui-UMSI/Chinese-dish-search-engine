Whilst not particularly Indian, I dont think, it uses many of the  same spices and I felt it turned out very moreish.    Use banana peppers (paprika), or really any capsicum or mild pepper would  do. The shape of the banana peppers is best to enable them to be covered in  the sauce.    Note:  I like things pretty spicy and doubled the above herbs - dill,  tumeric, cummin, garam masala - and used 6 hot chillies.    1. Cut peppers down the side and remove seeds and membranes.    2. Cook and mash potatoes.    3. Cook onion in a little water.    4. Mix into potato half of the onion, dill, half of the chillies, salt and  pepper to taste. Add more of what you like to get a tasty mix.    5. stuff the mix in the peppers.    6. Mix in the remaining onion the chillies, tumeric, cummin, garum masala  tomatoes, and cook a bit on the stove to mix flavours.    7. Put peppers in a shallow dish or (as I did) a loaf pan. Put cut side up.    8. Cover with sauce and foil over the top.    9. Bake in moderate oven 3/4 hour or until peppers are tender. Or you can  microwave if short of time.

If you make extra stuffing mix that you dont use - keep it and add  lentils, egg substitite and cover in breadcrumbs to make lovely patties.    fatfree digest V96 #223    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
