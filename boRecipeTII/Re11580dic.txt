Raspberry Meringue Shells
Chambord or Framboise, Frozen vanilla yogurt, Fresh raspberries, Vanilla, Sugar, Salt, Cream of tartar, Whipping cream, whipped, OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS, Egg whites, 
Servings:    To egg whites (at room temperature) add vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt.  Beat til frothy.  Gradually add sugar, a small amount at a time, beating  until very stiff peaks form and sugar is completely dissolved.    Cover a cookie sheet with plain ungreased paper (I use brown paper grocery  bags).  Spoon meringue onto paper, dividing into 6 equal mounds. Shape with  the back of a spoon to form bird nest shapes. Bake at 275 degrees F for one  hour.  Turn off oven and let dry with the door closed for at least another  1 1/2 hours.  If meringues will not be used immediately, place into an  airtight container to store, or they can be left in an oven which has a  pilot light overnight.    Place meringues on serving plates.  Place a large scoop of vanilla frozen  yogurt (or vanilla ice cream) into each meringue, smother with fresh  raspberries, drizzle with Chambord, Framboise, or other raspberry liquor  (optional), and top with whipped cream (or whipped topping).
