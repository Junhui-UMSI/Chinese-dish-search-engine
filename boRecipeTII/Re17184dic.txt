Vlf Basic Birchermuesli
Finely chopped dried organic, Or less date, or brown,, Quick cooking rolled oats, Dried organic currants or, Wheat germ, 
Mix thoroughly; stores well up to a month. Variations: substitute wheat,  rice, barley, rye, soy, or millet flakes for oats. Or, replace fruit with  dehydrated dates, apples, peaches, or cherries.    Apple muesli is my favorite variation; for one serving:    Soak 1 T rolled oats in 3 T water for 12 hrs (quick cooking oats, soaked  1/2 hr, can be substituted). In separate bowl, combine 1 T lemon juice with  3 T of the best organic yogurt available and sweeten with 1 T honey. Stir  until mix is smooth and add pre-soaked oats. Next grate 1 unpeeled apple  into bowl. Finally, sprinkle basic mix on top. Posted to fatfree digest V97  #052 by nance@utk.edu on Apr 9, 1997
