Roast the peppers either over a gas burner or under the broiler until  blistered all over. Place in a bag for 10 minutes. Remove stems and seeds,  and chop.    Saute the onions and garlic until soft, but not brown. Add the tomato and  heat for several minutes until the mixture has thickened.    Add the zucchini and 1 tbsp water, stir, and cover. Cook until the squash  is tender (about 7 minutes). Add the chopped chiles and corn, and cook over  medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Add the sat and epazote or cilantro, if using.  Heat until most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the cheese, cover,  and remove from heat. Wait for 3 minutes, then serve.    >From: Ellen C.
