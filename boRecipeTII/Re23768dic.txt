Artillery Punch #2
red wine, Orange juice, black tea, Rye whiskey, Dry gin, Brandy, benedictine, Lemon juice, Jamaica rum, 
Heres a drink taken from The Bartenders Guide by Patrick Gavin Duffy  that I found, er, interesting. More can be found in the Guide. Good Luck     Combine all ingredients in a large punch bowl with a block of ice. If  found too dry, Sugar Syrup may be added. Decorate with twists of Lemon  Peel. This makes a lot.
