Red and Black Beans
Vegetable broth, Red beans, Onion, Red pepper flakes, Black pepper, Red bell pepper, Corn, Garlic, Tomatoes, Ground cumin, Corn tortillas, Black beans, Green bell pepper, Salt, 
Preheat oven at 350.  In a large saucepan, combine the soaked beans and  vegetable stock.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for  45 minutes or until the beans are tender.  Add the tomatoes, onion, corn,  green pepper, red pepper, garlic, cumin and chili flakes.  Simmer for 15  minutes.  Season to taste with pepper and salt.  Steam the corn tortillas  (the microwave works fine for this) until soft enough to roll without  breaking.  Using a slotted spoon, fill each tortilla with a generous 1/2  cup of beans.  Roll and place seam side down, in a nonstick baking dish.  Pour the beans and their sauce over the stuffed tortillas and bake for 15  minutes, or until bubbling hot.
