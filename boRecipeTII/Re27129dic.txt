Dry bread crumbs, Oregano, Unpeeled zucchini, Crushed rosemary, Italian sausage (optional), Imported romano cheese;, Clove gatlic; crushed, Potatoes, Pepperoni (optional), Diced green peppers, Basil, salt and pepper, Canned tomato sauce, Parsley flakes, 
In bowl, combine bread ctumbs, cheese and seasonings. Thinly slice enough  unpeeled zucchini and peeled potatoes to fill 1 1/2 qt casserole(best to  use a larger one and not make it as thick, so it cooks through better),  using about 3 or 4xs as much zucchini as potato. Put a layer of potatoe on  bottom of casserole, then layer of zucchini; salt and pepper to taste.  Cover generously with crumb mixture, put the green peppers in next, then  pour about 1/3 of tomatoe sauce over it. Repeat potatoes, zucchini, crumbs;  use remainder of tomatoe sauce. If desired, you may dice pepperoni and put  some in the middle of casserole, the put the rest on top after it has been  in the oven about 45 min. Or, other meat such as Italian sausage (we like  the hot variety best) may be used. Bake in 350F oven about 1 1/2 hours, or  until potatoes and zucchini are fork tender. Seasonings may be varied  according to personal preference as well. busted by sooz  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 174 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Oct 28, 1997
