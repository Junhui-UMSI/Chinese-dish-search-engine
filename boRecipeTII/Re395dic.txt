Lemon Cloud
(3 oz) lemon Jello, Boiling water, (8 oz) of cream cheese;, (15 oz) evaporated milk, Granulated sugar, Vanilla, 
Youll never know this is a sugar-less dessert! It is a scrumptious cross  between lemon mousse and lemon cheesecake. Follow the diabetic version at  the bottom of the recipe. Lynn BUSY COOKS - http://busycooks.miningco.com    In a small bowl, dissolve lemon jello in boiling water. Place in  refrigerator until it starts to thicken. Place the can of evaporated milk  in the freezer, along with the large mixing bowl, to chill. When jello  begins to thicken (about the consistency of egg whites) and milk is  chilled, proceed with recipe.    In the small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until well  blended. Add the thickened Jello and blend until well mixed, scraping down  the sides often.    In the chilled large mixing bowl, mix the well chilled evaporated milk and  vanilla and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in the Jello/cream cheese  mixture and beat at low speed until well blended, scraping the sides of the  bowl often. Since all the ingredients are white, it is hard to tell if the  Jello is well distributed, so blend thoroughly.    Divide the mixture among 6 footed dessert dishes and chill for several  hours. May also be poured into a pie crust.    Low-fat variation: Use fat-free evaporated milk and light cream cheese (in  the 8 oz package, NOT the fat-free version in the tub).    Diabetic variation: Use sugar-free Jello and substitute 12 packets of Equal  for the sugar.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Lynn Nelson <lynnn@erols.com> on Sep 27,  1998,
