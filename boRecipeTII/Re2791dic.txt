Peanut Butter Cookies
Egg, Whole-wheat flour (or less), Brown sugar, Vegetable oil, Peanut butter, Vanilla extract, Baking soda, 
My note:  tested using 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour.  YUM!  These are  large cookies, 2 tsp sugar per cookie.    Preheat oven to 350 F.    Cream together the peanut butter and vegetable oil in a bowl.  Add  brown sugar, vanilla, and egg.  Beat well.    Add flour (reserve 1/4 - 1/2 cup) and baking soda.  Blend thoroughly.  Add enough extra flour so that you can shape dough into balls and  place on an ungreased baking sheet.  Can be made as 36 medium (my  choice) or 48 small cookies.    Flatten with a fork, bake about 10 - 15 minutes or until lightly  browned.    1/24 recipe = 96 calories, 1 starch/bread + 1 fat exchange 2 grams  protein, 13 grams carbohydrate, 4 grams fat, 89 mg sodium    adapted from Quick & Easy Diabetic Menus by Betty Wedman, 1993 Shared  and tested by Elizabeth Rodier Feb 94    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/diabetic.zip
