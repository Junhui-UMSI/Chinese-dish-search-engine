* Follow instructions on your tempeh to make it ready to eat; the tempeh I  make is already pre-cooked and it is made with soybeans and barley.    Directions: Add all ingredients except the last two to a food processor and  process until smooth. Then add the last two, mix by hand and then form into  ball. Chill for at least two hours.    Serve with veggies or crackers.    Comments and/or improvements are welcome. Gunter Pfaff, 73740,2515
