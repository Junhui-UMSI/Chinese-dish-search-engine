Hi, I dont know about lemon poppyseed cake but I have a recipe for lemon  poppyseed muffins. Its in the archive already, I think. (Recipe was based  on a scone recipe from Christel Reeve    Mix "A" in one bowl. Mix "B" in a separate bowl.    Mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Try to use as few strokes  as possible. Use a scoop or tablespoon to put batter into prepared muffin  tins. (I made mini-muffins). Use Pam or nonstick muffin pans. Bake in  preheated 350F oven until passes the toothpick test. Im not really sure  about the cooking time for larger muffins because I made mini ones this  weekend so you probably need to see for yourself.    mini-muffins: about 9 minutes or until golden brown regular or giant  muffins: probably about 15 minutes.
