I found this recipe in todays Orange County Register. It seems to go along  with the other pumpkin recipes, just a little different. Hope its good as  I havent had time to try it either. Barb    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut top from pumpkin and remove seeds and  strings. Prick cavity with fork and sprinkle with 1 tsp of the salt. Heat  pot or large skillet.    2. Add oil to pot or skillet. When hot, add garlic and onion and saute  until onion is transparent. Add beef and continue sauteeing until browned.  Remove from heat and add remaining ingredients.    3. Stuff pumpkin with mixture. Place 1/2 inch water in bottom of a shallow  baking pan large enough to hold the pumpkin.    4. Put pumpkin in the pan and bake 1-1 1/2 hours. Cut pumpkin into wedges  (or if small pumpkins used, into halves) and serve, giving each person both  pumpkin and stuffing.
