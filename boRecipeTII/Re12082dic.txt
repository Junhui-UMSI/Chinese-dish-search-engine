submitted by: sgjg6566@pipeline.com (Julie, Michigan, USA)  Hi everyone! Now that the fresh herbs are really coming up I like to serve  this recipe for a simple delicious meal! Its from the New York Times  Cookbook and one of my favorites!    Combine the parsley, tarragon, chives and chervil in a small bowl. Bring 2  quarts of water to a boil in a large pot and add salt. Add the ziti and  cook about 12 minutes; drain. Return the ziti to the pot and add the butter  and oil. Toss briefly and add the herb mixture (and the tomato if you  want). Toss and serve immediately with the grated cheese. Enjoy!!
