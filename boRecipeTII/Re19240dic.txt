"Augment your Far East platter with teriyaki meatballs wrapped in thin  vegetable ribbons." Using a sharp vegetable peeler, slice zucchini and  squash lengthwise into wide flat ribbons; set aside. Remove top and seeds  from red pepper, cut into 3/4" to 1" wide strips; trim flesh to make strips  about 1/8" thick. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl combine turkey, bread  crumbs, onion, garlic, basil, salt and ground red pepper. Shape into 1"  balls and arrange in a shallow baking pan. Brush meatballs with half of the  hoisin sauce. Bake at 350F 20 minutes or until meat is no longer pink. Cool  15 minutes. In a saucepan cook zucchini, squash and red pepper, uncovered,  in boiling water 2 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water. Drain well. Wrap  each meatball with a ribbon of vegetable; secure with toothpicks. Place  wrapped meatballs on a clean ungreased baking sheet; brush with remaining  hoisin sauce. Return to 350F oven; bake 10 minutes. Makes 40 meatballs.  Better Homes and Gardens, "Good things in small packages", January 1998.    Recipe by: Better Homes and Gardens, January 1998, Page 130.
