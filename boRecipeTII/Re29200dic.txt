In a large skillet, heat oil over  medium-high heat. Add garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.  Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in tomatoes, oregano, and red pepper  flakes. Cover; simmer until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.    3 In a medium bowl, combine crabmeat, ricotta, parsley, and black pepper.  Mix well.    4 Spoon crabmeat mixture evenly into each shell. Place in a large baking  dish. Pour sauce over shells. Bake until heated through, about 15 minutes.  Divide shells among individual serving plates. Serve immediately.
