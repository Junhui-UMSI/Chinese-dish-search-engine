Crumbled Feta cheese, Cucumber; peeled and sliced, salt and pepper, Ripe tomatoes, A few Greek Salonika, Olive oil; (or less or, A few Calamata olives;, Onion or 1 bunch of, Fresh Lemon Juice, Oregano; (dried), use more, 
Heres a lovely, refreshing, and easy salad, that I adapted from one in  Yianilos book.    Slice tomatoes and arrange on a plate with sliced cucumbers and slivers of  onion. Scatter olives and peppers over these. Sprinkle olive oil and lemon  juice over the veggies and top with salt and pepper, Feta and finally,  oregano. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving at room temperature --  best when not chilled. Great for a pot luck and very colorful.
