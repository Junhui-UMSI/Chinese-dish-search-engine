Pat chicken pieces dry so seasoning coats well; set aside. Combine  seasoning mix ingredients; sprinkle generously over both sides of the  chicken. Reserve 1 tablespoon mix for sauce and store leftovers in a  covered container. Grill chicken, skin side down, uncovered, over medium  coals for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 20 to 30 minutes more or until chicken is  tender and no longer pink. Meanwhile, combine all sauce ingredients in a  small bowl. During the last 10 minutes of grilling, brush chicken often  with sauce.    Shared by Dia food@iname.com Taste of Home Magazine is the best!!    NOTES : "We dont fry foods much anymore and prefer to barbecue, so I  adapted my mothers recipe for barbecue sauce to suit our tastes," declares  Linda Scott of Hahira, Georgia. "Every summer, we have a  neighborhood  cookout. I take this chicken and watch it disappear!"
