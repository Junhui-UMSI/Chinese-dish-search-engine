Although it takes about 45 min  to prepare, there is a long period where theres nothing to do, so I think  its suitable for a work night. Shulman thinks it serves 4-6 people. We  think 3 (generously) or 4 (or two for dinner and one for lunch.).    Recipe By: Martha Rose Shulmans Main-Dish Salads    Bring the water to a boil and add the rice.  Add salt to taste, bring back  to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 40 minutes, until the  rice is tender. Drain and toss with the broccoli, nuts, and parsley.    [Meanwhile, steam broccoli and chop nuts.]    Mix together the lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, and yogurt.  Whisk in the  walnut oil and add salt and pepper.  Toss with the rice mixture, correct  the seasonings, and serve; or refrigerate until shortly before serving.    Note: If the salad is to be refrigerated for a long time, add the broccoli  and parsley shortly before serving to retain their bright color.    [Shulman says this serves 4-6. We think 3-4.]    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
