Over moderate heat, saute the turkey pieces, turning occasionally,  until well browned. Remove to a warm place.    Saute the minced shallot and garlic in the skillet juices 3-4 minutes,  stirring frequently until soft. Stir in the flour, a little at a time, to  make a smooth paste and cook 1 minute, stirring; then gradually stir in a  little of the chicken stock, continuing until the stock is used up and the  sauce is smooth and quite thick.    Return the turkey pieces to the pan, season with a little salt and fresh  pepper to taste, spoon the sauce over the turkey, and sprinkle tarragon on  top. Cover and simmer over very low heat about 5 minutes more. Stir in the  yogurt and heat, but do not boil.    Spoon the sauce over the fillets and serve.
