Whipped Cream Graham Cake
Honey or sugar, (2 cups) heavy cream, Squares (16 rectangles) of, Sprinkles, 
Beat cream with sweetener until stiff. Spread whipped cream heavily on one  square and place it on a platter. Spread cream heavily on a second square  and place it on top of the first. Continue until there is a stack of 4  squares. Press down gently on the top square so the cream squeezes out of  the sides. Spread the excess along the sides. Repeat the procedure until  there are eight stacks. Slide them together till sides touch to form a  rectangular cake of 2 squares by 4 squares. Use extra whipped cream to  smooth over all the tops. Refrigerate. Allowing it to chill several hours  before serving enables the crackers to soften. A dash of sprinkles over the  top adds a party flavor with adding much additional sugar.    Hint: Use a pressurized can of whipped cream if you dont have the time or  inclination to whip the cream.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/kids.zip
