Recipe by: CD Heat the oil in a dutch oven and saute the onions until  golden.  Add the garlic and saute for another 2 - 3 minutes. Add the turkey  and saute until the meat loses its color, stirring to break the meat apart.  Sprinkle the m harian onto the meat and stir to incorporate, cooking for an  additional 2 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients(except beans), the  reserved tomato juice and 2 cups of chicken stock. Bring to a boil over  high heat, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours,  stirring occasionally, adding the remaining chicken stock if necessary. Add  the beans and continu cooking for 10 to 15 minutes to heat thoroughly.  Serve with corn bread, tortillas, diced onions, grated cheese, sour cream,  chopped fresh coriander or anything else you like with your chili.    NOTE:  Try and get the ingredients listed.  If you use regular chili powder  careful about what it has in it. Most purchased chili powders are a mixture  chili powder, cumin, salt, and other spices.  Again, I strongly suggest usi  the ingredients listed as the taste is well worth the effort.  This chili h  a nice "earthy" taste with a hint of smokiness imparted by the chipotle  chilies in adobe sauce.    Beef or pork can be substituted for the turkey.
