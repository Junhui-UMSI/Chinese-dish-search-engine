Baked Sour Cream Doughnuts
DOUGHNUTS, All-purpose flour, GLAZE, Butter, Warm water, Eggs, Baking soda, Nonfat sour cream, Pure maple syrup, Cinnamon, BRUSHON TOPPING, Baking Powder, Salt, Nutmeg, Butter, Sugar, 
In a large mixing bowl, combine 3-1/2 c. flour with baking powder, baking  soda, salt, and spices; whisk to blend. Set aside.    Combine the eggs and sugar in large bowl of food processor. Process until  pale yellow and slightly thickened. Add 1/4 c. of melted butter and sour  cream; blend well. Add dry ingredients; beat until a moist, stiff dough is  formed.    Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently, working in  additional flour to prevent sticking. Dough should be soft and smooth.  Cover; let rest for 30 minutes.    Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (400 if using convection).  Generously grease 2 baking sheets (I use nonstick baking sheets without  additional grease).    Roll the dough to a 1/2" thickness and cut out with 2-1/2" doughnut cutter.  Transfer to the prepared baking sheets, ensuring that you leave at least 1"  between doughnuts. Brush with the remaining 1/4 c. melted butter.    Bake 12-15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer to a cooling rack.    When doughnuts are completely cooled, combine the confectioners sugar,  water, and maple syrup in a small bowl. Blend until smooth, then spread  over the surface of each doughnut.    Serve immediately.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest by Musique68 <Musique68@aol.com> on Apr 14,  1998
