Spread mixture evenly into tins then sprinkle  ground hazlenuts evenly over both meringues ( you can swirl them through  with a small spatula if you like , I dont but thats just me) . Bake in a  moderate oven 35 to 40 minutes or until the meringue is crisp to touch;  release sides  and cool on base of pan.    Melt chocolate over a double boiler  allow to slightly cool then spread  evenly over the two meringue bases. When set place one base on serving  plate and cover with whipped cream arrange strawberries to cover.Place  second base, chocolate side down , on top of the strawberries cover the  whole thing with more whipped cream and decorate with whatever strawberries  you have left, it helps to halve them , and if you want really" speco"  presentation brush them with sieved strawberry jam for a nice glaze.
