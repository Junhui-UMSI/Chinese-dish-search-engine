[I think this recipe assumes raw crabmeat to start; refer to instructions  below about boiling crab meat and alter technique if using pre-cooked crab  meat, perhaps by just boiling some ginger and cloves in small amount of  water and adding a bit to flavor crab.  -- cmt]    Put crab meat in boiling salted water along with ginger piece and cloves.  Cook about 15 minutes, until meat is tender enough to flake with a fork.  Drain, flake and set aside.    In a heavy pot, heat oil to a moderate temperature and add other  ingredients in the following sequence, stirring for a minute or so between  each: onions, ground ginger, tomatoes, tomato paste, green pepper, paprika,  cayenne, and dried shrimp.  Reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes,  stirring constantly, until vegetables are cooked.  Add crab meat and stir  another couple of minutes to heat it through.  Then spoon the mixture into  clean crab shells or ramekins (small individual baking dishes).    Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of each crab and toast under an oven broiler,  being careful not to let the crumbs scorch.  Garnish with egg and parsley.
