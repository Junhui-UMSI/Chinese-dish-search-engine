Beef and Rice "Olives"
Oregano, Egg, Lean ground beef, Cooked converted rice, Salt, Pepper, 
SERVES 8-10      This dish comes from a cookbook that is about 200 years old. I cannot  quite figure out the background of the name but we have seen the dish many  times since those early days. It is obviously a way of stretching meat  using rice. I have added some seasoning and the dish is baked, so it is  easy to prepare.      Mix all together and form into 1-inch balls. Place on a baking sheet and  bake for about 20 minutes at 375?, or until they are done to your taste.      If you make these small enough, they are terrific as party snacks. Larger  sizes fit the dinner table well, along with a green salad, rolls, and  perhaps some Cabbage and Salt Pork (see recipe).    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
