Cut the core out of the cabbage. Fill a large pot half-full with water and  bring to a boil. Put the cabbage with the core-side down into the water.  Boil for a few minutes, then turn head around so core-side is up. Start to  carefully remove the outer leaves with a pair of tongs. Try to leave the  leaves as whole and undamaged as possible. The stem of the leaves should be  soft enough to roll. Remove about 16-18 leaves and set aside on a plate.  Leave the rest of the cabbage simmering for about 20 minutes to get the  stock for the sauce.    Filling: Soak the bread in the milk. Combine soy meat, rice, egg, soaked  bread, onion, salt and pepper in a blender and mix well to get a thick  paste. Spread one cabbage leaf out on the table in front of you with the  stem end towards you. Take 1-2 tablespoons of the filling and place it on  the stem end. Carefully roll up the cabbage leaf folding in the sides as  well. Put seam facing down in a baking dish. Roll up all the cabbage leaves  this way and place tightly next to each other in the dish. Set aside.    Sauce: Melt margarine or butter in a heavy saucepan. Add onions and saut=82  until golden brown. Add flour and stir continuously until the flour is  roasted and a light brown color. Add the cabbage stock and the spices and  bring to a boil. Simmer for a few minutes. The consistency should be thin.  If needed, add more stock. Pour this sauce over the cabbage rolls in the  baking dish. Put in a preheated oven at 300=F8F. Bake until the cabbage is  tender and golden brown. Serve with parslied potatoes and apple sauce.          2    hours to prepare.
