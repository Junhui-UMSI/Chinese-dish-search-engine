Warm the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat.  Dip each  piece of bread into the batter, turning them to coat both sides.  Fry until  brown on both sides.  Serve with yogurt and fresh fruit, fruit syrup, etc.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /EGGS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
