Ziti with Roasted Red Pepper Garlic Sauce
Portobello mushroom, Salt/pepper, Ziti, Balsamic vinegar, garlic, Sweet red bell pepper, Fatfree sour cream, 
"Saute" the mushroom slices in the vinegar/water mixture until the liquid  is evaporated and the mushrooms are quite wilted and decreased in size, at  least       15    minutes.    Meanwhile, preheat the broiler and bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Split the pepper in half lengthwise, deseed, and place on a baking sheet  skin side up. Roast the pepper until the skin is charred, checking  frequently after the first 3 minutes. When the pepper is charred, remove  from the oven and place the halves in a closed brown paper bag for 10  minutes or so. When the water boils, add the pasta. When the pepper is  cool, peel and cut into      1/2    inch strips.    In a blender, place the sour cream or yogurt or ricotta, the garlic, the  pepper strips, and the salt/pepper if using.  Puree.    When the pasta is al dente, drain, and place it back in the pot.  Top with  mushroom and sauce and stir to coat.
