Ranch Chicken
Olive oil, Ranch dressing, Skinless boneless chicken, Italian-style bread crumbs, 
1. Dip chicken into dressing, then coat with bread crumbs.    2. Heat oil in 12" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in  oil 12 to 15 minutes, turning once, until outside is golden brown and juice  is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut.    NOTES : Everyone liked this. Try light salad dressing next time to reduce  the fat content.
