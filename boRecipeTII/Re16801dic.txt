All Chocolate Cheesecake
Flour, Vanilla extract, Sour cream, cream cheese, Eggs, Semi-sweet chocolate, Chocolate wafer crumbs, Butter, Sugar, Ground cinnamon, 
Mix crumbs, cinnamon, and butter together and press into a 9-inch  springform pan.  Bake at 350 for 10 minutes.  Remove and cool.    Mix together cream cheese and sugar until well blended.  Beat in flour. Add  eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Beat in sour cream.  Blend in the melted chocolate and vanilla.  Pour over prepared crust. Bake  at 425F for 15 minutes that then lower oven to 300F.  Bake for an  additional 45 minutes and then turn oven off and allow the cake to cool  down with the oven for an hour.  Remove from oven and cool completely.  Refrigerate.    I garnish this with chocolate whipped cream and put a little chocolate  syrup in a nice design over the whipped cream.
