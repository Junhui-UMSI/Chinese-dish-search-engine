Place  over medium heat and stir occasionally with a wooden spoon until mixture  comes to a boil. Clip on candy thermometer. Cook to 234 F (115 C) or soft-  ball stage. Pour, without scraping, into baking pan. Cool to lukewarm. Add  vanilla. Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture thickens. Add nuts and  continue stirring until candy loses its gloss. Scrape out onto plastic  wrap. Pat into a loaf shape (about 9" x 5"). Slice and serve, or wrap in  plastic and store in the refrigerator for several weeks. VARIATION: Use 1  teaspoon maple extract instead of vanilla. Shared by ELLIE COLLIN, Prodigy  ID# CMKD93F.
