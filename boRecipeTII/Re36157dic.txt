From: Bulldogfla <Bulldogfla@aol.com>    by Mimi Rippee    To prepare the meat, place the rump along with the bones and knuckle into  an 8 quart stewpot. Add the beef stock. Cover and bring to a boil. Remove  all the foam and scum from the surface of the water.    Melt the butter in a skillet and saute the onions and carrots for 5 to 6  minutes.    Meanwhile, reduce the heat under the pot of meat and skim the stock again.  Add the onions and carrots to the stock. Also add the tomato, bouquet  garni, the peppercorns and salt. Skim again. Partially cover the pot and  simmer slowly, skimming as necessary, for 2-1/2 hours. The meat should be  almost tender when pierced with a knife. Transfer the meat to a plate and  cover. Remove the bones from the stock and scoop out the marrow. Reserve  marrow and discard bones.    Strain the stock through a fine sieve. Discard the vegetables and skim the  surface fat from the stock. Clean the pot, then return the sieved stock to  it. Return the meat to the stock and add the following "vegetables":    Bring the stock to a boil and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Transfer the  meat to a carving board, remove the strings, and carve the roast into thin  slices. Arrange on a heated platter. Place vegetables around meat. Sprinkle  with 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley, if desired. Add chopped marrow to  stock and skim as much fat as possible from the stock. Serve along with  meat and vegetables, if desired.
