York Peppermint Pattie
Powdered sugar, Egg white, Bag semisweet chocolate, Light corn syrup, Peppermint oil or extract, Chips (16-ounce), Cornstarch for dusting, 
In a medium bowl, beat the egg white until it is tiff and forms peaks.  Dont use a plastic bowl for this. Slowly add the powdered sugar while  blending with an electric mixer set on medium speed. Add the corn  syrup and peppermint oil or extract and knead the mixture with your  hands until is has the smooth consistency of dough. Using a surface  and rolling pin lightly dusted with cornstarch, roll out the  peppermint dough 1/4-inch thick. Punch out circles of peppermint  dough with a biscuit cutter or a clean can with a diameter of about 2  1/2-inches. Make approximately 20, place them on plates or cookie  sheets, and let them firm up in the refrigerator, about 45 minutes.  Melt the chocolate chips in a microwave set on high for 2 minutes.  Stir halfway through the heating time. Melt thoroughly, but do not  overheat. Drop each patty into the chocolate and coat completely.  Using 2 forks, one in each hand, lift the coated patty from the  chocolate. Gently tap the forks against the bowl to knock off the  excess chocolate and place each patty on waxed paper. Chill the  peppermint patties until firm, about 30 minutes.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
