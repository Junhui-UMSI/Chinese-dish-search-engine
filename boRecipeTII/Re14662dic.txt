From: mackey.1@osu.edu (Lynda Mackey)    Date: 29 Sep 1994 21:46:42 GMT  This recipe won first place in a special competition at the Ohio State Fair  this year: Cooking with Ohios Soy Foods, sponsored by the Ohio Soybean  Council. It also received an "award of Excellence" rosette.    You can also use this recipe in a bread machine, either by going through  the whole cycle, or by using the dough setting and shaping the dough into a  large braid, which is what I usually do.. If youre not wild about soy, you  can change the soy milk to water, and the soy oil to another kind of oil.  Instructions:    1. Mix the soy milk, honey, and yeast and set it aside for 10 minutes.    2. Combine the bread flour and soy flour in a large bowl.    3. Add the oil, eggs, and egg yolk to the milk, honey, and yeast mixture.  Stir with a wooden spoon until blended.    4. Add the flours to the liquid mixture, stir until a dough is formed, and  turn the dough out onto a floured board.    5. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.    6. Form into a ball, coat with a bit of soybean oil, and place in a covered  bowl.    7. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about an hour.    8. Punch the dough down, knead about 3 minutes, and braid or shape into any  desired form.    9. Transfer to a greased baking sheet. Cover and let rise until doubled,  about       45    minutes.    10. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    11. Beat the egg white with a folk. Use a brush to coat the top of the  loaf. Sprinkle poppy seeds on top of loaf.    12. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.    13. Cool on a rack.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
