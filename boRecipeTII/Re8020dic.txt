Potato and Corn Chowder William
Stick Butter Or Margarine;, Lge Potatoes; peeled, Ears Corn On The Cob;, White Roux*; as needed, Salt, Onion (Optional); finely, White Pepper; to taste, Milk; as needed, Accent Seasoning Mix (Msg);, Chicken Base**, All-Purpose Flour; as needed, Water; as needed, 
* (sometimes called "Whitewash" if uncooked ) For thickening to desired  consistency. It consists of equal parts of fat of some type and flour. For  this recipe I use 1/4 lb (1 stick) of *butter* and whisk in flour till  roux will barely drop from spoon. Cook just long enough to remove "floury"  taste--*do not* brown. Set aside.    **Chicken base or granules are quite salty. Taste for salt before adding  any table salt.    With a french knife/cooks knife, slice corn from cob. Lightly chop to  break up "strips" of kernels. Place in crockpot.    Wash and peel potatoes. Cut into medium size chunks. Place in crockpot.    If you want to use the onion, saute in a little butter until translucent  and add to crock pot.    Add just enough *hot* tap water to barely cover potatoes.    Set crockpot on medium, cover and go do something else for about 4 hours.  When the potatoes test done, stir in chicken base and add 3 cups milk.  Bring back to simmer. Gently stir in roux a little at a time till desired  consistency is reached. Lower crockpot to "simmer" untill time to serve.  Stir in a generous shake or 2 of Accent at this point (if desired), and  serve.    If the chowder thickens considerably, thin with milk.    Makes 6 to 8 main dish servings (12 oz) or about 20 appetizer servings (6  oz.)    billspa@icanect.net    NOTES : There may be roux left over.  Refrigerate and save for another us=  e. Try to use up within a reasonable amount of time. You can also cook it  t= ill it browns for a brown roux.
