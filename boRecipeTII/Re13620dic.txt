Set porcini and warm water in a skillet and bring to a simmer; let  mushrooms soak for 20 minutes or until tender. (Take advantage of this time  to make your scallop and raddichio salad.)    Drain the soaked porcini and rinse them to remove any grit and chop. Strain  soaking liquid through a paper lined sieve to remove any grit; reserve.    Saute shallots in 1 tablespoon olive oil.
