This recipe is from the November/December issue of the Vegetarian Journal.  It says that rutabagas may be substituted for the turnips. I have adapted  it for FF.    Preheat oven to 350F. In a large skillet, saute onion and garlic in your  favourite liquid. Spray a 2-quart casserole dish with Pam and make a layer  of sauerkraut and caraway seeds (I presume they mean to mix them together -  thats what I did). Add turnips and mustard in another layer (again, I  mixed them together). Top mixture with sauteed onions. Bake, uncovered, for  30 minutes. Stir before serving. Serves 6. The VJ says that it has 78  calories and 2 g fat per serving, but they sauteed the onions in oil and  greased the dish.    A word of caution - if the turnips have been hanging out in your fridge for  too long, they will develop a harsh flavour.
