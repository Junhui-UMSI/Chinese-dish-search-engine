Pass the hot potatoes through a food mill and cool. Lightly knead in  the flour. Add the egg yolk, ricotta and ricotta salads and knead  lightly. Add the chard, cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper, mix well and  knead until smooth. Do not over-knead.    Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into 1/2" ropes and  cut into 3/4" lengths. Chill for at least 45 minutes.    Bring 3 quarts of salted water to the boil and add the gnocchi in  three batches. Cook until they rise to the top and remove with a  slotted spoon.    Warm the chicken broth and whisk in the garlic puree, olive oil, salt  and pepper. Divide the gnocchi into 8 dishes, ladle with the broth  and garnish with prociutto and cheese.    Note: To roast garlic, remove the papery skin from the whole head and  slice off 1/4" across the top. Place garlic in a small baking dish and  drizzle with olive oil. Cover with foil and cook for 30 minutes at  350F. Remove foil and cook 20 minutes longer, or until soft.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
