Zucchini Squares
Eggs -- or egg substitute, Thinly sliced zucchini, Grated Parmesan cheese, Bisquick, Clove garlic -- finely, Chopped parsley**, Chopped, Vegatable oil, Pepper -- to taste, Chopped onion -- or more, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 350.  grease a 13x9x2" pan.  In a large mixing bowl combine  all ingredients.  add zucchini last.  Trasfer to pan.  bake 30 min or until  golden brown.  let cool and cut into squares.  if you cut them about 2x1"  they make 12 squares, if you cut them smaller they are great as appetizers.  I like them best the next day at room temperature.
