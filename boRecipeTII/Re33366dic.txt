Basic Vinaigrette (Cooks Garden)
(good quality), Dijon mustard, olive oil, Red wine vinegar, Garlic clove; crushed, 
In a small bowl, make a paste of the vinegar, the mustard and the garlic.  Begin whisking in the oil a few drops at a time, then in a thin stream,  until all the oil has been added and the mixture is emulsified. Season to  taste with salt and pepper.  Voila!    Make a delicious variation by substituting balsamic vinegar and honey  mustard.    From: The Cooks Garden catalog - Spring/Summer 1993 (page 65)
