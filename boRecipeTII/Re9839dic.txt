This is the kind of dish that is fun to create with ingredients that were  common and popular during Colonial times. It is terribly easy for us to  cook this way. In the old days it was a pain!      Place the diced pumpkin in a covered 2-quart saucepan. Add the broth and  butter or olive oil; top with the onions. Cover and simmer until the  pumpkin is just tender, about l5 minutes. Add the ham and corn and cook  until the corn is tender, about 8 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.  Top with toasted shelled pumpkin seeds.      This dish can become a whole meal in itself or it can be served along  with a holiday meal as a vegetable dish. I am sure that is how it was used  in earlier days.    NOTE:  Toasted pumpkin seeds are available at most gourmet shops or health  food stores. If the seeds are raw, toast them in a frying pan with a tiny  bit of olive oil and salt.
