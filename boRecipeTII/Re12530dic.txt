Rinse and cook the lentils.  Bring to boil in 3 cups water.  Reduce  heat to a simmer.  Simmer about 30 minutes, adding more water if  necessary, until lentils are tender.   Should make about 3 cups  cooked lentils.    Meanwhile, saute the onions and garlic in the niter kebbeh, until the  onions are just translucent.  Add the berbere, cumin, and paprika and  saute for a few minutes more, stirring occasionally to prevent  burning. Mix in the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste and simmer for  another 5 to 10 minutes.  Add 1 cup of vegetable stock or water and  continue simmering.    When the lentils are cooked, drain them and mix them into the saute  mixture.  Add the green peas and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add  salt and pepper to taste.    To serve Yemiser Wet, spread layers of injera on individual plates.  Place some yogurt of cottage cheese alongside a serving of wet on  the injera and pass more injera at the table.  To eat, tear off  pieces of injera, fold it around bits of stew, and, yes, eat it with  your fingers.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/ethiopia.zip
