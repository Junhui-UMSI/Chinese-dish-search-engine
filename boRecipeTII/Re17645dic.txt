Add tarragon, stir until it is softened.    Pour mixture into a bowl of food processor. Add remaining ingredients.  Process until mixture is smooth. Add cheese if you prefer a more spreadable  consistency. Spoon into a serving bowl. Top with garnish of your choice.  Makes    1-1/2    cups.    People who do not like ordinary pate seem to love this one. Vary the herbs  and substitute the vegetables as you wish. Serve with water crackers, thick  slices of crusty French bread, thin slices of whole wheat bread, or  unsalted whole wheat crackers. May be frozen.    VARIATIONS: ~ Substitute other vegetables for the mushrooms (maybe  broccoli.) ~ Substitute 1/2 t fennel for the tarragon and 1 c whole pecans  for the    almonds ~ vary the flavor by using other seasonings such as basil, oregano,  dillweed,    curry powder, or nutmeg.
