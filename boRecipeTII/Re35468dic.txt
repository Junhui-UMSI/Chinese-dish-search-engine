Beef Jerky
Garlic powder, Black Pepper, Soy sauce, Crushed hot red chiles; to, Liquid smoke flavoring, Brown sugar, Beef top round roast, 
Trim off all the fat and silverskin from the roast. Cut 1/8-inch the meat  into 1/8-inch slices. Separate roast into its natural sections before  slicing results it meat pieces about the right size. Mix the smoke  flavoring, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, pepper, and chiles and let stand for 5  minutes. Then place in a bowl with a tight seal big enough for the marinade  and cut meat; let stand 10 minutes for flavors to develop. Layer meat in  the bowl so that each side gets coated with marinade and cover tightly. Let  stand about 10 minutes, shaking bowl and inverting every few minutes to  cover all pieces evenly. Longer marinating does not change the flavor.  Drain meat in sieve or colander and place in single layers on the  dehydrator trays. (Takes about 7 trays for 5 pounds of meat.) Dry according  to your dehydrator instructions. Enjoy.    NOTES : I prefer top round because of the large clear sections of meat,  however, almost any cut will do if you trim the meat well. This marinade  also works well with fish and turkey.  Recipe by: Jerry Morrow    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 215 by "Laura J.Bettingen"  <labette@sprynet.com> on Nov 7, 1997
