(original recipe by Ellen Lord)    Cook pasta while cooking sauce, so theyre done at about the same time.  Cook onion and garlic until almost golden in a non-stick pan in the liquid  you prefer. Add wine to deglaze the pan. Add the mushrooms, herbs and  pepper. Lower the heat and simmer until the mushrooms are almost done. Add  the tomatoes and their liquid and the stock and cook until the stock just  comes to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan if necessary. Add the  pasta, mix well and heat through.
