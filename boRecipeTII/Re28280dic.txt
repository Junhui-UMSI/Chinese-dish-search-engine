Sift the first five ingredients together.  Add the nuts. Make a well in the  centre and add milk, vanilla and melted shortening. Stir lightly and pour  batter into a greased casserole. SAUCE: Measure cocoa, brown sugar, hot  water and orange rind into a bowl and beat well. Pour over batter. Bake for  35 to 40 minutes at 350F. As this dessert bakes, the batter rises through  the rich chocolate sauce. Serve it hot with whipped cream or vanilla ice  cream. Source: Chatelaine Golden Anniversary ch.  MM: Honey Tarts
