Picardia (Jicama Salad)
Mint leaves, chopped, Serrano chiles, stemed and, Jicama (about 6" in, Lettuce leaves, Jalapeno chiles, stemed and, Limes, 
Put the chopped jicama in a bowl. Squeeze the limes and pour the juice over  the jicama. Mix chopped chiles and mint leaves into jicama and lime juice.  Serve on lettuce leaves.    >From the book:    Shoppers and Mercado Libertad wouldnt think of buying jicama without the  tubers leaves attached. "No leaves is the sure sign of age," claims Senora  Anguiano at her stall of precisely arranged vegetables, netxt to a  three-foot pile of freshlyunearthed jicama,...a large tuber with a sweet  taste and the texture of water chestnuts. People of Jalisco eat refreshing  jicama often, as a minced salsa ingredient, sliced in green salads, sliced  into spear and sprinkled with chile powder, or chopped in picardia. Senora  Anguianos daughters, both teenagers, love huge amounts of this  low-calorie, delicious, easy-to-prepare salad.    Note: probably wont find them with leaves on in the US.
