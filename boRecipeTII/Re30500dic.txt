Saute onion, garlic & beef in oil. Drain fat. Add salt & spices & stir  over heat 1 minute. Stir in (I like to puree them with juice in can)  tomatoes & chilies. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, until excess  liquid is evaporated (30 minutes).    Heat oven to 350^. Lightly oil 9 * 13" pan. Combine cottage & Jack  cheeses with egg in medium bowl. Place overlapping layer of half of  tortillas in baking dish. Spread with meat mixture. Top with remaining  tortillas and spread with cheese mixture. Bake until topping is firm in  center, about 30 minutes. Let casserole stand for 5 minutes. Top with layer  of lettuce, then sprinkle with tomatoes, cheddar, olives & green onion. Cut  into rectangles & serve immediately. 10 servings, FROM: LYNN HERRICK  (RFWK29A)  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Feb 25, 98
