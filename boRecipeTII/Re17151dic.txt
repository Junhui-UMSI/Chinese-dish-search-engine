These were originally posted by Virginia Sauer and are easy and wonderful.    . Pour water into saucepan large enough to hold yams. Bring to a boil.    . Boil yams until tender.    . Discard water, peel yams, and cut them in half lengthwise. (THIS STEP CAN  BE DONE UP TO A FULL DAY AHEAD OF TIME AND SET ASIDE UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO  BAKE THE YAMS.)    . Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.    . Butter baking dish (approximately 12x8 inches).    . Arrange yams, cut side down, in single layer in baking dish. (If  necessary, overlapping is okay.)    . Using a wire whisk, mix together remaining ingredients. (Since the butter  will melt when the mixture bakes, do not worry about lumps of shortening.)  THIS STEP CAN BE DONE EARLIER IN THE DAY, AND POURED OVER THE YAMS WHEN  READY TO BAKE.    . Pour orange juice mixture over the yams, trying to coat each yam.    . Bake for 1 1/2 hours, basting approximately every 15 minutes.    YIELD: 4 - 6 servings    N. B. These reheat perfectly.
