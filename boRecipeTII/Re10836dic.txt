Rinse quinoa under running water and drain.  Place the quinoa and water in  a large saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat; this should  take about 5 minutes. Remove the cover and lower the heat; simmer 10  minutes longer.  Drain the quinoa and cool. While the quinoa is cooking,  make the vinaigrette.  In a bowl, whisk together the lime juice, pepper,  chile and salt. Gradually add the olive oil, stirring constantly. Set  aside. When the grain has cooled, assemble the salad. In a bowl place the  quinoa with the cucumber, tomato, scallions, parsley and mint. Toss to mix  the ingredients, then add the vinaigrette and toss thoroughly. Season to  taste with salt and white pepper.
