$500.00 Fudge
Dash salt, Can evaporated milk, Butter, DIANE ABERNATHY MNFH58A, Chocolate chips, Sugar, Vanilla, 
Cook sugar and canned milk to rolling boil for 6 minutes; Stirring  constantly. Use large stainless steel pot; remove from heat. Add butter,  chocolate chips, vanilla, and dash of salt    Stit until mixed. Pour into buttered pan.  Let stand 6 hours before  cutting.  Will keep a long time in cookie tin or a sealed container in a  cool place.    * The original recipe calls for 1/2 lb butter, but I find that the butter  "pools" on top of the finished fudge. I only use 12 T of butter and my  fudge turns out fine!
