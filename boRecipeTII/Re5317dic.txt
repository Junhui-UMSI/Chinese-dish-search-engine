Seeing I havent posted in quite a while, I thought that I would post  lowfat from the Taste of Home Lowfat Country Cooking. Out of 455 recipes I  only have 44 formatted. Plan on formatting the rest this week. Hope you all  enjoy these.    In a bowl, combine baking mix, cereal, banana, apple, raisins and pine  nuts. In another bowl, beat eggs, milk and vanilla; stir into the dry  ingredients just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto a lightly  greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes. Cook until  second side is golden brown. Serve immediately.
