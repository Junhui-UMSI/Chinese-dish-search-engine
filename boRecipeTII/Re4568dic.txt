Granulated sugar, Unsalted butter, All-purpose flour, Eggs, Grated zest of 2 lemons, 
Source:Dessert Sensations Fresh from France by Faye Levy    These cookies are very quick and easy to make. They are shaped by pushing  the batter from a spoon, like many American cookies, but then are flattened  by tapping the baking sheet vigorously several times on the work surface so  that they will be crisp.    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.    Lightly butter two (2) baking sheets.    Beat butter until soft and smooth. Add sugar and beat until smooth. Add 1  egg and beat until blended. Beat second egg in a small bowl, then gradually  beat it into mixture. Stir in lemon zest. Sift flour over mixture and stir  it in with a wooden spoon. Let batter stand 15 minutes at room temperature.    To shape cookies, take 1/2 teaspoon of batter and use another teaspoon to  push batter onto baking sheet. Space cookies about 3-inches apart. TAP  baking sheet vigorously several times on work surface to flatten cookies.    Bake 6-7 minutes, or until edges of cookies are brown and centers light  beige. Transer to a rack to cool. (If cookies harden and become difficult  to remove, return them to oven for 30 seconds to soften.) Cool baking  sheets and bake remaining cookies.    Cookies can be kept about 1 week in an airtight container; or they can be  frozen.
