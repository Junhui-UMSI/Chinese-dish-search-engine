Youve probably tasted it even if you dont    realize it: Tamarind is the key flavoring in Worcestershire sauce &    Pickapeppa sauce. Fresh tamarind can be found at specialty produce &  Hispanic    markets. Both Hispanic & Asian markets sell gummy balls of peeled tamarind    pulp, which can be turned into puree. Chipotle chiles are smoked jalapenos.
