Slice cheese into 30 slices about 1/4 inch thick.  Peel garlic and slice  each clove lengthwise into about 6 ovals.  Heat oil in deep, heavy  saucepan over medium-low heat.  Add garlic ovals and simmer 5 to 7  minutes, being careful not to burn or brown cloves.  Remove slices as they  float to the surface and are light brown in color.  Drain on paper towel.  Reserve oil for cheese.  Mince garlic and mix with Italian seasoning.  Spread half the cheese slices evenly with garlic mixture.  Press remaining  cheese slices on each of make 15 bars.  Dip flour-coated pieces into egg  again, then into bread crumbs mixed with parsley.  Be sure to cover sides.   Reheat oil to medium-high and fry cheese in oil a few pieces at a time  until lightly browned (takes about 2 minutes).  Skim particles from oil as  they accumulate.  Drain cheese on paper towels and keep warm until all are  fried.  Serve with toothpicks and Marinara Sauce for dipping.  Makes about       30    pieces.
