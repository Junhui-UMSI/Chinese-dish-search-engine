Notes: All about Our Bean Soup--Recipe for Bean Soup served in U.S.  House of Representatives Restaurant Bean Soup has been a featured item on  the menu of the House of Representatives Restaurant since long before that  day in 1904 when the then Speaker of the House, Joseph G. Cannon, of  Illinois, came into the House Restaurant and ordered Bean Soup. Then, as  now, Bean Soup was a hearty, zesty, and filling dish; but it was typically  hot and humid in Washington that day; and therefore, Bean Soup had been  omitted from the menu. "Thunderation," roared Speaker Cannon, "I had my  mouth set for Bean Soup," and, he continued, "from now on, hot or cold,  rain, snow, or shine, I want it on the menu every day." And so it has  been--Bean Soup on the menu every single day since. For our many friends  who over the years continue to ask for the recipe for this famous soup, we  print it herewith, just as it has always been made (adapted to family-size  quantity) in the House Restaurant Kitchen in the Capitol.  ~ - sent via an evaluation copy of BulkRate (unregistered).
