Wilted Spinach Salad with Pickled Shallots
Pickled Shallots, sliced, Pepitas, toasted, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Dijon mustard, Bunches spinach, stems, Crumbled Feta or Anejo, Black Pepper, Coarse salt, Sherry vinegar, 
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and  olive oil.    Just before serving, assemble all of the ingredients for the salad on the  counter. Turn on a stovetop burner to medium-high. Set a large stainless  steel bowl over the burner and heat until very hot. Using an oven mitt or  pot holder to protect your hands, pour the vinaigrette into the bowl and  swirl for a minute or two, until the vinaigrette is hot. Quickly add the  spinach and shallots and toss the salad with tongs to coat evenly. When the  spinach begins to wilt, remove from the heat and transfer to serving  plates. Sprinkle with the toasted pepitas and the cheese if desired. Serve  immediately.    Yield: 4 to 6 servings    NOTES : Cooking LIve    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8815    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #480 by Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net>  on Feb 11, 1997.
