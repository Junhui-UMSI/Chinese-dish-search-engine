Basic Chicken Velvet
Chicken breast, Egg whites, Water, 
Chicken Velvet, known also as Chicken Essence, is an elegant and festive  dish. It calls for chicken breast (skinned, boned and minced to a pulp) to  be combined with egg whites and then either sauteed in oil or poached  briefly in a rich concentrated stock. The basic preparation includes the  following steps:    1. Skin and bone the chicken breast; then pound flat with a mallet or the  side of a cleaver.    2. Cut the meat in 1-inch cubes; then mince or grind in any of the  following ways:     a. Mince on a hardwood cutting board, removing tendons.     b. Grind in a mortar and pestle. Remove tendons.     c. Blend at low speed in a blender, turning the motor on and off. Remove  and discard gristle that attaches to blades.     d. Run twice through a hand grinder (set at the finest setting). Remove  gristle.    3. During the mincing or grinding above, add about 1 tablespoon of water, a  drop at a time, to give the mixture a paste-like consistency. (Sherry may  be used in place of water.)    4. Beat the egg whites until fluffy, but not stiff and dry; then fold into  chicken mixture.    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4. Downloaded  from G Internet, G Internet.
