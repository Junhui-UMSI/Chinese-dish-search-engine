Ancho Honey Basted Salmon
Kosher salt, Honey, Balsamic vinegar, salmon, Ancho Chiles, Cointreau, Garlic, Orange Juice Concentrate, 
Soak ancho chiles in warm water to soften. Place all ingredients, except  for the salmon, in a food processor or blender. Puree mixture until chiles  are very fine. Pat salmon dry and coat with the chile paste. Place on a  broiler pan and broil 4 to 6 inches from heat for 10 minutes. Salmon should  flake easily with a fork. I have yet to try this recipe on the BBQ grill at  home, so if you try it let me know of the outcome.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #301 by ChefChile@aol.com on Feb 3, 1998
