Using a sharp serated knife, carefully cut a  large round opening in the top of the bread.  Remove the inside bread  evenly and trim top.  Lightly brush the inside of the bread and the inside  top with the Italian dressing.  Fill shell with spinach, layer of cheese,  onion, turkey, more cheese, tomato, cucumber and top with remaining cheese.  Wrap tightly in foil and bake in oven. Cool 10 minutes and cut into pie  shaped wedges.  Makes 6 to servings. I use a variety of cheeses and meats  such as all beef bologna, sliced ham and other cold cuts. I often delete  the spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, making a filling of cheeses  and meats.  This is wonderful served either hot or cold and can be made  several days in advance, ready to bake.  It is a very good recipe for  picnics and tailgate parties.
