In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine coffee and  liqueur. To assemble, split each ladyfinger in half, dip in coffee, liqueur  mixture and layer bottom of glass (9 x 13) dish. Top with half the cheese  mixture and half the heath bits; repeat layers ending with Heath Bits.  Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving; overnight is better.  Serves 8 generously.    You can substitute cream cheese for the Mascarpone (it isnt as good  though); and you can use Amaretto or Kaluha in place of the Tuca. Some of  my friends substitute brandy. thats a little strong for my taste, but feel  free to experiment!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
