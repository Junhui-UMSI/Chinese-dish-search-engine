Upside Down Apple Caramel Cake
Apples (peeled, cored,, Cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, Water, Sweet Rewards apple cinnamon, Egg, 
Place sliced apples in the bottom of a greased 10" round cake pan.  Drizzle  caramel over top. Mix cake mix with egg, water, and spices.  Pour over  apple caramel, spread to even out in pan. Bake in preheated 375 oven for  30+ minutes till done. Check with toothpick, but make sure not to poke it  into the apple caramel mix. (They will still be gooey.) When done, let it  rest for 5 mins., then flip over onto a plate. Serve warm with a scoop of  FF frozen vanilla ice cream. Mmmmm...    (I would have added a 1/4 C. of chopped walnuts to the bottom of the pan,  but my guests didnt like nuts. Brings up the fat anyway.)
