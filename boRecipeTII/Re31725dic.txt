In a small bowl, combine  all remaining ingredients.  Spread mixture over both sides of fish.  Cover  and refrigerate for 1 hour.    Prepare a charcoal fire or preheat gas grill.  Once the fire is at medium  heat, grill the steaks for 4 to 5 minutes per side.  The flesh should be  opaque.  Remove from the grill.  Cut each steak into two portions and  serve. Serves 4.    167 calories per serving:  19 G protein, 9 G fat, 3 G carbohydrate, 89 MG  sodium, 38 mg cholesterol.    Dots notes:  Ive made this using swordfish or yellowfin tuna.  I always  double the number of hot peppers (usually several large jalapenos or lots  of small serranos) and the garlic. I serve this with Chardonnay or  Sauvignon Blanc, vegetable, salad or slaw, & couscous or rice. Try to avoid  getting the turmeric on the counter top (it stains)! Enjoy!
