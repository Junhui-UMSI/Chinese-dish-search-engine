Beans for Burritos
Can Ortega green chiles,, Cloves garlic,, Onion, Salsa or to taste, Pink beans, Chili powder, Salt, 
Soak the beans overnight, changing water several times. Put beans in  crock-pot and cover with an inch or so of water. Add salt, onion, garlic,  and chili powder. Cook on low until beans are soft (about 18 hours? I  forget).    When beans are cooked, ladle off and reserve some of the liquid from the  top.  Mash the beans well.  (I never do this as well as Id like; Ive  tried a potato masher and an empty iced-tea jar.) Add reserved liquid as  necessary for consistency.  (I never have to add any, myself.) Stir in the  chopped chiles and the salsa; heat through.
