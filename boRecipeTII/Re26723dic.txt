Cant  say Ive tried it myself; I only bring back Cockspur VSOR and Im not about  to cut it with sherry. As for amounts, I mostly saw 12 oz bottles of rum in  the non-tourist stores and would use that as a starting point:    Remove stems from the peppers and place in a bottle, then cover with rum  and leave for two weeks. Strain and dilute to required "hotness" with  sherry.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #076    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
