Gently mix the ingredients together so that they are  well blended. In a medium bowl place the egg, egg white, and heavy cream.  Whisk the ingredients together. Add the oil and ground turkey, and mix them  in with your hands.  Add the cilantro and mix it in. Add the bread crumb  mixture, and mix it in well with your hands. Shape the meat mixture into 8  patties that are the size of the bread slices. Preheat the oven to 350F.  Place the patties in a baking pan and bake them for 10 minutes on each  side, or until they are firm. On each slice of the bread place a slice of  cheese and tomato. Place the bread slices under a preheated broiler until  the cheese has melted. Place one baked sausage patty on top of each grilled  bread piece.  Top it with the Southwestern Slaw. Serve the Black Bean  Relish on the side.
