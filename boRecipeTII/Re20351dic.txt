Veal Scaloppine with Lemon and Fennel
juice and zest of 1 lemon, Flour, Virgin olive oil, Veal hip, Chicken broth, fennel, Italian parsley, 
Core fennel and cut in half. Cut each half into 1/8th-inch julienne.    In a 10- to 12-inch saute pan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium  heat until just smoking. Add fennel and cook, stirring often until soft and  golden, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Slice veal  into 1/8th-inch thick slices (or arrange to have your butcher do this for  you). Pound each piece of veal with a meat hammer until nearly paper thin.  Season each piece with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Heat remaining  4 tablespoons olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch saute pan until smoking. Add 4  pieces dredged veal and cook until light golden brown on each side, about 2  minutes. Remove to plate and continue with remaining pieces. When second  batch is browned, add first batch back into pan and add chicken broth and  lemon juice and cook 2 to 3 minutes, until liquid is nearly gone. Remove  veal to platter, add fennel and parsley and pour sauce over meat. Sprinkle  with lemon zest and serve.
