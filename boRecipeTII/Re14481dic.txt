Whole-Grain Pancake Mix
Cornmeal, Baking Powder, Rolled oats, Whole wheat flour, Brown sugar, Salt, Nonfat milk powder, 
Last week I found this recipe in the San Jose Mercury News. Over the  weekend I prepared the mix, divided it into three bags, and prepared gift  baskets that included herbal tea and maple syrup from Trader Joes.    I changed the recipe as follows:    ~-Replaced 1/2 cup sesame seeds with 1/2 cup oats    ~-Replaced 1/2 cup sunflower seeds with 1/4 cup cornmeal    ~-In the recipe instructions I included with my gifts I replaced 2 eggs  with egg substitute and 1/4 cup oil with 1/4 cup applesauce.    Mix all ingredients well. Youll have about 12 cups, enough for 6 batches  of pancakes.    To use: Mix 1/2 cup liquid egg substitute, 1 cup water, and 1/4 cup  applesauce in a large bowl. Stir pancake mix in bag before measuring 2 cups  and adding it to the bowl. Stir until just blended; a few lumps are okay.  Let batter rest for about 5 minutes before cooking on a greased griddle or  frying pan. You may need to add more water---start with a tablespoon or  so---if the batter is too thick to drop from a spoon. Serves 3-4.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #296 by bwatson@cisco.com (Bethann D.
