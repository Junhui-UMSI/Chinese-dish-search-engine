Chicken Barbecue Sauce
Lemon juice, Catsup, Chickens; 1-1/2 or 2 pound,, Butter, Horseradish, Salt, Worcestershire, Tabasco, 
Place on grill and baste with sauce or bake in 350? oven. I like it with  more lemon juice and tabasco.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by ddmmom@popalex1.linknet.net on Sep 21,  1998,
