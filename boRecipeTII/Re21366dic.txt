Unfried French Fries
Pam, Baking potatoes, Cajun seasoning, egg whites, 
from "In the Kitchen With Rosie" (Oprah Winfreys new cook that moved to  Chicago to cook for her).    Prehat oven to  400.  Wash baking potatoes and slice lengthwise into potato  rounds about 1/4"  thick.  Slice potato rounds into matchstick potaato  slices.  Combine egg whites and Cajun seasoning in a bowl. Put matchstick  potatoes into bowl and coat with egg white/spice mixture. Spray a large  baking sheet with  3 quick sprays of Pam and place coated potatoes on  baking sheet.  Cook in oven for 40 - 45 minutes turning every 6 - 8 minutes  to make sure the fries are crispy. Remove from oven and enjoy!    Tonya    P.S. The recipe in the cookbook called for 5 large baking potatoes - I used  only 2 large baking potatoes and filled up 3 baking sheets with french  fries! When I buy large baking potatoes here in Fla., they are about 1 - 1  1/2 lbs. each.   So I guess it depends on how large your "large" baking  potato is.    From: <TWEBB@dean.med.ufl.edu>..
