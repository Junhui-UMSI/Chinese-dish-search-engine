Chocolate Tofu Frosting -Lf
Semisweet chocolate chips, Tofu Mori-nu, Rum, Vanilla, 
1. Pour chocolate into a microwave safe bowl. Heat in a microwave oven on  half power until chocolate is soft, 2 to 2+1/2 minutes.    2. Meanwhile in a blender combine tofu, rum and vanilla. Whirl until  smoothly pureed.    3. Stir chocolate until smooth. Scrape into blender with tofu mixture.  Whirl until smoothly pureed. Pour into a bowl and nest in ice water. Stir  often until frosting is cold, 10 to 12 minutes. Use or cover airtight and  chill up to 2 days, stir before spreading.    MAKES 2 cups; enough for a 2-layer 8- or 9-inch cake, a 9- by 13-inch cake,  or 2 dozen cupcakes.    PANTRY: run, orange or coffee flavor liqueur, or water may be used to  flavor the frosting.    [PER TABLESPOON: 39 cal, 40% cff (19cal) with regular tofu. 29 cals, 49%cff  (14 cals) with low fat tofu.]    NOTES : Lori Peterkin of Albuquerque uses high-protein, shelf-stable tofu  (nonrefrigerated) instead of butter in chocolate frosting. The frosting is  so smooth, cool, and creamy that her kids also like it as a pudding. Enough  for 2-dozen cupcakes. Time: 20 mins plus chill time. *Recipe taken from the  "Kitchen Cabinet" column of Readers Recipes tested in Sunsets kitchens.
