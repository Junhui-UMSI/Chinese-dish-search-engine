NOTE: "This dish goes together with a flick of the whisk. It has a good  dairy flavor and is the kind of cheese and egg dish that is often made for  breakfast parties in California. And it is perfect to make ahead and take  along to a potluck because it can be reheated and is always a hit with  guests. Serve it with ham, bacon or sausages."
