Cold water, Eggs, Salt, Sugar, Butter, Scalded milk, Pearl tapioca, 
Mrs. Gordon S. Adams & Gurna Gilbert    This and other recipes attributed jointly to Mrs. Gordon S. Adams and Gurna  Gilbert came from hand-written recipes in an autograph album collected by  Mrs. Gilbert; they were made available by Mrs. Adams, her daughter-in-law.  Soak the tapioca for 1 hour in cold water to cover; drain it; add it to the  milk; and cook it gently for 1/2 hour.    Beat the eggs slightly, and add the salt and sugar to them; pour them  gradually over the hot tapioca mixture;    turn this into a pudding dish; add the butter; and bake 30 minutes in a  moderate (350?) oven.
