*Note: The noodles and sauce must be at room temperature when tossed and  served. If cold, the sauce will lose its creamy consistency.    To make peanut sauce, combine ginger, garlic, 1 tablespoon green onion,  peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, chili paste, sugar, sesame and vegetable  oils, sherry, dry mustard, salt and chicken stock. Blend thoroughly. Cover  and set aside. Do not refrigerate.    To make noodles, cook fettuccini until tender. While noodles are still  warm, toss with oil until well coated. Chill. Place carrots in sieve and  pour boiling water over them. Immediately pat dry with paper towels and  chill. Wrap julienned green onions, ham, bean sprouts, cucumber and red  pepper separately and chill until serving time. Bring noodles to room  temperature before serving. At serving time, place noodles in center of  large round bowl or platter. Arrange vegetables and ham attractively in  separate mounds around edge. Blend peanut sauce again and pour over  noodles, vegetables and ham. Toss.    Created by: Hugh Carpenter, Los Angeles
