Nutmeg, Hot fudge sauce, Sugar, Cinnamon, AZTECA form; bake and fill, Super premium vanilla ice, COOL WHIP, 
Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Remove salad shell package from refrigerator  and let stand at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes or until salad  shells are soft and pliable. Mix Sugar, cinnmon and nutmeg together in  small bowl. Carefully remove ice cream from container, making sure it  remains well frozen. (cutting it away with sharp scissors works best). Cut  ice cream block into four equal sized rounds. Place one ice cream round in  center of each unbaked salad shell. Carefully wrap salad shell around ice  cream, making sure ice cream is totally enclosed. Place smooth side up,  spaced well apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with sugar/spice  mixture. Bake for three minutes or until crust just begins to turn golden  in color. Remove from oven and place on serving dishes. Let stand for two  minutes to allow shell to continue to crisp. (the ice cream will not melt).  Top with hot fudge sauce, garnish with Cool Whip and serve immediately.
