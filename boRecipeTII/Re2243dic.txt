Baked Opakapaka (Snapper) Fillets with Macadamia Crust
Butter, Snapper fillets, Pepper, macadamia nuts, Parsley, Lemon juice, 
My favorite cookbook is "Fish Dishes of the Pacific from the Fishwife" by  Shirley Rizzuto. Most of the recipes are the type that anyone can cook, but  there are also recipes from famous chefs and famous seafood restaurants  like Chef Chock Hoo Loui and the John Dominis Restaurant.    In Hawaii we call pink snapper, Opakapaka. Heres my favorite recipe from  my favorite cookbook,    Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Oil a baking pan with 1 tablespoon of the  butter. Place the fish in the pan, and sprinkle with pepper and lemon  juice. In a small skillet heat the rest of the butter. Add the ground nuts.  Stir and cook for 1-2 minutes making sure the mixture doesnt burn. Spread  the mixture over the fish. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until done. Sprinkle  with parsley and serve.    Changes I make: I like to add a clove of garlic, minced and about 1/4 cup  of any light white wine. I only bake this fish for 8-10 minutes.
