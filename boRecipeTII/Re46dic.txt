Combine pumpkin, sugar, beaten eggs, butter, spices, etc in a mixing bowl.  Mix thoroughly. Pour into pie shell bake at 350 degrees approximately 45 -  50 minutes or until pie is firmly set.    Kaes Dairy Pie shell:    Use a pastry cutter to cut butter into flour, added ice water etc and use  hands to work into a soft ball. Use flour to assist in making your ball, go  lightly on the flour. Roll out and place in your pie pan. Use a fork to  prick holes in the bottom so your pie shell will cook evenly. The cinnamon  really adds flavor to this pie recipe.    Also you can cook this recipe by doubling the pie portion and pouring into  a glass casserole pan, (do not use a crust) butter the bottom of the glass  pan before pouring in pie mixture and cover top with brown sugar, broken  pecans, and then take a stick of butter cutting into little tiny pieces  placing on the top of the brown sugar. Bake until set about 50 minutes at  350 degrees, and the top will be a brown sugar crunchy top and a pumpkin  pie bottom. Sooooo gooood!!!! Cut into squares serve with cool whip or  whipped cream. Its a pie without a crust. I suppose you could use a crust  for the bottom if you wanted to. This is always a hit for my family. You  want the pan to be wide and your pie filling to be about 3/4 of an inch  thick. Not too thick so it will cook thoroughly. Great noshing!!!!
