1. Soak dried mushrooms in 2 cups hot water for 30 minutes. Drain and  strain out sand, reserving liquid and mushrooms separately.    2. Put rice, saffron or saffron flowers, mushroom liquor, and water in rice  cooker and set to cook and keep.    3. Dry-roast all remaining spices and herbs. Add sauteing liquid with onion  and celery and saute for a few minutes. Add carrots. Add mushrooms and  green pepper, each time sauteing for several minutes (add more liquid if  necessary). Add tomatoes and beans.    4. Simmer 10 minutes, uncovered, allowing some of the liquid to evaporate.    5. Serve over or mixed with rice.    NOTES : 1. I used 1 tsp olive oil to saute in, and no additional liquid. 2.  For mushroom broth, I had previously soaked mushrooms for another recipe  and not used them.  I had also roasted some garlic.  I added the skins from  the roasted garlic to the saved mushroom broth and simmered them together,  making a delicious and very aromatic vegetable broth.  This is what I used  to cook the rice in. 3. Im sure any kind of dried mushrooms will do. I  just used what I happened to have on hand. Likewise for the beans; I had  originally thought of using black beans, but didnt happen to have any. 4.  It sounds like a lot of ingredients, but it didnt take long to make.  Dry-roasting the spices is a critical step, as it brings out their flavor.
