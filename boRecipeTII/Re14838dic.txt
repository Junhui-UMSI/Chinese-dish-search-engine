SERVES 18 NORMAL PERSONS OR 4 CHICAGO FIREFIGHTERS      Everybody knows that there is no such thing as a 19-alarm fire. Why, that  would mean that babies, lifeguards, bartenders, everyone, would have to  show up to fight it! However, Frank Jacobson of the Chicago Fire Department  thinks his chili requires 19 alarms. I am ready!      Please note that he makes this in small batches. If you do not know what  a #10 can is, figure on just under a gallon.      In a large pot bring the tomato pur?e and whole tomatoes to a slow boil.  While this is heating, brown the ground beef with chopped onion. Add this  to the tomato mixture. Add chili powder and simmer for 1 hour. Add oregano,  salt, and pepper to taste and simmer 15 minutes. Add kidney beans and  simmer 30 minutes.      Serve in a bowl with Cheddar cheese on top and a dollop of sour cream  placed in the center. Diced yellow onions complete the garnish.      "Following the meal have Rolaids available."
