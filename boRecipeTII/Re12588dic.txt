Yogurt Cake (Hallgarten)
Yogurt, Sugar, Eggs, Vanilla extract, Vegetable oil, Flour, Baking Powder, 
Mix everything together well. Beat until smooth. Turn the mixture into a  well greased round cake pan measuring approximately 20cm/8in. Bake at 180C  / 350F / Gas4 for 45 minutes. Insert a knife to test and cook a little  longer if necessary.    This is a good basic recipe with many variations. You can make an  upside-down fruit cake by sprinkling the bottom of the pan with brown sugar  and laying sliced apples, pears or canned pineapple on the sugar, cover  with the cake mixture and bake as directed. Or add some mixed fruit to the  mixture before baking, or some chopped walnuts.    REFs >COOKING WITH YOGURT, by Hallgarten (1985). Hardcover. Chartwell  Books.
