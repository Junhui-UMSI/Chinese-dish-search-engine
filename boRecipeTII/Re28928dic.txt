COMBINE CURRY POWDER, turmeric, palm sugar, fish sauce, lime juice and oil.  Toss pork strips with marinade. Thread 3 or 4 pork strips onto the skewers,  weaving in-and-out, sideways, in a ribbon fashion. Marinate for 30 minutes  or longer. Preheat grill. Brush strips with thick coconut cream. Place  (brushed side down) over hot coals for 1 to 2 minutes or until charred and  cooked. Turn over, brush with coconut cream and grill until cooked. Serve  with Spicy Peanut Sauce (See RECIPE).    TO PREPARE COCONUT MILK AND CREAM: Pour 1 can unsweetened coconut milk into  a tall glass. Allow to sit for at least 1 hour so the thick cream rises to  the top. Skim off top (cream) and set aside. The rest is thin coconut milk.
