Cook about 1 1/2 c. barley in salted water till its done but still  slightly chewy. Drain if theres liquid left. (The liquid will be  appreciated by your pet on h/is dry food.)    Peel and dice One very large (12") or two average (6") eggplants, One  medium-sized butternut squash, seeds and goo removed and One small onion,  minced fine.  Cook veggies till tender in barely enough salted water to do  the job (not quite enough to cover) with About 1 rounded tsp. basil.    When done, add remaining ingredients.  Cook a few more minutes to thicken  and (if necessary) reduce sauce, stirring frequently.  Salt to taste and  serve over barley.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #246    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
