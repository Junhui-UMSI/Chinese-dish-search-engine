Grind the nuts with a special grinder until them become as flour. You will  have to have a special grinder for this.    Beat 8 yolks and 4 whites of eggs with sugar for about 1/2 hour, on speed  8.  While the eggs are beating, prepare the following ingredients. Grate  the bread. Prepare the rind and juice from the orange and the lemon; add  flavoring and allspice to the rind and juice, keeping bread separate.    When the egg yolks are ready, beat 4 egg whites, which you have reserved,  until stiff.  Now fold into the egg yolks all the ingredients, alternating  them.  Do this very gently, so tha tyou do not beat the air out. Grease a  14 x 10 inch pan heavily and flour it well. Bake at 325 F for about 1 hour.  Be sure to preheat your oven to the correct temperature before baking the  torta.  When torta is baked, cool for 10 to 15 minutes and turn out on  dish.  Either frost the cake or use powdered sugar on top as desired.  Serve.    Source: Cathy Arkovich "Our Favorite Recipes" St. Anthony Croatian Catholic  Church Typed for you by Karen Mintzias
