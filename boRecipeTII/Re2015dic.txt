A Salsa Cruda (Raw or Fresh Salsa)
Fresh ground cumin, habanero pepper, Serrano pepper, cilantro, Salt to taste, onion, roma tomato, Garlic, 
I use a molcajete for this, a blender can be substituted, not quite the  same, but nevertheless it can be done.    If you using a molcajete, first grind the chile,garlic,cumin, and onion if  used. The object being, to make a paste, a bit like a thai paste at this  point Add the tomato and grind to a paste or (sauce?) depends on the  tomatos you use.(at times I add a little water, if it too thick) add salt  and cilantro to taste.    I eat this with anything I can scoop it up with. corn tortillas deep fried  until crisp, flour tortilla torn, and made into handy little scoops, corn  chips, potato chips. It doesnt matter as long as I can get it to the old  face hole. Very tasty on a taco or over an egg in the morning.    Wake you up it will.    This is best when fresh, dont keep it over a day in the frig.
