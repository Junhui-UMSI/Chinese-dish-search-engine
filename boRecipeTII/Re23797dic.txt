Prepare the prawns by cutting off whiskers, cutting along the top of the  shell, and deveining them.  Leave the shells on the prawns because this  keeps the prawns more tender, tasty and plump. Wash, drain and put prawns  in a pie pan so as to be ready for steaming.    Wash black beans two times and mash into a paste; then add the chopped  garlic.    Combine remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the oil. Pour mixture over prawns;  then, pour oil on top. Cover and steam 10 minutes.  Serve over rice.    SOURCE: Chopstick, Cleaver and Wok.
