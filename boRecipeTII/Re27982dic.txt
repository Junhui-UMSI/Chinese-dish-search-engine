Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Celebrations: Holiday Brunch: Celebrations is a class that shows you how to  have a dining event that not only tastes good and looks good but is  generally enjoyable. Fitting with the holiday season, we worked on a  holiday brunch. Aside from these recipes, we learned about table  presentation, planning and tricks to make the event memorable. We also  created several types of food related decorations.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Have on hand three 10-inch skillets.    Whip together eggs, creme fraiche, potatoes and cheese. Keep chilled.    Place ingredients for Vegetable Frittata, Shrimp Frittata and Tomato/Basil  Frittata in the three non-stick saute pans. Add in 2 cups of egg-potato  mixture or enough to fill each pan half way.    Bake for 10-20 minutes until set in the center. Cool slightly and slice.  Serve warm.    Neat Serving Idea: To make individual Frittatas, bake in lined muffin tins.
