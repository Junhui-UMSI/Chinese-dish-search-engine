Pressed Duck with Sweet and Sour Plum Sauce
Water chestnut powder, Long Island duck, cleaned, Boiling water, Sweet and sour plum sauce, Oil for deep frying, Salt, Crushed toasted almonds, Chinese five-spice powder, 
Place duck in large kettle or Dutch oven with enough boiling water to  cover.  Add spices and salt and simmer covered until tender, about 1 to 1  1/4 hours. Remove duck from liquid and let cool.      Remove meat from bones and discard skin.  Pour chestnut powder into  small baking pan (an 8-inch aluminum pan works well; powder should be 1/2  to 1/4 inch deep). Press meat into powder. Cover and steam 30 minutes, or  until powder has gelatinized into thick, heavy crust. Remove from steamer  and let cool.    Cover and chill until ready to complete.      About 30 minutes before  serving time, prepare sweet and sour plum sauce; set aside and keep warm.  Warm a serving platter in low oven. Preheat oil in deep fryer to 375 F.  Slice duck into bite-size chunks and fry quickly in batches until crisp and  browned.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat until  cooking is completed. Serve immediately with sweet and sour plum sauce  topped with nuts. From Bon Appetits "Oriental Favorites."
