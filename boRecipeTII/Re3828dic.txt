Recipe by: Betty Shaw, Santee, CA Cut a hole in the top of the bread loaf 5  inches in diameter. If you wish, make a zigzag pattern to be decorative.  Remove soft bread from cut portion and discard. Reserve crust to make top  for loaf.  Scoop out most of the soft inside portion of the loaf and save  for other purposes, such as stuffing, dried bread crumbs, or feeding the  birds. In about 2 tablespoons butter, saute green onions and half the  garlic until onions wilt. DO NOT BURN! Cut cream cheese into small chunks  and add along with onions, garlic, sour cream, and Cheddar cheese. Mix  well.  Fold in artichoke hearts. Put all of this mixture into hollwed out  bread.  Place top on bread and wrap in a double thickness of heavy-duty  aluminum foil. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Slice French  rools thinly and butter with remaining butter and garlic. Wrap in foil and  bake with big loaf for the last 1/2 hours. When ready, remove foil and  serve, using slices of French rolls to dip out sauce. Makes enough for  about 10 to 12 as an appetizer. Note: The best part of this recipe is when  all the dip is gone and all that is left is the bread which is soaked in  all those delicious ingredients. Just break the bread up and it pass it  around!
