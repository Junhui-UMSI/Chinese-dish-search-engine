Applescotch Pie
Lemon juice, All-purpose flour, Salt, Butter or margarine, Pie crust shells (9");, Brown sugar; firmly packed, Water, Vanilla, Apples (tart); (note below), Granulated sugar, 
Mix together the apples, brown sugar water and lemon juice in a 2-quart  saucepan. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer 7-8 minutes or  JUST until apples are tender.    Mix together the flour, granulated sugar and salt; stir into apple mixture.  Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir  1 minute; remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla and butter or margarine;  cool.    Preheat oven to 425-degrees. Prepare pastry (or use store-bought). Turn  apple mixture into pastry-lined pie plate. Cover with top crust in which  youve cut slits; flute the edges. Cover edge of pie crust with foil (or  cut out an aluminum pan--keeping just the edge) to prevent excessive  browning; remove foil during the last 15 minutes of baking. Bake 40-45  minutes or until crust is golden brown.    Note: Ive found that ANY recipe calling for tart apples, you get more  flavor by mixing the types of apples. As we have an abundance of varied  apples,    Fujis, Granny Smith and Galas...they all vary in flavor, texture, etc.  Experiment with your favorite
