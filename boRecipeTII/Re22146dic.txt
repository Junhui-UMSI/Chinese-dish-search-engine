Turkey or Chicken Croquettes
Salt and pepper, Eggs, Heavy cream, Leftover turkey, Bread crumbs, Butter, onion, Flour, 
Combine the chopped turkey or chicken with the onion and seasonings. Melt  the butter, stir in the flour, and add this to the cream over a low flame  before combining the two mixtures.  Chill, forming little croquet shapes,  roll in egg and then bread crumbs, and fry.    Serve this with rice, leftover giblet gravy and a fresh green salad. Fresh  fruit for dessert.
