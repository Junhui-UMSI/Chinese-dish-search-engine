The Tamaaraa (Tahitian)
Text Only, 
The tamaaraa comes of course after the ahimaa.  It is the meal at  which one eats what has been cooked in the ahimaa, together with the  traditional raw fish, raw and cooked freshwater shrimps, raw and  cooked crayfish, the maoa [turbot] and the pahua taioro [clam  marinated in juice of grated coconuts, seawater and shrimps], the  maoa or pahua with rea [ginger], the miti [salt] hue [calabash],  the miti haari [coconut or coconut milk], the popoi [manioca or  breadfruit paste], and of course the famous fafaru [fish marinated in  seawater], the smell of which is always a little shocking to an  outsider.  The usual drinks are beer, punch, red wine and water. Both  for the preparations of the ahimaa and for serving the tamaaraa,  the Tahitians use traditional bowls, the umete made of wood. Some are  beautifully decorated and are used to prepare the poe [starch and  stewed fruit preserve], the marinated raw fish, etc...    Other kitchen utensils are; the penu or pestle, made in stone or  coral; the hue or calabash, used to keep the mite hue or fafaru; the  ana or coconut scraper++though nowadays metal-pointed scrapers have  replaced the traditional coral instrument, now only found in  old-fashioned households.    The tamaaraa is not just a meal.  It has all the characteristics of  a feast in the country and no effort is spared to make the table and  the surroundings as colorful as possible, with plants, fruits and  flowers.    Each guest is received with great attention and is crowned with  flowers; the tiare tahiti, the tipanie, the fara [pandanus]. On the  ground or on a table covered with banana leaves (green niau [coconut  palms]) the crockery is laid out; umete, hue, bamboo cups, green  coconuts and split emptied coconut shells.  Tradition demands that  the maa [food] tahiti be eaten with the fingers and therefore no  cutlery is laid out.    A tamaaraa is always a happy occasion.  The family meets, friends  come together, and everyone is gay.  There is music of course,  because in Polynesia a meal starts and ends with singing.  A small  orchestra is improvised (all Tahitians are amateur musicians) with  guitars, ukelele and bass.  (This bass is a unique instrument; it is  built with a 20 litre oil-drum, a broomstick an a string tying one to  the other, and the sounds are obtained by plucking the string.)  Punch, beer and red wine contribute to the gaiety.    From "Tahitian Cooking", Michel Swartvagher and Michel Folco. le  editions du pacifique, Papeete-Tahiti, 1980.  ISBN 2-85700-062-6.
