The combination of red wine and raspberries is so stupendous that we always  drizzle a little extra wine on top of each scoop. A generous shot of  Chianti over raspberry sorbet creates a truly synergistic effect.    1. Combine the raspberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl.  Refrigerate covered at least 1 hour.    2. When ready to freeze, add the red wine, corn syrup, and water and stir  gently until blended.    3. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze following the  manufacturers instructions. Makes 1 quart.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
