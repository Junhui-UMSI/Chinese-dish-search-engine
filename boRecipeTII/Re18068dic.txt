Heat remaining oil in another skillet; cook and stir pinto beans, 1 clove  garlic and 1/2 cup onion into oil. Add olives, dash salt, 1 tsp chili  powder. Add some of the sauce mixture if beans are too thick.     Assemble echiladas by filling tortillas with 2-3 tbs bean mixture. Place  mixture on one edge of tortilla, not in center.
