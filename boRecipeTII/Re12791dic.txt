My wife cooked this for me last week  and I found it almost too hot to eat. Since I eat hot chili/curry style  food two or three meals a day it may be an idea for those less acclimated  to the food to either reduce the amount of chili, or reduce the marinade  time (it can be reduced to zero - simply pour the sauce over the meat and  serve).    Take a pork steak or similar cut of meat (about a pound in weight), and  barbeque or grill it to the desired degree of done-ness.    Take a cup of prik ki nu daeng (fresh red birdseye chilis), and roast  them in a moderate oven (or grill them), until the skin begins to change  colour (we do this in a hot air "turbo" roaster - but any suitable oven or  roaster will do).    Grind the chilis to a pulp and add equal parts of tamarind juice and fish  sauce until the whole forms a slightly fluid paste.    Cut the pork diagonally across the grain into eigth inch thick slices, and  cut the slices into 1" long pieces and then toss with the sauce and allow  to marinade for about 24 hours.    Add 1 cup of very thinly sliced onions and two tablespoons of freshly  grated root ginger, and half a cup of chopped coriander leaves.    Toss (as a salad is tossed) and serve on a bed of lettuce with a bowl of  sticky rice (if not available ordinary steamed white rice will do).
