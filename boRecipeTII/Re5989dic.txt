Pita Bread (Kmaj)
Flour (white or whole wheat), Sugar, Active dry yeast, Salt, NORMA WRENN NPXR56B, Lukewarm water, 
Place water and sugar in large bowl and stir. Add yeast and stir slightly.  Let rest for 5 minutes.    Mix in salt and flour gradually, starting with 3-1/2 cups flour then adding  the rest. More or less water may be required, depending on the brand of the  flour. Use enough flour to prevent dough from clinging to bowl. Knead well  for 5 minutes. Place a little vegetable oil on palms of hands and smooth  all over to prevent crusting. Cover with plastic sheet then tea towel and  allow to rest for 20-30 minutes.    Set oven at 500 degrees. Divide dough into 8 balls. Roll out each ball into  1/4 inch thickness. Let rest covered for 20 minutes on generously floured  table or counter top. Bake on greased cookie sheets for 5-8 minutes or  until lightly browned. The higher the oven temperature the better the  results. May be kept in plastic bag in the refrigerator for several days or  may be frozen. To warm Pita, place the round on the rack in the oven at 300  degrees for 1-2 minute. This bread adapts very well to any type of food. It  is served with every Lebanese meal. Tear bite-size piece from the Pita  round, and use it to pick up morsels of food from the plate.
