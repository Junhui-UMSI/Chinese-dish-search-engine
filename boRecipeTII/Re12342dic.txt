Zucchini Shreds with Ginger
Zucchini, cut into, Vegetable oil, Salt to taste, Lemon juice, Coriander (fresh),, Cumin, whole, Ginger, shredded, Green chili peppers,, Tomato (ripe),, 
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat for 3 minutes. Add the  cumin, let the oil darken slightly (about 10 seconds) and add ginger and  chili.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring frequently.    Add the zucchini and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes.  Add tomato during the last        2    minutes of cooking.    Turn off the heat.  Sprinkle lemon juice and salt to taste, mix, transfer  to a serving plate and garnish with coriander.    NOTES:    *  Zucchini with ginger and chili peppers -- This is a nice spicy vegetable  dish.  It goes well with fish, especially catfish. Ive always used  zucchini, though it works as well with carrots or cucumbers. You can serve  it as an appetizer or as a side dish, hot or cold. The recipe is originally  from _Travel & Leisure_ magazine. Yield: Serves 4-6.    *  Ive found that this recipe works best if you use small zucchini, so  that each slice has some peel (skin?) attached. Center slices without  peel/skin fall apart.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  10 minutes.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Nancy Mintz  : UNIX System Development Lab      AT&T Information Systems, Summit, NJ  : ihnp4!attunix!nlm    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
