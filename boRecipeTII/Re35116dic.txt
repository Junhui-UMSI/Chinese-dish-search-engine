Beaumont Inn Kentucky Hot Brown
white bread, Salt and white pepper, Flour, milk, Butter, Swiss cheese, Bacon, Tomato, Cream, Turkey breast, <--Sauce-->, 
Recipe by: Beaumont Inn    Heat butter and add flour. Whisk and slowly cook for 5 minutes. Whisk in  cream and milk and heat. Whisk in cheese until melted. Season. Simmer for  30 minutes. Sauce should be very thick.    Quarter toast and place in an oven safe dish. Top with turkey and tomatoes.  Cover well with sauce. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Garnish with  bacon.    Note: This is a regional favorite that originated at Louisvilles Brown  Hotel earlier in this century. Many variations can be found, most commonly  country ham is added and a cheddar sauce is substituted. This is our  version which I feel is closer to the original recipe. It is offered on our  lunch menu.    Entered for you by: Bill Webster  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #835 by Bill Webster <thelma@pipeline.com> on  Oct 10, 1997
