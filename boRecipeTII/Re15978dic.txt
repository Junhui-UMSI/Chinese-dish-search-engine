Cream butter or margarine. Add sugar and vanilla sugar little at a time.  Mix in egg-yolks. Mix almonds with baking powder and stir together with the  chocolate into the dough. Add rum and brandy. Beat the egg-whites until  stiff and stir carefully into the dough.    Fill the dough into a round baking-form covered with baking-paper (paper  that prevents sticking). Bake it in a preheated oven for about 60 minutes  at 175C    Let it cool down (or out?).    Whip cream until stiff and put onto the cooled cake. Pour egg liquer over  it.    Decorate the torte with some cream and sprinkel it with the chocolate  crumbs.    Cal altogether : 5539 (bet those are Kcal!) carbon hydrates: 287 g fat/  protein   : 429 / 103 g    The original recipe called for 2 envelopes of cream hardener. That stuff  helps to get the cream get hard more quickly and staying so longer.  Unfortunately I dont know what it consists of.
