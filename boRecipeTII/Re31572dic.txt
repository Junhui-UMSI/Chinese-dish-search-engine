Sweetheart Pie (Or Tarts)
(21 oz) strawberry pie, (3 oz) cream cheese;, Prepared graham cracker pie, Confectioners sugar, Cool Whip; thawed, 
I got this recipe from the Mini-page of our local newspaper, in the section  called "Kids Recipes." The filling doesnt set firmly, so you dont get  clean slices, so I usually do this in the prepared graham cracker tart  shells that you can buy in the local supermarket. And you know, this really  tastes good.    1. In medium bowl, mix cream cheese and confectioners sugar until smooth  and creamy.    2. Stir in whipped topping and pie filling. Mix well.    3. Spoon into pie shell or tart shells.    4. Refrigerate at least 4 hours before serving.    5. Top with cool whip before serving. For a garnish, use a couple of fresh  strawberry slices.    Notes: This is rich, but is is really good. There is just enough filling to  fill a package of (6, I believe?) tart shells that you buy already made.  You can freeze these, too....Just take them out of the freezer about 15  minutes before serving time to give them time to thaw. Other flavors of pie  filling can be used as well. If you use "cherry" pie filling, mix it with  an electric mixer to chop up the fruit before adding it to the filling.  Blueberry is also really good in this recipe.
