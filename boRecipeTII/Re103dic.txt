Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of oven, and heat to 425. Line a 9x13  inch pan with aluminum foil. Butter the foil with melted butter.    Place the chocolate and the butter in the top of a double boiler, over hot  water on medium heat.. Stir until all the chocolate and butter are melted.  Stir to mix. Remove from heat, and set aside.    In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs with the vanilla,  almond extract, salt, dry espresso powder, and sugar on high for 10  minutes. On low speed add the chocolate, and combine until just mixed. Add  the flour, and beat until mixed. Remove from mixer and stir in the nuts, if  using them,    Turn the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top.    Bake for 35 minutes, reversing the pan once during baking for even baking.  Cover the cake loosely with foil about half way into baking to prevent over  browning. At the end of 35 minutes the cake will be done. Do not test with  cake tester the cake will still be wet but it is done. Remove from oven and  let it cool until room temperature.    Cover the cake with a cookie sheet and invert. Remove the pan and the foil.  Cover with another cookie sheet, and invert again. This will leave the cake  right side up.    Cover and refrigerate the cake over night. Using a serrated knife, cut the  edges off of the cake, they will be very hard. Cut the cake into 32 large  brownies. Refrigerate until served.
