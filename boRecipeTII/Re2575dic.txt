Peachy Cream Cake
(15-16 oz.) sliced peaches, Container; (8 oz.) whipped, Box yellow cake mix, Container; (8 oz.) peach, 
(Source -- Newspaper or magazine some time ago)    Mix the cake according to directions BUT add 1/8 cup peach syrup to batter  and slice 1/2 of one can of peaches into bits and add to batter. Pour into  two (2) round (8 inch) cake pans. Bake according to the directions on the  cake mix box. Remove from oven and cool for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and  cool completely.    FROSTING: Mix 3/4 of the whipped cream with the remaining 1/2 can of  peaches, which is also cut into small bits. Top the first layer with  frosting. Place second layer on top and frost the top and all around the  cake. Decorate with remaining can of peaches.    Store in refrigerator:    NOTES: I use fat free/sugar free whipped topping and low fat yogurt in this  recipe and it does not change the flavor one iota. If peach yogurt is not  available, add 1-2 Tbsp peach preserves to plain or vanilla yogurt and you  will get the same if not better results.
