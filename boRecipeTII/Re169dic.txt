Cut kumquats lengthwise, and remove outer rind. Set rind aside.   Combine kumquat pulp, peeled lemons, and 2 cups water in a large Dutch oven; bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered, 45 minutes.   Thinly slice kumquat rinds; place in a large Dutch oven, and cover with water.  Bring mixture to a boil.   Boil, uncovered, 5 minutes; drain well, and set aside.   Press kumquat pulp mixture through a sieve or food mill.   Measure 4 1/2 cups of puree into Dutch oven; add sugar and cooked kumquat rind.   Bring to a full rolling boil; boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.   Add pectin, stirring until well blended.   Pour marmalade into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace; wipe jar rims.   Cover with metal lids; screw on bands.   Process marmalade in boiling-water bath 10 minutes.   Yield: 12 half pints.      NOTES : "Though small in size, theyre big on flavor.  Kumquats, the smallest of citrus fruits, taste like a tart cross between an orange and a lemon. Kumquats are available in the grocery store during the winter months-December, January, and February."
