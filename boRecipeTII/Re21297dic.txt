Unbaked Chocolate Cookies-Coconut Variety
Oatmeal, quick, Waxed paper, Margarine, Vanilla, milk, Sugar, Coconut flakes, Cocoa, 
Bring the first four ingredients to a full boil for one minute. Remove from  heat and add the other three ingredients. Drop them by Tablespoons on waxed  paper and chill. Dont be distressed if the first few teaspoons seem thin.  It will thicken *fast* as you continue to spoon out the cookies.    Ive also heard these called No Bake Chocolate Cookies and Bakeless  Chocolate Cookies.    formatted by Russell Fletcher cccwebauthor@bigfoot.com    Recipe by: unknown-from barbu@ccountry.net    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Russell J.
