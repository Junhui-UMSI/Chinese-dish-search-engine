Beef a la Mode
Garlic, Beef rump roast, carrot; celery, Butter, MARINADE, Tomato sauce, Dry Red Wine, Pepper, Salt, Dried thyme, Beef bouillon, 
Place roast in large bowl or bag with marinade. Cover and chill 1 day.  NOTE: Will turn a purpil color.    Remove from marinade. Pat dry with paper towels. Brown on all sides.    Place in crockpot. Strain marinade reserving vegetables. Add marinade to  meat. Saute vegetables until glazed and add to meat. Loosen pan drippings  with a little water and add to pot along with bouillon and tomato sauce.    Cover and cook on low 8 hours or until tender.    Transfer meat to carving board. Pour juices into saucepan. Boil until  reduced to two cups.    NOTES : I use broth instead of boulillon cubes to reduce sodium. Does get  an interesting shade of purpil before cooking.
