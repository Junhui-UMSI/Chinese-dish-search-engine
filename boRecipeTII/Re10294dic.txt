Cooks notes: If soup is too thick, add either more broth or water until  soup reaches desired consistency.    Many supermarkets now carry canned cannellini beans. Italian markets sell  them, too. But if you cant find them, substitute great Northern beans.    To prepare crostini, cut rustic bread into slices about 3/8-inch thick.  Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Brush both sides of each slice  lightly with olive oil. Broil the bread until it turns brown, about 1-1 1/2  minutes. Flip the slices and broil them until the second sides brown, 30-60  seconds. Watch bread carefully, because it can burn easily, especially if  it is stale.    1. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil on medium-high heat. Add  Canadian bacon, onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until  onions soften and start to brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium  and add garlic; cook 1 minute.    2. Add broth and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil. Add pasta and  herbs; boil 8 minutes.    3. Meanwhile, place half of the beans in a food processor fitted with the  metal blade. Process until pureed. Remove soup from heat. Add remaining  whole beans and the bean puree to the soup; stir to combine.    4. Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper.    Presentation: Ladle soup into 5 bowls. Top with crostini and, if desired, a  little chopped parsley. Serve immediately.
