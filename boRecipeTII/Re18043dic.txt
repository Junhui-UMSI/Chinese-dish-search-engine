Veggie Baguette
Purple onion, 1/4 inch thick, Yellow squash 6-8 inch, Fresh baguette, 12 inch size, Ff or lf mayo, optional, Zucchini 6-8 inch, Part-skim mozzarella, Red bell pepper, Olive oil, or olive oil, Basil, fresh or dried,, 
(2 servings-adjust as necessary)    Slice both squashes lengthwise, about 1/4 inch thick. Cut pepper in half,  and remove seeds. On a large cookie sheet, lay slices of squash and onion,  and lay peppers skin side up. Brush all but peppers lightly with olive oil  or use olive oil spray, and place under broiler. (Our broiler is not very  hot, so it took about 5 minutes before the peppers started to char-your  time may be different) Leave veggies until peppers char-remove peppers and  place in paper bag, or heavy plastic bag and close bag to steam peppers.  Turn rest of veggies over, respray or rebrush if desired, and broil another  2 minutes or so, until veggies are tender, but not cooked beyond  recognition.    In the meantime, cut baguette into halves, and slice each half lengthwise.  On bottom half, place one tb cheese. On top half, smear a tsp of mayo and  sprinkle with basil if desired. When peppers have steamed 5 minutes, remove  from bag, and remove skin. Cut halves one more time to make quarters. Layer  veggies on each sandwich over the cheese. You will probably have too much  for just the two sandwiches, but we ate the extras on the side. Posted to  Digest eat-lf.v097.n166 by Nicki Eger <eger@sled.gsfc.nasa.gov> on Jun 30,  1997
