Alfredos Bbq Fish Marinade
Vinegar, Vegetable oil, Pepper, Garlic, Soy sauce, Lime juice, Salt, Sesame seeds, 
submitted by: brendad@corp.cirrus.com  This one is from San Jose, California, USA. My husband enjoys fishing.  While on a fishing trip for Dorado (Mahi Mahi) to the Gulf of California,  Sea of Cortez, he picked up this recipe from one of the local fishing  guides.    Mix all the above ingredients in deep dish. Marinate fish for one hour  before grilling.    Tastes very good on fresh Mahi Mahi or Ahi Tuna. Depending on your  preference you can cut back on the salt. I prefer to cut back on the salt  by at least half or not add it to the recipe. Try it full strength at least  once, then decide.
