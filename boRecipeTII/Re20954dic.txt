First make the cinnamon butter. Beat all the ingredients together  until the mixture is smooth. Store in a covered container in the  refrigerator until serving. (This keeps for 7-10 days.)    Sift the flour, baking powder, sugar and cinnamon into a bowl. Beat  in the melted butter, beaten eggs and milk. Grate the apples into the  mixture and mix in well.    Oil a griddle, or a heavy-basedfrylng pan, or an electric hotplate,  or if you have an Aga or Rayburn, the cooler hotplate. (For my  American readers an Aga is a constantly burning range-like cooker  with two or four ovens and hotplates. It gives an even heat and very  consistent results.) Drop spoonsful of the apple batter on to the  oiled surface, making pancakes of 2-3 inches / 5-7-5cm in diameter  and leaving a space between them. Cook for about 2 minutes or until  small bubbles appear over the surface, then, with a palette knife  (pancake turner), slip each over to cook on the other side.    As they cook, remove the pancakes and keep them warm on a plate, and  covered with a cloth. When all the pancakes are cooked, serve them  hot with the cinnamon butter.
