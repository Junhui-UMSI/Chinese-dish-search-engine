My mom developed a really wonderful cake recipe 20 or so years ago that Id  like to share with you all. I believe she entered it in a bake-off contest.  Since then it has been published in "The Baptist Book Store Cookbook" which  came out in 1980.    This is a terrific cake and I once made it to take to a party where I  really wanted to impress a group of people and "knock their socks off".  This cake did the trick. Here it is:    by Thelma Quinton, Chattanooga, Tennessee    Generously greas and lightly flour a 10-inch tube pan. (It must be a tube  or Bundt pan, a layer cake pan will *not* work.) Blend cake mix, eggs,  water and oil in large mixer bowl at low speed until moistened. Beat 2  minutes at high speed. In a small bowl stir together by hand until  thoroughly blended, one cup marshmallow creme and the peanut butter. Pour  batter into prepared pan. Spoon peanut butter mixture on top in a circle in  the center of batter. Do not allow to touch sides of pan or tube. Bake at  350 about 45 minutes or until it springs back when touched lightly in  center. Cool 25 minutes in pan; then remove and finish cooling right side  up on a cake rack. When completely cooled, frost with the following  frosting.    In top of double boiler combine chocolate chips and milk and heat over  boiling water until chocolate melts, stirring occasionally. Remove from  heat and stir in vanilla and the rest of the jar of marshmallow creme until  thoroughly blended. Cook until stiff enough to spread. Spread over top and  sides of cake. Sprinkle peanuts thickly on top of cake and press gently  into frosting. Posted to bakery-shoppe digest V1 Number 019 by Sandra  Swinford <sswinfor@cecasun.utc.edu> on Apr 10, 1997
