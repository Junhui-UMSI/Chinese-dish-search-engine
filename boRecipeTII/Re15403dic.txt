* Chili powder was not in original recipe, but we thought it was needed.    ** I think just 1/2 cup might be enough of this.    Cut the chicken in cubes, just slightly larger than the size of the beans.    Heat oil and garlic over medium flame until garlic speaks. Add cubed  chicken and saute 5 min until chicken is almost cooked through. Add celery  and onion and saute an additional 6-10 min or until onion becomes  translucent. Add broth and beans. Stir in chili powder, 1T cumin, white  pepper, salt, and half of the chopped cilantro. Bring to a boil, reduce  heat and simmer, uncovered, on low.    In a food processor or blender, combine remaining cilantro, 2 tsp cumin,  allspice, sour cream and chopped green onions. Blend. Sour cream will turn  a light green color. Server chili up in bowls and garnish with a dollop of  the sour cream mixture and a little extra slivered green onion. Pass  tortilla chips for dipping. [We sliced corn tortillas into strips and added  those to the chili.]    Recipe by: Adapted from a recipe found somewhere on the Web    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Kaye Sykes <kaye_sykes@NL.COMPUWARE.COM> on Dec  11, 1997
