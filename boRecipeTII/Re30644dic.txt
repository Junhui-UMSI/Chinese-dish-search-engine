prepare spices and then sautee carrots in vinegar or whatever you usually  use, along with the spices.  add the jalapeno and the beans, stirring and  cooking about 3 min, then add salsa and reduce heat to a simmer. while the  bean mixture is simmering, bring 2c water to boil with dash of salt. a  little at a time, sprinkle the corn meal into the boiling water, stirring  constantly to avoid lumps.  continue sprinkling and stirring until you have  a thick porridge resembling grits or cream of wheat (ymmv with the amount  of corn meal this takes -- dont force all the corn meal into the batter if  it looks done with less). remove batter from heat and stir in chili powder.  the bean mixture should be just about cooked now -- if carrots are tender,  remove bean mixture from heat.    spread 1/2 the corn meal mixture into the bottom of a large loaf pan or  small baking dish. spread all of the bean mixture (or as much as reaonably  fits in your pan) onto the corn batter.  top with remaining half of the  batter, kind of like a top and bottom crust. bake at 400 f for 30 min or  until the top corn meal batter is pretty firmly set.    garnish, if desired, with fresh tomatoes, cilantro, scallions, hot sauce,  etc.    Posted by Libby <eac9m@poe.acc.virginia.edu> to the Fatfree Dig.
