ANZAC day is celebrated in Australia on April 25.  On this day in 1915, the  ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) landed at Gallipoli, and  suffered the worst defeat in Australian military history. The fallen  soldiers of all wars are now commemorated on ANZAC day. Another cookbook  stated that these cookies were sold to raise money to help returned  veterans.    In saucepan place butter, treacle, soda, sugar and mix with boiling water.  Bring slowly to boil, remove and add dry ingredients. Mix well. Place  spoonfuls about 3 inches apart on well greased cookie tray. Bake at 275F  about 25 min.
