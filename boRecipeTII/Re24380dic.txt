HSF - Health Food Store Recipe from: The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever,  Madge Rosenberg    * The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg loaf and  1 T vegetable oil for the sm loaf.    Triticale is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye. You can  find it in most health food stores.  It adds to the taste but not much to  the rising of bread.  In combination with wheat flour, it makes good bread  for sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but unobtrusive flavor.    Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual and  process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturers  directions.
