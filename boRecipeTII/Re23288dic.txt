Mix all other ingredients into the bowl and adjust fluids  to taste and texture. (Texture should be soft enough to mold.)    I usually add a small can of chopped or sliced black olives, drained.  I  usually serve it as a salad over a salad mix of red and green leaf lettuce  or romaine with some chopped roma tomatoes. Also great with red onion,  thinly sliced. It is an ideal tuna mix to make in the morning and let it  chill until you get home for dinner!    EAT-L DIGEST 17 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
