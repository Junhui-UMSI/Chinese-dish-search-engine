For the crust, combine the flour with the sugar and salt in a food  processor. Scatter the cheese over the flour. Cut the butter, lard and  shortening into small pieces, and add them. Process briefly, until a  crumbly meal forms. (Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a bowl with  a pastry blender.) Pour in the smaller amount of water, and process or  blend until the dough holds together, adding the extra water if needed.  Divide the dough into two balls. Wrap these in plastic, and refrigerate  them for at least 30 minutes and as long as 24 hours.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    Combine the apples with the smaller amount of brown sugar, adding the rest  if they taste overly tart. Mix in the remaining ingredients.    Roll out both balls of refrigerated dough on a floured surface. Place one  in the bottom of whichever size pie pan you=re using, add the filling, and  top with the second crust. Crimp the edges and prick a few holes in the top  to allow the steam to escape. Bake the pie for 50 to 55 minutes, until the  crust seems well set and lightly browned. Check it after 25 to 30 minutes,  covering the edges with foil if they appear to be browning too rapidly.  Serve the pie warm or at room temperature.    Yield: 1 10-inch pie or a 9-inch deep-dish pie    Recipe by: DEAN FEARING SHOW #HE1A09    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #786 by Sue <suechef@sover.net> on Sep 17,  1997
