1. In a bowl, mix pretzels, butter and 3 T sugar. Spread evenly in a 9x13  pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes. Set aside and let cool.    2. Cream together cream cheese and 1 cup sugar. Slowly fold in Cool Whip.  Spread evenly over the cooled pretzel crust. Be sure to cover all the  corners and leave no gaps (the Jello will seep through and make the crust  soggy).    3. Stir together frozen strawberries, Jello and boiling water. Let set for  a little while, then carefully pour over the cream layer.    4. Let set for four hours in the refrigerator.
