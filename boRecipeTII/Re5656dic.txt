Cream together granulated sugar and 1/2 cup butter at  medium speed in mixer bowl until smooth. Lower speed; add vanilla, nutmeg,  eggs, yolks and milk. Mix until incorporated. Add baking powder and salt,  then flour and cornmeal. Mix until fluffy. Set aside. Combine remaining 1/4  cup butter, Madeira and pineapple in heavy, 10-inch oven-proof skillet over  medium heat and cook 20 minutes. Pineapple will release a lot of liquid.  Remove pineapple with slotted spoon and reserve.  Continue cooking until  liquid is reduced nearly to a glaze. Add brown sugar and cook until mixture  becomes smooth, about 2 minutes. Replace pineapple slices, arranging them  nicely in syrup. Pour cake batter over fruit. Bake on middle rack 20 to 25  minutes. When done, wooden pick inserted into center of cake will come out  clean. Place large platter over skillet and turn upside down to remove cake  from skillet. Let cool before serving.
