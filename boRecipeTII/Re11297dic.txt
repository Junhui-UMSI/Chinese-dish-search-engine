Ranch Apple Fried Pies
Lemon, Butter, Orange, apples, pastry, Sugar, 
Last month, Regelin came across a stash of cookbooks a client was giving  away, and as usual, picked out a few for my collection. Any profit Regelin  makes from her discoveries goes to the animal shelter, so for a small  donation, I acquired several volumes, including the "LBJ Barbecue Cook  Book," written by Walter Jetton, then caterer to the LBJ Ranch.    President Johnson likes these and so does just about everybody. It is the  all-time favorite of all the desserts I have ever fixed.    Cover apples, orange and lemon with water and cook over the fire for about  15 minutes - until they are tender. Remove from the heat and add the butter  and sugar, mixing well. Let the ranch apple mixture chill. Now roll out  your pastry and cut it in 4-inch circles. Add 2 tablespoons of the apple  mixture to each circle and fold it over. Press the edges together and fry  in deep fat until brown.    Posted to bbq-digest V5 #015    From: "Patrick Lehnherr" <plehnher@isd.net>    Date: Wed, 4 Sep 1996 14:24:42 -500
