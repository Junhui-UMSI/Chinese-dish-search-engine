1.  In a heavy pan, bring milk, water and salt to a boil. Turn heat to  simmer and gradually add polenta, stirring constantly. When polenta is  thick, turn heat very low, partrially cover and let simmer for about 2  hours, stirring occasionally. 2. Add the creamed corn, butter and cheese  and stir. The polenta should be very stiff. 3. Preheat oven to about 250  degree. Shape on an       oven-proof, well-buttered serving dish. (This can  all be done the day before. Just cover well and keep in fridge.) 4. ABOUT  AN HOUR BEFORE DINNER, take the polenta out of       the fridge......brush  it with egg yolk and sprinkle with the parmesan cheese. 5. Place in the  oven and bake for one hour. If it hasnt browned on the outside...stick  under broiler for a few minutes. Serve in the dish you baked it in. You can  buy polenta at the Supers that is much quicker to cook......and pretty  good.  Any leftovers get fried in butter for breakfast the next day.
