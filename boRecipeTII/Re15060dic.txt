Here are a few recipes that use ground beef.  I got most of them from a  cookbook called "country Ground Beef".  To order the cookbook, specify code  11608 and send $9.98 each plus 2.50 S & H to:  Country Store, Suite 3227,  5925 Country Lane, P.O. Box 990, Greendale, WI  53129.   This cookbook has  around 300 recipes with ground beef and they are wonderful. Brown beef;  drain.  Stir in tomatoes, rice, green pepper, onion, and seasonings; mix  well.  Cover and simmer about 30 mins.  Top with cheese; cook until cheese  melts.    Type 3:   Hamburger--30# of hamburger--tired of chili, hamburger patties,  meatloaf and spaghetti sauce.
