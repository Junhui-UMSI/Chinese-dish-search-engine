ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW #EE2267    Complete title: POACHED PEARS STUFFED WITH MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE AND ROASTED  WALNUTS WRAPPED IN PUFF PASTRY WITH PORT WINE REDUCTION SAUCE    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. For Port Wine Reduction: Combine the port with  the mirepoix and reduce by 2/3 to a syrup consistency (about 6-8 minutes)    For stuffed pears: Combine the blue cheese and walnuts together. Stuff each  pear with 1/4 of the mixture. Place a pear in the center of the halved puff  pastry sheet and wrap like a bundle, trimming any excess, thus leaving the  shape of the pear evident. Brush each pear with the egg wash and bake until  golden, about 8-10 minutes.    To assemble, place the pear in the center of the plate, drizzle with the  Port Wine Reduction, sprinkle with the walnuts and chives.
