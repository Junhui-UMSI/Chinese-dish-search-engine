Ancho Chile Puree
Dried chile Anchos, Hot water, 
Recipe By: Annie Somerville in "Fields of Greens"    Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Roast the chiles on an ungreased baking sheet  until they puff up and smell toasty, about 5 minutes.    Pull the chiles apart at the stem end and remove the stem (and the seeds,  if you so desire). Place the chiles in a small bowl and cover with hot  water, allowing them to soak for 15 to 20 minutes.    Place the chiles in a blender or food processor; add a small amount of the  soaking liquid and process to a smooth puree, adding more liquid if needed.  The puree will keep in the refrigerator for as long as several weeks.    Serving Ideas : Add to sauces for heat and a dark, almost musty flavor.    Ancho chiles are dried poblanos, available in Mexican speciality stores.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
