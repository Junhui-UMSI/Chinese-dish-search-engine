Water, Instant veg. stock powder, Dried dill or 1/8 tsp, Freshly ground bl pepper, Onions; coarsely, chopped, Cooked white beans or 1 15, (10-oz) Frozen chopped, Water, Salt, Freshly squeezed lemon juice, 
Heat the water in a medium saucepan. Saute the onions for 1 minute,  stirring frequently. Add the beans, spinach, water, stock powder, dill, and  salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and cook over medium heat  for 5 minutes.    Break up the block of spinach with a fork and stir well. Cook until the  spinach is tender, 3 tp 5 minutes. Puree the mixture in a blender.    If the creamed spinach seems too thick, thin slightly with lemon juice,  which will sharpen the flavors, or with water. Season with pepper to taste.  Depending upon the consistency, serve either in small bowls or on plates.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Susan Voisin" <voisin@axs2k.net> on Nov 13,  1998,
