In a large bowl let the pinto beans soak in enough water to cover them by 2  inches overnight and drain them, or quick-soak them and drain them. In a  large heavy kettle cook the onions and 4 of the garlic cloves, minced, in  the oil over moderate heat, stirring, until the onions are softened, add  the chili powder, the cumin, and the cayenne, and cook the mixture,  stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the beans and the water and simmer the  mixture, uncovered, adding more water if necessary to keep the beans barely  covered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beans are tender. Add the  broth, the tomatoes, the bell pepper, and the corn and simmer the mixture,  stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Add the bulgur and the zucchini and  simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the  zucchini is just tender. Stir in the remaining 2 garlic cloves, minced, the  Worcestershire sauce, the olives, and salt and pepper to taste, simmer the  chili for 5 minutes, and stir in the coriander. The chili may be frozen or  made 4 days in advance, cooled, uncovered, and kept covered and chilled.    Yield: 6 to 8 servings (12 cups)    NOTES : Cooking Live    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8806    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #387 by Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net>  on Jan 25, 1997.
