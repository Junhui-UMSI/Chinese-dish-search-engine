Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and saute the apples  for 4 to 5 minutes, turning frequently, until golden on both sides. Remove  from the heat and set aside.    Heat the oil in a clean skillet and saute the garlic, parsnips, onions, and  fennel seeds for 10 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sage, cider  or apple juice, and stock; bring to a boil, cover, and simmer gently for 12  minutes.    Add the apples and their juices to the pan and simmer for 3 minutes more.  Strain the juices into a small saucepan and keep the parsnip mixture warm  in a serving dish. Stir the mustard and honey into the pan, bring to a  boil, and simmer rapidly or 5 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced  slightly and glossy. Pour over the vegetables, season to taste with salt  and pepper, and serve at once.    * Source: The Inspired Vegetarian, by Louise Pickford * Typed for you by  Karen Mintzias
