Pumpkin Walnut Cheesecake
Brown sugar, Eggs, Butter, Zwieback crackers, crushed, Sugar, Cream cheese, softened, Walnuts, coarsely chopped, Heavy cream, Pumpkin pie spice, Butter, Brown sugar, Topping:, Pumpkin, 
Blend zwieback crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and the 6 tablespoons melted butter.  Press firmly over bottom and up sides of a lightly buttered 9-inch  spring-form pan. Chill. Beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the 3/4 cup  sugar and the 3/4 cup brown sugar, beating until well mixed. Beat in the  eggs one at a time, until mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in the pumpkin  pie spice and the heavy cream at low speed. Mix in the pumpkin. Pour into  prepared pan. Bake in a slow oven (325) for one hour and 35 minutes. While  pie is baking, mix the topping ingredients (the last 3 ingredients), first  the butter and brown sugar until crumbly, then blending in the nuts. After  the one hour and 35 minutes, remove the pie from the oven. Spread the  topping over it, and return it to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven  and cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight. This  cheesecake is rather large, and incredibly rich. Everyone always wants more  than they can fit in their stomach! And the recipe!  :-) Serving suggestion: Some like this garnished with whipped cream and  more walnuts, or with whipped cream and pecans.
