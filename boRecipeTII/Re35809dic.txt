Leave the skins on the eggplants, but trim off and discard the stems and  navels. Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise. Make slashes about 1 inch  deep in their flesh on the cut sides and sprinkle them with salt. Place the  halves cut sides down in a colander. Place the colander in the sink or over  a dish and let stand so the bitter liquid drains out of the seeds, about 40  minutes. Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 375 degrees F. Cover a baking sheet  with aluminum foil. Rinse the eggplant under cold water and pat dry  thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel. In a small bowl, mix together the  garlic, bread crumbs, oregano, parsley, the 1 tablespoon olive oil, and  olives. Using your fingers, work as much of the mixture as you can into the  slashes in the eggplant halves. Spread any remaining mixture on top of the  eggplants. Place the eggplant halves cut sides up on the foil-lined sheet  and drizzle generously with olive oil. Bake on the middle rack of the oven  until completely tender when pierced. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons chopped  fresh Italian parsley and then with salt and freshly milled black pepper.  Bake, uncovered, in an oven preheated to 400 degrees F until completely  tender when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room  temperature.
