Tea Smoking
Smoking, 
Line the bottom of a wok with foil having the foil extend several inches  past the rim. Empty several black tea bags into the bottom of the wok with  a tablespoon or so of brown sugar and mix. Place cooked chicken on rack in  wok and set heat on high. When mixture begins to smoke, place lid on wok  and overlap the foil on the lid to seal. Let smoke for 10 to 15 minutes  over high heat. The longer the smoking, the more intense the flavor. Remove  from heat and leave lid on till smoke subsides, about 15 minutes. I dont  care for beef or pork this way but I have used small chips of hickory,  mesquite, peach wood, or dried grape vines instead of the tea mixture with  good results!
