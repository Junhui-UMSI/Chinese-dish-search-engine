For the dough: Beat butter and sugar with the paddle on medium speed until  very soft and light. Beat in the vanilla and the yolk and continue beating  until smooth and shiny, about 3 more minutes. Stop the mixer, sift the cake  flour and add to the butter mixture. Pulse the mixer on and off to  incorporate the flour. Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic, wrap and  chill it until firm.    Roll the chilled cookie dough 1/8-inch thick on a floured surface. With a  floured fluted cutter, cut the dough into 24 disks. Line 24 tartelette pans  (2 1/2 inches with straight edges) with the disk of dough. Fill the  tartelettes with dried beans and bake at 325 degrees about 20 to 25  minutes, until pale golden. Remove beans and immediately invert the  tartelette and allow to cool. Remove from pans and arrange on a clean,  paper covered pan.    For the filling: Whisk jam and Framboise in a small bowl, fold in the  berries. Spoon the filling into each tartelette shell. Whip the cream with  the sugar until it holds its shape. Pipe a rosette of the whipped cream  onto each tartelette, using a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip.  Place a raspberry or two on each rosette.
