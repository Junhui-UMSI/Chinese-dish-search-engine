Austrian Bread Kugel
milk, Apples, Margarine, white bread, Eggs, Cinnamon, Sugar, Raisins, 
* (I NEVER used a fresh white bread and always adjusted the recipe relative  to the amount of challah I had left over!)    Soak the torn apart pieces of bread in the milk for ten minutes. Squeeze  the liquid from the bread and mix the bread in a bowl with the fruits,  spices and sugar. Add the beaten eggs and the left over milk and mix well.    Grease a baking pan.    Add the mixture to it. Cut 8 small slices of margarine and place on top of  the kugel. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon and sugar. Bake for 40 minutes  at a moderate temperature.
