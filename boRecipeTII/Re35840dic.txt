Source: Jewish cooking class taught by Bilha Widman    Soak the raisins in water for 10 minutes, then drain. Soak the bulgur in  water for 20 minutes, then drain and let dry well.    Separate the coriander leaves from the stems. Coarsely chop the coriander  leaves. (The stems are not used in this recipe.)    Add the coriander, raisins, olives, spices, lemon juice, and olive oil to  the bulgur. Mix well, and let stand for at least 1 hour.    Wash the figs. Cut the stem off, if necessary. At the stem end, make 2  crosswise cuts which dont go all the way through the fruit. The result  should be that the fruit is in quarters that are still attached.    Fill each fig with about teaspoonful of the filling. Serve and enjoy!  Notes: When I tasted the filling after preparing it I thought it wasnt  sweet enough, but the teacher assured me the figs were sweet, so the  filling didnt have to be sweet. She was right!    We ate these figs as an appetizer; Im sure they would also make a good  dessert (maybe then youd want to drizzle some honey over them?).
