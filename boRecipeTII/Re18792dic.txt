This is supposed to be the REAL Buffalo Wing recipe from the Anchor Bar in  Buffalo.    The Sauce This makes enough for about 30 "wingettes".   Mix all the  ingredients in a small sauce pan over low heat until the margarine is  completely melted.   Stir occasionally.      The Wings Fry the wings in a deep fryer set at 375 degrees F., using  vegetable or peanut oil. I fry 15 wings at a time for 12-15 minutes. Drain  the wings for a few minutes then put them in a bowl. After all the wings  have been fried, pour the sauce over them, cover the bowl, and shake to  completely coat the wings.   They can be eaten now, or you can put them on a  baking sheet and bake them for a few minutes to get an extra-crispy  coating. Serve with carrot and celery sticks, Maries Bleu Cheese Dressing,  and cold beer (Genee Cream Ale is traditional). ** (FRANKS, now Durkees)
