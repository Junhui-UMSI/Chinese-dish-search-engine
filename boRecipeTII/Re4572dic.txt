Petits Pois a la Francaise
Lettuce Heart, Heavy Cream, Water, Frozen Peas, Butter, Spring Onions, Salt and pepper, 
Shred the lettuce into little ribbons with a sharp knife. Clean and shred  the spring onions. Put the butter into a good solid pan with a lid. Add the  onions and lettuce. If using fresh peas, add them and about half a cup of  water and cook gently for about 10 minutes. If using frozen, let the spring  onions and lettuce cook on their own for about 7 or 8 minutes, then add the  peas and cook for a further 2 or 3 minutes. Dont add water there is enough  in the frozen peas already.    Pour in the double cream, balance the seasoning and bring to the boil, but  dont let it cook for more than a minute more. The peas will be green, firm  and surrounded in the most delicious and wicked sauce. Serve either with  plain grilled meat or as a dish on its own in little bowls with good bread.
