Zinfandel Pears
Sugar, Leaves, Pears, Bunch fresh basil -- plus, Zinfandel wine, 
1. Peel pears. Core pears by cutting a cone-shaped wedge from the bottom of  each. Leave stems intact. Discard seeds and cores. Wash and julienne a  bunch of basil.    2. Place wine and sugar in a medium non-aluminum saucepan. Add julienned  basil and bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Place pears  upright in poaching liquid, reduce heat, and simmer until pears are tender  and do not offer resistance when pierced with a sharp knife (about 20  minutes).    3. Remove fruit with a slotted spoon to a serving dish. Return syrup to a  boil and reduce by half to about 1 cup (about 10 minutes). Pour syrup over  pears and cool for 3 hours in refrigerator.    4. To serve, place pears in stemmed glasses, spooning some of the cooking  juices over each fruit. Garnish with basil leaves.
