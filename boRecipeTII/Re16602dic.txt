Aioli-Garlic Mayonnaise
Egg yolks, salt and pepper, Dijon mustard, Vegetable oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon juice, garlic, 
Have all the ingredients at room temperature. In a small bowl, beat the egg  yolks with the mustard, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and garlic to taste. Beat  in 1/4 cup vegetable oil, drop by drop. This will establish the emulsion.  The remaining vegetable oil and the extra virgin olive oil can then be  added in a slow steady stream while you continue to beat constantly. Adjust  seasoning with lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. If the mayonnaise  seems too thick, add a drop or two of water. Cover and refrigerate until  ready to serve.
