Walnut Chocolate Rum Balls
Cocoa powder, Rum, Walnuts, 
Combine nuts, sugar, and chocolate. Moisten with rum to form a stiff dough.  Form into small balls and roll in cocoa to coat. This recipe is not only  simple, its flexible. It can be made with other kinds of liquor (amaretto,  sherry, and Southern Comfort work well), nuts (almonds or pecans, for  instance) and coatings (ground nuts, finely grated coconut, etc.) and  always comes out tasting great. Adding small chunks of nut for texture is  also effective.
