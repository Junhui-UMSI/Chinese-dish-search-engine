Easy Kreplach
Cooked chicken, Onions, Schmaltz, Grivens; (if you have any), Salt, Pepper, Won ton skins, 
Source: Good Yom Tov - Helen Stern    Saute onion in smaltz. Place chicken in food processor. Add onions,  schmaltz and grivens to chicken. Add salt & pepper to taste. Chop well.    Place 1 teaspoon of meat filling in center of each won ton skin and fold  into triangles. Pinch sides together. It helps to moisten the edges so they  will form a better seal. Let stand on floured surface for 15 minutes to  prevent sticking or opening during cooking. Drop into boiling salted water  or soup. Cook about 15 minutes. Also good deep-fried.
