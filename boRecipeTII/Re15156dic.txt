Wheat Tortillas
Flour, Olive oil or other vegetable, Baking Powder, Water, Salt, 
Put flour into a bowl. Make a hole in the center and put in the baking  powder, salt and oil. Add a tablespoon or two of water and stir vigorously.  If the dough wont stick together add more water, by tablespoons. You dont  want the dough to become a batter.    Divide the dough into balls about as big as a tangerine. Roll or pat (or  use a tortilla press). If you havent got an electric press youll need to  put each tortilla on a hot grill just until lightly toasted on each side.    Cover with a cloth or slip into a heavy duty plastic bag to keep.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #221 by "Eeyore" <efalt@totacc.com> on Dec  1, 1997
