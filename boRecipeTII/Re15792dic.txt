About Freezing Blueberries
Help file, 
Blueberries freeze very well. Simply sort the fruit, dont wash, and pack  in freezer bags or boxes. When you use the frozen fruit, simply wash in  running water and use. Dont thaw. This is especially nice when adding  blueberries to fruit salad or muffins where you dont want the rest of the  product to turn purple. If youve already washed the berries, let them dry  before freezing. My favorite way to eat blueberries is "straight up."   For  breakfast try the berries in rice (brown, white, what ever) with a little  cinnamon and/or clove.    From: Rita=Schulte%TV%WILL~~at;bigbird.will.uiuc.edu.
