green onion, Eggs, Chinese red rice vinegar, Sesame oil, Lean boneless pork, Sesame oil, Double-strength chicken, Light soy sauce, Dried tigerlily buds, Bamboo shoots, Sugar, white pepper, Peanut oil, Dried Cloud Ear mushrooms, Dried Chinese black mushroom, Fresh bean curd, 
Pour boiling water over cloud ears, black mushrooms & tigerlily buds. Let  soak 15 minutes. Drain; cut off woody parts of mushrooms and hard tips of  buds, then slice very thinly. Set aside. Heat broth in a large saucepan.  Meanwhile, heat peanut & sesame oils in a wok or large skillet; when oil is  hot, sprinkle on soy sauce. Add pork or chicken and stir-fry just a few  minutes or until crisp on edges. Add mushrooms and tigerlily buds and stir  to brown edges lightly. Then add meat and mushroom mixture to broth and  stir well; stir in bean curd and bamboo shoots. When soup comes to a gentle  simmer, pour in beaten eggs, stirring soup with a swirling motion. As soon  as eggs start to cook, remove soup from heat. Rinse 4-6 individual soup  bowls or 1 large serving bowl with hot water. Then mix vinegar, green  onion, 2 tsp sesame oil and white pepper, Hot Hot Oil or Chile Oil. Divide  mixture equally among individual bowls or place all in a large bowl. Taste  soup and adjust seasonings, adding more soy sauce or perhaps a pinch of  sugar if a less sour flavor is desired. Stir to mix the cloudlike shreds of  egg evenly, then pour into individual bowls or serving bowl. To eat, bring  soup spoon up from the bottom of the bowl to mix hot and sour flavors into  each bite. Makes 4 to 6 servings.    From the <Hotter Than Hell!>, by Jane Butel, ISBN 0-89586-646-3  (0-89586-542-4 paperback).  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
