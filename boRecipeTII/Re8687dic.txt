Pouding Renverse des Bleuets    Lemon-flavoured cake batter baked over fresh blueberries makes a perfect  dessert. When I was immersed in French language studies at Jonqieres  Centre linguistique, Jeannine Renouf treated me to this recipe and also to  a version that she makes with wild raspberries. It was a delectable kind of  immersion.      Combine blueberries, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon rind in a buttered 8  inch square baking pan.    In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, cream  shortening with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in egg and  vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with milk, blending well after  each addition and finishing with dry ingredients.    Pour batter over fruit in pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for about  40 minutes, or until a tester inserted in centre comes out clean. Let cool  slightly; turn out onto serving plate. Cut in squares and serve warm or at  room temperature, with whipped or ice cream, if desired.
