Tomato Soup with Gin

From a web site of the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany (Source:  "Kochen rund ums Jahr", by Heidemarie Freund)    Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters, depending on size. (I peeled them  first.) Finely chop onions. Melt butter in a casserole add onions, season  with salt, thyme and rosemary. Fry onions until soft. Add tomatoes and fry  them together with the onions for another 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Add the bay leaf and the beef stock. With the lid closed let the soup  simmer at low heat for about 40 minutes. Then pass the soup through a sieve  or blend it in a mixer. (I put my small hand-held mixer into the casserole  and it worked well.) For a short moment, bring the soup to a boil again.  Then add salt and pepper to taste and pour the gin into the soup. Mix well.    Serve with a spoonful of whipped cream on each portion.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 22 Mar 97 by Antje Harder  <Antje_Harder@COMPUSERVE.COM> on Mar 23, 1997
