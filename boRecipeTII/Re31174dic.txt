From: lrellick@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Lorraine M Rellick)    Date: 17 Jan 1994 16:15:40 GMT    Heres the recipe for the banana walnut cake (its very easy and good!): Mix  everything in the same bowl (using a wisk to make smooth) Bake in a 9X13  inch pan (greased) at 350F for approx 35 minutes or until the top is brown  and springs back when touched. This cake is quite sweet and doesnt need  frosting. PS: to make sour milk (dont use old milk), put a tablespoon of  vinegar in a cup of milk)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
