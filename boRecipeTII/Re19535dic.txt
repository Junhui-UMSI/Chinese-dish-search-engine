Cream together butter and cream cheese.  Add sugar and beat until well  blended.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  (Mixture might look curdled.)  Add remaining ingredients; mix well.  Chill  dough 3 hours.  Divide soft dough in half.  On a 17 by 14 inch cookie  sheet, form each half of dough into a roll 1-1/2 inches wide and the  length of the cookie sheet.  Bake in 350 degree oven 30 to 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cut rolls into 3/4 inch slices.  Place on cookie  sheets, cut side down, return to oven and bake 10 minutes or until toasted  and crisp.  Makes about 48 slices.
