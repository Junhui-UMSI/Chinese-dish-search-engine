Careys Greek Tzatziki Sauce
Cucumbers, Salt, Yogurt, olive oil, Lemon juice, White pepper, Garlic, Mint leaves, fresh*, Sour cream, Cumin, Dill; fresh*, 
Preferably utilize FRESH Ingredients.  Use more or less garlic, minced, to  your preference. Peel, seed and dice cucumbers. Sprinkle with salt and set  aside to drain.  Combine yogurt, olive oil, fresh lemon juice, pepper and  garlic in large bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Just before serving, beat  yogurt sauce  until smooth. Have fresh mint torn into  small pieces. Dry cucumber by gently squeezing between paper towels.  Combine cucumbers with mint leaves and yogurt mixture. Add salt and pepper  to taste. You can see that I added 3 additional ingredients to improve upon a standard recipe that most use.. by combining sour cream with the yogurt and doing both the mint and dill along with cumin it makes an old favorite much better, the cumin alone completely enhances the taste. * Note;  this can be prepared and served either as is ( chunky) or throw all ingredients into a food processer or blender and puree to a smooth texture. ENJOY!!!
