TO MAKE THE STUFFED PORK TENDERLOIN: Preheat the oven to 425-degrees. Cut a  pocket in the side of the tenderloin by cutting a lengthwise slit from one  side to almost the other side and stopping about 1/2" from each of the  tapered ends. Set the tenderloin aside.    Finely shred the peel from the oranges and set aside. Then squeeze 3  tablespoons of juice from the oranges. In a medium bowl, combine the orange  juice and apples. Set the apple mixture aside.    Spray an unheated small skillet with no-stick spray. Add the onions. Cook  and stir over medium heat until tender. Then add the onions and bread  crumbs to the apple mixture. Toss until combined.    Spoon the bread mixture into the pocket of the tenderloin. Securely close  the pocket with wooden toothpicks. Place the tenderloin on a rack in a  shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into the meat portion only.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until meat thermometer registers 160-degrees.  Let stand about 5 minutes before slicing.    TO MAKE THE SAUCE: In a small saucepan, use wire whisk to stir together 2  tablespoons of the apple juice and cornstarch. Then stir in the remaining  apple juice.    Cook and stir over medium heat until boiling. Stir in the reserved orange  peel and cinnamon. Add the raisins and cook for 5 minutes, stirring  occasionally.    To serve, slice the tenderloin. Spoon the sauce over slices.    Calories: 245, Fat: 4g, % Calories from fat: 16%, Cholesterol: 74.
