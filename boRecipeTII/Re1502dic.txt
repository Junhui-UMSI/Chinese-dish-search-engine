Bread and Roses Split Pea Soup
Water; or vegetable stock, Carrots; cut in chunks, Sweet potatoes; cut in, olive oil, Onions; chopped, Stalk celery; sliced, Garlic cloves; diced, Salt, Pepper; to taste, Marjoram, Chopped parsley, Split peas; previously dried, Bay Leaves, Thyme, 
In large pot, combine split peas, bay leaves, and water/vegetable stock.  Bring to boil, skim foam, add thyme, cover and simmer 30 minutes. Add  carrots and sweet potatoes and continue to cook until tender about 20  minutes longer. Remove bay leaves. In a separate pan, heat oil until hot  and add onions. Saute until softened, about 3 minutes. Add celery and  minced garlic and saute until softened. Add contents of pan to soup pot.  Stir in marjoram and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer 5 minutes  longer to blend flavours. Garnish with parsley.    NOTES : Use quick-cooking split peas.  I use Loretta brand, which dont  require pre-soaking. I do still find that the peas take much longer than  the recipe instructions specified to be softened enough to form a suitable  mixture with the rest of the ingredients. I use dried thyme leaves, since  the recipe didnt specify fresh, dried, leaves, or ground. When it came  time to season with salt and pepper, I found the soup not sufficiently  seasoned, and ended up mixing in some bouillon cubes.
