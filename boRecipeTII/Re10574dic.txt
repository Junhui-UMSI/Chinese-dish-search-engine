Quick Monkey Bread
Pecans, Cinnamon, buttermilk biscuits, butter, Sugar, Brown sugar, 
Sprinkle pecans evenly in bottom of well-greased 10-inch bundt pan. Set  aside. Combine sugar and cinnamon. Cut biscuits into quarters; roll each  piece in sugar mixture and layer in pan. Combine brown sugar and butter,  pour over biscuit pieces. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes. Cool on  rack for 10 minutes. Turn out on plate. Be careful as caramel mixture is  very hot and sticky.    Note by Karen: I have made this before in the following manner: Use a  square or round baking dish. Roll WHOLE biscuits in sugar-cinn. mixture.  Place into dish. Sprinkle pecans over and between biscuits. Pour brown  sugar-melted butter mixture over biscuits. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes. Cool  on rack for 10 minutes. Invert onto plate. Also, it is not really necessary  to grease baking dish before hand. Cinnamon and sugar mixture can be  sprinkled in bottom of dish before adding biscuits and on top of biscuits,  instead of rolling biscuits in mixture. I also use more pecans, approx. 3/4  to 1 cup. This recipe is delicious.
