Pierce the meat with a fork "some"  (like poke it so the stuff can get in), turn it in the marinade, and let it  sit for a hour or so (at room temperature), or put it in the refridgerator  overnight.  Turn it a few times during the marinating.  Grill, Broil, or  Pan Fry "until done". Some like the marinade, heated in a pan to boiling,  over rice (not in this house, though).
