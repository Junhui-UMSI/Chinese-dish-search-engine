Caramelized Grilled Fruit
Unsalted butter, dark-brown sugar, peaches, red plums, bananas, 
1. Heat grill or broiler to medium-hot. In a large bowl, combine the melted  butter and brown sugar. Add all fruit and toss.    2. Fold the edges of a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil to form a shallow  baking pan, and place on grill. Arrange the fruit, cut-sides-down, on the  foil. Cook fruit until browned and caramelized around the edges,  rearranging occasionally to prevent burning. Turn the fruit over, and  repeat; serve.    kitpath@earthlink.net    Recipe by: Martha Stewart TV 1998    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by Pat Hanneman <kitpath@earthlink.net> on Sep  20, 1998,
