:    For the dough, mix flour, eggs, salt and water into a firm paste and  let stand 1 hour.  Roll dough out very thin and cut into 2 1/2" circles.    :    For the filling, mix meat, onion, salt and pepper together and add  enough water to make the filling juicy.    :    Smooth a little cold water half way around the edge of each circle,  and put a small mound of filling in the middle.  Fold over and seal the  edges firmly together.  Traditionalists then bring the corners together and  crimp them together to form a ball.  :    Carefully lower the pelmeny into boiling water, optionally flavored  with a couple of chicken bouillon cubes, and cook for 15 minutes.  :    Serve with soy sauce, sour cream and/or vinegar.  :    Source:  Recipes from the Russians of San Francisco by Margaret H.
