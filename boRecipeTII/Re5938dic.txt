Pistachio Ice Cream
Sugar, milk, Pistachio nuts., Whipping cream, Pure almond extract, Pure vanilla extract, Eggs, 
BLANCH  the nuts by placing in a bowl for one minute and pouring boiling  water over it (  the nuts should be out of the shells). Drain and peel.  BLEND the nuts, the milk, the eggs, and the sugar until you have a green  smooth liquid.  Pour into a saucepan. COOK over low heat until the custard  thickens, about 25 minutes or so. Do not boil or it will curdle. COOL. When  cool, add vanilla and almond extracts.  Stir. FOLD in whipped cream.    FREEZE in an ice cream maker or in a container or bowl in your freezer. If  you use the bowl in freezer method, you should pull the bowl out 2 or 3  times and mix the mixture with a mixer. The frozen custard on the sides of  the bowl should be moved into the rest of the mixture. This incorporates  air and breaks up ice crystals.    This ice cream takes a LOT of time, particularly considering that you have  to blanch the nuts.  If you dont mind lots of peel in your ice cream, you  can pass, but this makes a really unsavory ice cream.    If youve never had homemade ice cream before, you will be surprised at the  richer, tastier, smoother, and denser ice cream a homemade version will  give you. You will have to soften it before scooping it, as real ice cream  always requires.
