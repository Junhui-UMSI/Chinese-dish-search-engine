SALAD: Rinse the quinoa thoroughly in a bowl of cold water. Then pour into  a fine-mesh strainer and rinse again under running water. Bring 2 cups of  water to a boil, add salt, then stir in the quinoa. Lower the heat, cover  the pan and cook 15 minutes. Taste the grains--there should be just a  little resistance and the opaque, spiralled ring of germ should show. If  necessary, continue cooking until done, then pour into a strainer and set  aside to drain over a bowl. Toast the pine nuts in a dry pan over medium  heat until they are golden brown and set them aside. Make the salad  dressing and toss the warm quinoa with the fruits, vegetables, pine nuts  and dressing. Serve piled onto a platter.    SALAD DRESSING: Combine lemon zest, juice, spices, herbs and salt together  in a bowl. Stir to combine, then whisk in the olive oil. Taste and adjust  the balance of flavors, adding lemon juice if necessary. Serves 4,  generously.    DEBORAH MADISON - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
