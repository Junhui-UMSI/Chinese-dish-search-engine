This is the Apple Cream Cheese Coffee Cake recipe that I promised to repost  for you. I won the Grand Prize for this in November in the Vermont Apple  Bake-Off. Hope you like it. In a large bowl, combine flour and sugar; cut  in butter using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Remove 1 cup for topping. To the remaining crumb mixture, add baking  powder, soda, salt, sour cream, egg and vanilla; blend well. Spread batter  over the bottom and 2" up the side of a greased and floured 9" springform  pan (batter should be 1/4" thick on sides). For filling #1, in a small  bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice and egg; blend well and pour  over the batter in the pan. To make apple filling, mix all apple  ingredients together and carefully spoon over the cream cheese filling. In  a small bowl, combine reserved crumb mixture with the nuts and sprinkle  over the top. Bake at 350 degrees for 55-60 minutes or until cream cheese  filling is set and crust is a deep golden brown. Cool 15 minutes then  remove sides of pan. Cool completely and then drizzle with maple glaze if  desired. For maple glaze, mix all ingredients together.
