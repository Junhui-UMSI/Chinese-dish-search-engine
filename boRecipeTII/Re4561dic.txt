Petite Cherry Cheesecake
Cherry pie filling, Cream cheese, Vanilla, Eggs, Lemon juice, Vanilla wafers, Sugar, 
Beat cream cheese; sugar, eggs, lemon juice and vanilla until light and  fluffy. Line muffin tins with paper baking cups, and place a vanilla wafer  in the bottom of each. Fill each 2/3 full with the cream cheese mixture.  Bake at 375 degrees 15 to 20 minutes, or until set. Top each with about 1  tablespoonful of the pie filling.   I use different pie fillings, and sometimes more than one when making a  recipe, they look very nice on frilly paper doilies, with the different  colors of toppings. If you make marzipan, some green marzipan leaves look  pretty on top, and at times I have made some little chocolate doodle  figures to use with these. Barb Day
