Sugar, Eggs, milk, Lemon Rind, walnuts, LEMON SUGAR SYRUP, Lemon juice, Sugar, Flour, Baking Powder, Salt, Butter, 
1.  grease one loaf pan, dust lightly with flour.   2.  stir flour, baking  powder and salt onto wax paper.   3.  combine butter, sugar, and eggs. beat  until light and fluffy.   4.  stir flour mixture into batter alternately  with milk, beating after   each addition until batter is smooth.  Stir in  lemon rind, lemon juice,   and nuts.  Pour into loaf pan.   5.  bake in  moderate oven (350) degrees for 1 hour, or until center   springs back when  touched lightly with finger.   6.  cool cake in pan on wire rack for 10  minutes. loosen cake around   edges with knife, turn out on wire rack  placed over wax paper. brush lemon syrup on top and sides of cake slowly,  allowing time for cake to   absorb syrup.  cover loosely with aluminum  foil, let stand 24 hours before cutting. A shortcut to this method, is to  leave the cake in the pan, poke it all over with a sharp knife, and pour  syrup on cake. allow syrup to absorb for 24 hours. Lemon Sugar Syrup:  Combine lemon juice and sugar in a small bowl.  Sugar   does not have to be  dissolved.
