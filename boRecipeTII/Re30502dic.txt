In the skillet, cleaned, heat 3/4-inch of the additional  oil to 375F (190C) and in it fry the tortilla chips in batches for 30  seconds to 1 minute, or until most of the bubbling subsides.

On a large deep platter or in a large bowl arrange  the romaine, spoon the beef mixture over it, and arrange the tortilla  chips, tomatoes, Cheddar, and scallion decoratively over the salad.

Add the tomato, the jalapeno pepper, and the cilantro and  blend the vinaigrette until it is smooth.    Transfer the vinaigrette to a small bowl and serve it with the salad or  pour the vinaigrette over the salad and toss the salad until it is  combined.
