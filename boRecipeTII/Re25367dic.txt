Tortellini with Cream
Tortellini, Grated Parmesan, Heavy cream, Black Pepper, Butter, 
MELT THE BUTTER in a medium-size saucepan; add the heavy cream and heat  through. Cook the tortellini in boiling salted water, then drain them and  place them in a heated serving bowl. Pour the cream-butter mixture over  them and toss thoroughly so that some of the cream is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup  grated Parmesan cheese and a generous quantity of pepper, and toss again.  Pass additional cheese at table.
