Epinards Aux Pois Chiches (Spinach and Chickpeas)
Chickpeas; (250 grams), Tomatoes; peeled and chopped, Salt and pepper, Spinach; (750 grams), Onion; coarsely chopped, Sunflower oil, 
Fry the onion in the oil until soft, then add the drained chickpeas and the  tomatoes. Cover with water. Simmer 1 hour until the chickpeas are tender,  adding salt and pepper when they begin to soften and water if necessary,  letting it reduce when the chickpeas are done. Wash and drain the spinach  and squ`0eeze the water out (unless the stems are thick and hard you do not  need to remove them). Place on top of the chickpeas. Put the lid on, so  that the spinach is steam-cooked. As soon as the spinach flops (within  minutes), add a little salt and stir. Serve hot.    VARIATIONS:    ~ A Judeo-Spanish version called "espinakas kon avas" is with white haricot  beans instead of chickpeas. -A tablespoon of tomato paste may be used  instead of tomatoes.    NOTE: Ms. Roden states that this dish is often served in Sephardi  communities, especially during Rosh Hashanah. The chickpeas represent  "plenty and their roundness symbolizing that the year would be well  rounded, and the spinach representing newness."
