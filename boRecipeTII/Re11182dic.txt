Let  stand a few minutes until most of the milk is absorbed.    Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar into a medium-sized bowl. Stir  to mix well.  Add raisins and nuts; toss to mix. Add egg and oil to soaked  cereal and beat well with fork. Pour into flour mixture and stir only until  dry ingredients are moistened.  Batter will be lumpy.    Drop batter into prepared pans, filling each cup 2/3 full. Bake 15 minutes,  or until browned.  Remove from pan and serve immediately.
