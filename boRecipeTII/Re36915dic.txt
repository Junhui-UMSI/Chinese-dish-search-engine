Beat eggs until foamy. Combine with sour cream. Sift  flour. Add sugar and salt and sift again into a bowl.  Add liquid and beat  until smooth.    Divide among popover cups. Place on cookie sheet, and bake 15 minutes;  reduce heat to 350 and cook 20 minutes more. Divide the popovers in half  then cover with strawberry sauce. Serves six to 12. (These are big  popovers; you may think half is enough for a dessert portion or a whole one  would make a good breakfast).    Strawberry sauce: Hull strawberries and wash them. Combine sugar and  cornstarch in a saucepan and stir mix completely. Slice strawberries into  the saucepan and set aside for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the  liqueur and heat over medium flame until the mixture boils, stirring  occasionally. Remove from heat.    Serve over ice cream, sliced bananas, waffles, pancakes, popovers, with  angel food cake or pound cake, or spoon on top of cheesecake.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
