Portobello and Zucchini Sandwiches with Tomato Salsa (Mf)
Sliced pitted cured black, Tomato salsa, see recipe, Vinaigrette, Zucchini, cut in 1/4" thick, Robiolla or soft fresh, Green or black olivada, Portobello mushrooms, Snipped chives, for garnish, 
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Marinate the zucchini in vinaigrette for  10 minutes at least. Remove the portobello stems. Then, very carefully,  slice them in half horizontally so you end up with two 8 large rounds. Set  the rounds on a baking sheet and spread each round with some olivada and  about a tablespoon of cheese. Add the marinated zucchini strips to the  baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and zucchini  from the oven and assemble. Set a portobello round on the bottom of a  dinner plate and top with zucchini, cover with another portobello round and  cover with zucchini. Garnish the top and sides with tomato salsa, chives  and black olives slices.
