Baked Chicken Breasts - Crockpot (To Die For!!)
Chicken breast halves, boned, Butter, Cream of Celery soup,, Dry sherry, Tarragon or rosemary leaves,, Worcestershire Sauce, Garlic powder, mushrooms, 
Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in Crock-Pot. In a  saucepan,combine remaining ingredients and heat until smooth and hot. Pour  over chicken breasts. Cover and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours. (I did it on higher heat to speed things up. I added boiled potatoes and some  paprika towards the end.)   For the first time ever, I used those frozen  boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to  cook with canned soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this  recipe, you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is  delish!!!      Adapted by Brenda Adams    NOTES : I think this could be made in oven or on top of stove. Hint:  Rivals recipe called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the  quantity.  You could leave them out if you dont like mushrooms. I had no  Cream of Chicken soup and subd Cream of Celery. It was soooooo goooood  that I think Ill just stick with Celery in the future!
