Pesto is  a fresh herb sauce that is made from basil leaves, garalic, pine nuts,  grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and extra-virgin olive oil. White this sauce  is usually served with pasta or minestrone, it can also transform a loaf of  bread into a frangrant bouquet.  With a light crumb and crisp crust, pesto  bread is a natural companion to any Italian meal. Prepared pesto sauce is  popping up more and more in supermarket dairy cases along-side fresh pasta  and noodles.  If you should have any pesto left over, I suggest using it  within a few days or freezing it for later use. All ingredients must be at  room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Add ingredients in the order  specified in your bread machine owners manual. Set bread machine on the  basic/standard bread making setting. Select medium or normal baking cycle.  The programmable timer can be used, if desired.
