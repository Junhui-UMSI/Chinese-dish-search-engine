raspberries, Sugar, Unsalted butter, Light corn syrup, Dutch-process cocoa powder, Heavy cream, 
PUREE THE RASPBERRIES in a food processor fitted with a steel blade, then  pass them through a fine strainer. Or pass them through a food mill. Set  aside. In a medium-size heavy saucepan, whisk together the cocoa and heavy  cream. Add the butter, sugar, corn syrup and raspberries and stir until  well blended. Place the pan over medium heat and slowly bring the mixture  to a boil, stirring often. Once it reaches a boil, let it continue to boil  slowly for 8 minutes without stirring. Remove the pan from the heat and  pour the sauce into a container. Let it cool for 15 minutes if serving hot,  or cover and refrigerate until needed. It will last for at least 1 month.  The sauce may be reheated slowly. Makes 2 1/2 Cups
