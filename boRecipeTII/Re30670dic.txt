Onion, boneless pork, Water, Baking Powder, garlic, dried corn husks, Shortening, MASA HARINA, Red chili sauce, 
In a 4 1/2 to 5 quart dutch oven bring pork, water, onion, garlic, and 1  1/2 t salt to boiling. Simmer, covered, about 2 1/4 hrs until meat is very  tender. Remove meat from broth and cool Using two forks, shred meat,  discarding fat. You should have 3 1/2 to 4 c shredded meat. Strain broth  and reserve 5-6 cups. In a 3 quart saucepan, heat the red chili sauce and  add shredded meat. Simmer, covered about 10 minutes.    For MASA: beat shortening with a mixer on medium for 1 minute. Stir  together MASA HARINA, baking powder and 2 t salt. Alternately add MASA  HARINA mixture and broth to shortening, beating well after each addition.  Add just enough broth to make a thick creamy paste. Soak corn husks in warm  water for 5 minutes then rinse to remove and corn silk and debris. Drain.    To assemble each tamale, spread 2 T MASA mixture in the center of a husk.  Place 1 T meat sauce in the middle of the MASA. Fold in sides of husk then  fold up bottom. Place a mound of extra husks in the center of a steamer  basket in a dutch oven and put tamales in basket, open end up. Bring water  to boiling. Reduce heat. Cover and steam 40 minutes, adding more water as  necessary. Microwaving for a couple minutes works too.
