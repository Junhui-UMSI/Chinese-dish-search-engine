Comment: every Thanksgiving I make a breadbasket of homemade breads. I  include various breads , rolls, breadsticks, biscuits and muffins in it.  tomato bread is a favorite!    Lightly grease large bowl and two loaf pans with olive oil. In small  saucepan, heat juice, sauce and 2 tbsp olive oil to 120 F. Combine 3 cups  flour with yeast and remaining ingedients. Pour in tomatoe mix and beat 3  minutes. Gradually add remaining flour, mixing by hand, if necessary, until  it holds together enough to turn out on floured surface. The dough is quite  sticky, and yuou may need to add a little more flour, but not too much, or  you will have a dry bread. Knead about 5 minutes, until dough smooths out,  place in greased bowl, cover and let rise 1 hour. Punch dough down, let  rest 15 minutes, then shape into 2 loaves, and place in pans. Cover pans  and let rise 45 minutes.Preheat oven to 375 F Bake loaves 10 minutes,  reduce heat to 350 F and bake 30-40 minutes longerBread is done when loaf  sounds hollow when thumped with knuckle. Tip loaves out immediately onto  wire rack to cool  Posted to Recipe Archive -  3 November 96    Date: Sun, 3 Nov 96 13:20:43 EST    submitted by: LIR119@delphi.com
