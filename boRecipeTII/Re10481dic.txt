COMMENTS: Lorna  Brown says shes been doing this for years. She simply pushes thawed dough  onto a greased sheet cake pan, lets it rest a few minutes, then stretches  it again to fit the pan. She makes dents with her knuckles and either  presses fresh herbs into those dents before spreading 2 tablespoons olive  oil over the dough; or spreads the oil first, then sprinkles on dried or  granulated herbs of choice. She tops it off with salt and bakes it at 350  degrees until golden. **Generally 1 tsp dried herb may be substituted for  each tbs (3 tsp) of fresh. Bridgford makes bread dough.
