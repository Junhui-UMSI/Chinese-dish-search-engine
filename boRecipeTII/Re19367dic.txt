Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish; set  aside.    In a medium saucepan, bring the broth and milk to a boil over medium heat.  Add the rice and cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine  the corn and peas and break them up to separate. Stir in the flour, oregano  and pepper. Add the green onions and ham. Add the cheddar cheese and  parsley. Blend; set aside.    In a small bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with about -1/3 cup of the  hot broth-milk mixture until smooth. Stir the cream cheese into the  vegetable mixture.

Stir several  times during baking for even cooking. Makes 6 servings.    ~ From "Thursday Is Potluck" (Time-Life Books, $14.95).
