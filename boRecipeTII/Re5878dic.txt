Piri-Piri Chinese Hot Sauce
Piri-piri chopped,, Seeds and all, Garlic, Sugar, Soy sauce, Powdered ginger, Sherry, Sesame oil, 
Put the chopped chiles in oil and fry til brown, add chopped garlic and fry  it a while.  Then add everything else, bring to boil, lower heat and simmer  for a few minutes.  Strain, cool and store.    I felt like a chemist making the stuff.  I put it on a back burner under  the vent and stood back while stirring it.  I didnt know what to expect. I  tasted the sauce by just dipping a spoon into it and letting the sauce  drain off the spoon and then gently taking a little taste by placing the  spoon on the tip of my tongue.  At first nothing, then after about 15  seconds or so it kicks in. Actually tasted pretty good.
