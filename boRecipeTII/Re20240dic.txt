A great chili relies on a sophisticated blend of seasonings. This one uses  both fresh chilies and dried chili powder along with a spark of garlic,  cilantro and fresh lemon juice.    Dredge the veal in flour seasoned with salt and pepper and brown on all  sides in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Set aside.    Add the, remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan and soften the onion, 2  garlic cloves and the chile pepper in it.    Add the chili powder, cumin bay leaf basil thyme oregano and flour; cook 2  minutes. Add the reserved meat and toss well in the spices.    Deglaze the pan with the wine and boil until alcohol evapo- rates.    Add the chicken stock and tomatoes. Simmer, partially cov- ered, for 1  hour, or until the veal is tender.    Add the artichoke hearts and chick-peas and simmer 10 minutes longer.    Remove pan from heat and stir in the lemon juice, cilantro and remaining  minced garlic.
