Possum and Taters
Sugar, Salt, fat possum, Butter, Sweet potatoes, 
First, catch a possum.  This in itself is excellent entertainment on a  moonlit night.  Skin the possum and remove the head and feet.  Be sure to  wash it thoroughly.  Freeze overnight, either outside or in a refrigerator.  When ready to cook, peel the potatoes and boil them tender in lightly  salted water along with the butter and sugar.  At the same time, stew the  possum until tender in a tightly covered pan with a little water. Arrange  the taters around the possum, strip with bacon, sprinkle with thyme or  marjoram, or pepper, and brown in the oven. Baste often with the drippings.
