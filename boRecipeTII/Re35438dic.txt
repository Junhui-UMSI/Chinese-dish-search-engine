submitted by: sgjg6566@pipeline.com  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Brown ground beef in a small amount of oil in  Dutch oven.  Add chopped onion, peppers, tomatoes with liquid and beer.  Cook together until all the vegetables are tender, add the seasonings and  cook another 10 minutes. Place the Dutch oven into oven and bake for 1  hour.  I serve this with fresh cornbread and apple pie for dessert.    Recipe Archive - 15 July 96    From the RECIPEinternet: Recipes from Around the World recipe list.
