Lotties True Bajan Premium Hot Pepper Sauce has been my favorite hot sauce  for years. Early in 1996, my sources for this started to dry up and I now  understand that they have discontinued production. Numerous letters to the  home office in Barbados went unanswered. As I nervously approached the  bottom of my last jar, I decided it was time to make it for myself. So  using my trusty gas chromatograph analyser and utilizing mass spectroscopy  techniques learned in Nuclear Engineering 401, I ventured forth and  duplicated the recipe.  The ingredients shown on the label were: Hot  peppers, mustard, vinegar, sugar, salt, onion and garlic. Analysis showed  that there was also mango, curry, cumin, chili powder and black pepper.    And now, the directions: Place the seeded peppers and vinegar in a blender  and grind it fine. Slowly add the other ingredients and process until  smooth.  Pour into two 12 ounce Lotties jars and enjoy.    Tom Greaves  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #138    Date: Tue, 22 Oct 96 09:51 EST    From: Tom Greaves <0007168628@mcimail.com>
