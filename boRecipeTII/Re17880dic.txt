Ingredients        1/2    gallon of milk 2-3 Tbsp lemon juice    Preparation    Put the milk in a stainless steel pot and start boiling it. Its best if  you stir it with a wooden sppon. You must stir it regularly, to make sure  it doesnt burn (if it burns, it will be absolutely unusable).    Once the milk is thoroughly boiling, remove the heat and add the lemon  juice. The milk starts curdling right now. Have another pot ready. Also,  youll need a strainer covered with a cheesecloth. Scoop the curds and whey  into the strainer, dripping the liquids into the pot. The curds should all  have remained in the cheesecloth. Wrap the cheesecloth so as to cover the  curds completely. Press the cheesecloth a little bit with your hands or a  spoon. The point is to squeeze every last bit of whey out of the paneer.  Makes 1 block of paneer cheese. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Tania Hewes  <taniah@NSERV1.CLSI.US.GEAC.COM> on
