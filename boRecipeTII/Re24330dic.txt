I modified it to make it fatfree and it is wonderful!  It is  nicely gingery, chewy and moist. It is not low calorie with all that sugar,  but makes a nice treat! from Bon Appetit (12/93). Makes one 8" loaf.     Preheat oven to 350F.  Lightly spray a 8 1/2 x 4 1/2" loaf pan with  non-stick spray.  Sift first 6 ingredients into medium bowl. Mix in 3 Tabs  crystallized ginger.  Set aside.  Beat prune puree and applesauce and both  sugars in large bowl until light and fluffy.  Beat in egg substitute.  Mix  in fresh ginger. Stir in dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk,  beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Transfer to prepared pan.  Sprinkle 3 Tabs crystallized ginger over batter; press lightly into batter.  Bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 min. Cool  in pan on rack 10 min. Turn out onto rack and cool completely. (Can be made  one day ahead of serving. Cover; store at room temp.)    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #50    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
