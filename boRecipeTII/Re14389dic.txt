Dissolve yeast in 2/3 c water while your milk is cooling. Dissolve 1 cup  sugar in the hot milk.  Stir all ingredients in large bowl, turn out and  knead about 5 minutes, adding flour if needed. Knead about 5 minutes. Let  rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Knead down and shape  into 6 loaves, let rise until doubled in pans. Bake at 375 degrees F. for  40 minutes.  Turn out on wire rack and let cool to cold before slicing, if  you can. NOTE: Raisins and/or walnuts can be added for a change.  Also this bread freezes well.
