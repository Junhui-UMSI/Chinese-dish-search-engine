Wild Mushroom Sauce
Whipping cream, Unsalted butter, Assorted fresh mushrooms, Salt, Sherry or Madeira, Dried mushrooms, Finely minced garlic, Finely minced shallots, 
This sauce has an intensely woodsy flavor that would be good on pasta,  roast chicken or pork. TO RECONSTITUTE DRIED MUSHROOMS, place them in a  bowl and cover with 3 cups of warm water. Soak for at least 2 hours or up  to 8. When mushrooms are soft, drain and reserve water and squeeze out as  much water as you can from the mushrooms. Pour the mushroom water through a  double layer of cheesecloth or a cloth towel to remove any sand that may  have been lurking in the mushrooms. Reserve 1 cup of liquid for this  recipe. (Pour the remaining mushroom water into a plastic container or  airtight bag, label and freeze for up to a year to use in soups and  sauces.) Wash the fresh mushrooms and pat dry. (Slice chanterelles and  cultivated mushrooms, trim and discard the stems of shiitake mushrooms, and  trim and discard root tips of oyster mushrooms.) Melt the butter in a  medium skillet over medium heat and add the reconstituted dried mushrooms,  garlic, shallots and salt. Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the fresh  mushrooms and continue to cook another 10 minutes. Add the reserved  mushroom water and sherry. Increase the heat to high and cook until the  liquid reduces by about 2/3. Add the cream and cook until the liquid  reduces to a saucelike consistency and is thick enough to coat a spoon.
