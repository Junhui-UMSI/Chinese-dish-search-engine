Cantonese Fried Rice
Vegetable oil, Onion, Eggs, Soy sauce, Rice, Pepper, 
Source:Spice and Spirit    In 10 inch skillet, heat oil on medium flame. Add diced onion and saute  until translucent. Add eggs and fry, stirring constantly to break eggs into  tiny pieces. Add soy sauce and stir. Add cooked rice. Sprinkle with dash of  pepper. Combine well, stirring over heat, about 2 minutes. Add a little  more soy sauce if necessary.    The first time I made this I doubled the rice because I did not focus on  the word cooked rice. Forwarned is forarmed.
