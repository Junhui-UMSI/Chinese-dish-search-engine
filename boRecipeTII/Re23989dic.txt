With a 3-inch cookie cutter (or drinking glass), cut out circles of bread.  Heat the clarified butter in a skillet until hot and fry the bread circles,  browning on both sides. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Rinse the  turtle meat in cold water and drain. Put the turtle, stock and wine in a  3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer and cook until the  meat is tender-2 to 3 hours, depending on the size and age of the turtle.  Remove the meat from the liquid. Cool the meat and cut into bite-size  pieces, removing all bones. Set aside. Return the stock to heat, add the  mushrooms and cook 5 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and set aside. Over high  heat, reduce the stock to about 1/2 cup. Add the sherry and cream and  reduce to about 1/4 cup. Remove from heat and add the unsalted butter in  small pieces, whisking well until the butter is absorbed before adding  more. Season with salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste. Add the  reserved meat and mushrooms and heat just barely to warm the meat through.  Place 1 piece of toast on each of 6 warm plates. Spoon the meat and sauce  mixture over the toast, dividing evenly. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
