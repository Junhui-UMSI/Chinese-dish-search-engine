Beaus Jalapeno Bean Dip
Monosodium glutamate, Ham bits (include juice,, Jalapeno peppers (fresh, Mexene chili powder, Minced onion flakes, Pinto beans (16-oz), 
Blend ingredients well and serve.    Beaus notes:    *  There are no "jalapeno beans;" there are jalapeno peppers and pinto  beans.  I have two recipes, both of which are quite tref, but a Catholic  should worry? But if you are hosting a Jewish person, smoked turkey will  substitute most agreeably for the chazer called for in either recipe.]
