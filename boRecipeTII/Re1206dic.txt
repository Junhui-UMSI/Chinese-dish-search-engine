First, saute one onion and one green pepper, coarsely chopped, with three  or four cloves of garlic, minced, in olive oil.  Throw into the crockpot.  Also throw in a small can of diced green chiles. Depending on your  propensity for spicy food, you may add from one to three jalapenos, sliced.  Then, throw some tomatillos in the pot.  Peel off the husk and coarsely  chop.    Take about 2 pounds of lean pork (trim off all the excess fat you can),  cubed, and brown in the pan that you sauteed the onion, etc. in. Into the  pot. Now, the seasoning mixture. I prefer to grind up in my mortar oregano,  some dried red chile peppers, sage, and cumin seed. Perhaps also some black  pepper.  I almost never put salt in anything, so I probably wouldnt here  either, but you may want to. How much? Well, about 2 teaspoon each of the  oregano and the sage. 1 teaspoon each of the cumin seed and dried red  peppers.  Salt and pepper to taste.  I probably will add a dash of beer  (about 1/2 cup) for obscure reasons.      This crockpots all day, or could be simmered for probably about        2    hours.      Traditionally, this is served in bowls, with hot flour tortillas, salsa,  and cilantro.  You can also have sour cream, grated cheese, olives, and  pickled carrots and jalapenos around. Of course, you wrap all this up in  the tortillas, making killer burritos.      I throw one twist into this, a technique that comes from carnitas. After  cooking, I separate the meat from the broth, crisp the meat under the  broiler, and reduce the sauce in the pan. This adds a great texture to the  meat, and keeps the burritos from being too soggy.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Beth Ide" <rev_ide@email.msn.com> on Sep  27, 1998
