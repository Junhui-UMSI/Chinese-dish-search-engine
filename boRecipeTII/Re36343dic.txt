Beef/chicken Fajitas in Lime Juice
Chopped Tomatoes, Onions, Fresh coriander leaves, Peppers, Garlic, Cumin, Lime juice, Yogurt, Beef or chicken, Salsa, 
LIME JUICE is our basic fajitas recipe.  Marinate the beef or chicken  in  lots of lime juice, at least a few hours.  Then we grill (if its a fillet)  or saute (if its strips or raining), sauteeing usually with cumin.     To serve:  my husband prefers plain meat with some fresh coriander leaves  added as he wraps in tortillas.  I want more vegies so I usually sautee  onions and peppers, usually with lots of cumin and some garlic, but the  spices varies. I also eat the fajitas with the fresh coriander, yogurt, and  maybe chopped tomatoes or some salsa.     The fresh coriander is essential for us.
