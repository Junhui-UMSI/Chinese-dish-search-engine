Cream butter and sugar. Add eggs and other ingredients. I make small  balls and press with a glass dipped in sugar, either plain or  colored. This will also roll out for cutting. I have used a plastic  easter egg as a cutter at Easter with colored sugar sprinkles. Aunt  Gladys got it from the cook on the ranch in Wyoming and packed them  in ice cream cartons (those round ones--anyone remember?) for the  men. When I married and moved to Louisiana, they called them Teacakes!    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
