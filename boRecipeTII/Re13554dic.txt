Wiener Backhendl Viennese Fried Chicken
Lemon, Water, Paprika, Salt, All-purpose flour, Eggs, Butter, frying chickens, Vegetable oil, Dry breadcrumbs, Parsley, Lemon juice, 
Cut chicken into serving pieces.  Sprinkle with lemon juice; let stand 15  minutes.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper; coat with flour. In a small bowl,  beat together eggs, oil, and water.  Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture  until well coated.  Coat with breadcrumbs. Shake off any excess  breadcrumbs.  Let chicken pieces stand 15 to 20 minutes before frying. Melt  enough butter or margerine in 1 or two large skillets to make two inches of  fat.  Carefully place coated chicken pieces in hot fat. Brown lightly on  both sides.  Reduce heat and cook gently until tender, about 20 minutes.  Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon or kitchen tongs; drain on paper  towels. Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Arrange chicken in an open baking pan.  Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until breadcrumb coating is very dry and crusty.  Arrange chicken on a warm serving dish.  Garnish with parsley and lemon  wedges.  Serve with a green salad and potatoes.
