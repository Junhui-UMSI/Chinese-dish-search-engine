Soak beans in 6 cups water for at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain and  discard soaking water.    In a 5- or 6-quart pot, bring 8 cups of water, along with pre-soaked pinto  beans and bay leaf, to a boil. Simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes.    Add the onion, bell pepper, celery, chives, celery salt, garlic, tamari,  cayenne pepper, cumin and olive oil. Return mixture to a boil, then reduce  heat and simmer, covered, until beans are tender, about 30 minutes.    In a blender, combine 2 cups of the hot soup broth with cornmeal and  imitation bacon bits until smooth. (Keep lid on tight.) Stirring  constantly, gradually add cornmeal mixture to soup. Simmer and continue  cooking for about 10 minutes, or until cornmeal is cooked (soup will  thicken). Add sea salt, and adjust seasonings to taste. Serve hot.
