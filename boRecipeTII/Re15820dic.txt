Absolutely Apricot
Dried Apricots; chopped, Salt, Bread flour, Apricot Jam, Dry milk, -Water, Butter, Yeast; (active dry), 
If your machine offers the option, use the "light crust" setting as the  crust browns more due to the sugar content of the jam. Try to use a jam  with a high fruit content & few additives. This recipe can be baked on the  regular, rapid bake, or timed settings. I have a DAK Turbo II & baked it on  the reg setting.  It was one of the few loaves that have turned out really  well lately...think my DAK is dying; just today ordered a ZOJI from Irwin.  The bread kept VERY well in a Rubbermaid container...was nice & fresh for a  whole week (I forgot about the last couple of slices!). I even made it when  MY mother-in-law came to visit & she LOVED it! Hope it turns out good for  you.
