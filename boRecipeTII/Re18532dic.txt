Amazing Corn Bread
Cornmeal, Apple made into applesauce*, Sugar, Skim milk, Baking Powder, Egg whites, Flour, Salt (I omit), 
Preheat oven to 425f. Grease a pan ( I used a medium vision pot sprayed  lightly with Pam) and put in oven to preheat. Mix all ingredients, pour  batter into heated pan and bake for 20 min.    This cornbread was quite moist and flavourful. Id cut the sugar down or  out if you were going to serve it with chilli or something like that. It is  really great hot out of the oven with molasses. (It was the molasses  discussions that got me thinking about ff corn bread. I have succesfully  kept in an airtight container over night in the fridge....sorry, it  doesent last any longer!    *To make applesauce quick I cut up 1 apple and put in a bowl with a bit of  water and then microwave on high for about 2 min. Then I use my handblender  to make it into sauce. Make sure you do this in a tall, thin container as  it tends to spit up and hot apple sauce really burns! One apple makes about  1/3 of a cup so you could use storebought for this.
