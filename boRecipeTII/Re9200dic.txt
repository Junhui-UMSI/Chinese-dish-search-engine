Prune Filling (For Hamentaschen)
Seedless orange, Sugar; if desired, Raisins, Pitted prunes; (12 ounces), 
Steel Knife: Cut orange in quarters, but do not peel. Process half the  orange until fine, about 20 seconds. Add half the remaining ingredients.  Process until fine, about 15 to 20 seconds. Empty processor bowl. Repeat  with remaining ingredients.    Yield: about 2 1/2 cups filling.    May be prepared in advance and refrigerated or frozen.    Note: It is a good idea to feel the prunes with your fingertips to make  sure that no pits have been overlooked before packaging. Otherwise, you  could damage the Steel Knife.    If you wish to add nuts, process about 1/4 cup walnuts for 4 to 5 seconds.  Empty bowl and process remaining ingredients. Add nuts and process a few  seconds longer.
