Chocolate Hazelnut Meringues
Hazelnuts, Parchment paper, Egg whites, Cream of tartar, Vanilla extract, Granulated sugar, Chocolate chips, 
Toast hazelnuts on a cookie sheet in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 8  minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees for baking the  meringues. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.    In a medium bowl, combine the egg whites with the cream of tartar and the  vanilla. Beat at medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Add the sugar  slowly to the egg mixture, one tablespoon at a time, while beating. Beat  until all of the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is stiff and glossy.  Using a large rubber spatula, fold in the chocolate morsels and the nuts.  Drop slightly rounded tablespoons onto parchment-lined baking sheets,  allowing 1 inch between spoonfuls. Bake for 30 minutes at 300 degrees.  Leaving the meringues int the oven, turn the oven off and allow cookies to  sit in the oven for at least one hour, until they are completely dry and  crisp. Remove from the oven and transfer to wire cooling racks.
