Hot-marinade the venison by combining it with the water or stock,  wine, onion, garlic, & salt, & bring all these ingredients to a boil.  Let them simmer, covered, for 1 hour, or until the venison is tender.  Add currants or currant jelly & chanterelles, & bring back to a boil.  Thicken with the arrowroot-and- water mixture. The use of currant  jelly instead of fresh currants will make a slightly sweeter sauce.  Adjust for salt, & serve with rice.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
