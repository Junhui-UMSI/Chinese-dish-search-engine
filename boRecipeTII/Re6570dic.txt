Heat the water, salt, peppercorns, lemon  slices, parsley, onion, and bay leaf to boiling, in a 12-inch skillet then  reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer 5 minutes.  Place the salmon steaks in  the skillet, adding water if necessary to cover the steaks.  Heat to  boiling and then reduce the heat.  Simmer uncovered 12 to 15 minutes or  until the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Serve with the Hollandaise  Sauce.    HOLLANDAISE SAUCE:    Stir the egg yolks and lemon juice vigorously in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan.  Add 1/4 cup of the butter and stir over very low heat, stirring  constantly, until the butter is melted.  Add the remaining butter.  Continue stirring vigorously until the butter is melted and the sauce is  thickened.  (Be sure the butter melts slowly as this gives the eggs time  to cook and thicken the sauce without curdling.)  Serve hot or at room  temperature.  Cover and refrigerate any remaining sauce.  To serve again,  stir in a small amount of hot water.    From Rich, Sysop of The "New" Home BBS, 104/419.
