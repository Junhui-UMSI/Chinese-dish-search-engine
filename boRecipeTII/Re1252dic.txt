Well, thanks, David, for the kind words...I have been cooking for quite a  while, and I love to cook, and love to eat, and I dunno how I manage to  keep my weight to 10 stone(if a stone is 16 lbs) Here is the curried pork  tenderloin...if you have ginger wine available to you, use it instead of  white wine.    Step 1: Cut the meat into about one inch pieces, toss with the wine, VERY  little salt, and the cornflour...let sit until well absorbed and mix again,  if too wet add more cornflour, if too dry, more wine, place in fridge for  up to six hours.    Step 2: While the pork is marinating, start the onions in a pan on low heat  with a little peanut oil, add the garlic, ginger and a little salt..let  this go for about five minutes on low, until the onion, garlic and ginger  become fragrant, then sprinkle in the curry powder, at least 1 tbls, or  more if the spirit moves you! Simmer on low for another five minutes, and  add 2/3 of the can of coconut milk, adding one tbls cornflour to the  remainder, set aside, let the curry mixture continue on simmer, after  adding the habs for about fifteen minutes.    While this is doing, put 1/4 cup peanut oil in a wok, and stir fry the pork  pieces, until they are well browned, set aside when all done, and keep  warm. Check for thickness of the curry mixture, and add the remaining  coconut milk, cornflour mixture, to thicken, add all of the reserved pork,  stir around, and throw in the basil and sesame oil to taste.    Serve with Thai rice and a stir fry of vegetables of your choice.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Dec  06, 1998,
