Melt the butter over low heat, then saute the onions until soft. Add the  choped tomatoes and their juices, the chicken broth, and the water, and  bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat for 10 minutes. Then  stir in half the sour cream and the cheddar. Add the rest of the sour cream  and gently reheat (if necessary).    This soup also freezes very well, just dont reheat too quickly or you will  curdle the sour cream.    EAT-L Digest 24 June 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
