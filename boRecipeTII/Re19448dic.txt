Vegetarian Green Chile Sauce
Onion, White pepper, Tomatoes, Vegetable broth or water, Clove garlic minced, Chopped; roasted chile, Salt, Cornstarch dissolved in 2 T., 
The recipes below are from the Rancho de Chimayo Cookbook -- certainly one  of my favorite New Mexican restaurants!    Combine all ingredients except the cornstarch in a large saucepan and bring  to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the mixture for 10-15 minutes. Add the  cornstarch. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 to 10 minutes. The  sauce should be thickened but quite pourable with no taste of raw  cornstarch.    Vegetarian chile sauce keeps up to 5 days in the fridge. Freezes well.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #250 by Cindy Wysocki <cysocki@trail.com> on  Sep 19, 1997
