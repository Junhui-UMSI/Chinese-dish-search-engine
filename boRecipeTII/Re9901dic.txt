Punch Recipe #1
Sugar, unsweetened juice, Boiling water, Jello, strawberry, Cold water, 7-Up,

Stir in 2 cups sugar, 4 cups cold water, and a 46  oz can of unsweetened pineapple juice. Freeze in containers (overnight is  best) to be slushy. Put frozen mixture in punch bowl and add a 2 liter  bottle of 7-UP just before serving. I use the ladel and stir to chop of  frozen mixture into a type of slush. Serves 40.    I have used diet 7-UP or diet Sprite or Diet Slice in place of regular soda  since the sugar and jello make it really sweet.  For receptions or weddings  you can also use food coloring in a neutral jello or light color jello such  as orange pineapple and can color this to any color. A friend wanted it to  be purple because of a colors in her wedding so she used grape jello but  the yellow pineapple juice turned it brown - to save the color she added  red and blue until she got the color she wanted. Another example is that I  use the orange pineapple and use green food coloring (instead of using lime  jello because of the flavor) to get a punch for halloween. Hope you enjoy!
