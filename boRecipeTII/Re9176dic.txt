Baking soda, Baking Powder, Orange juice, Chopped pecans (optional), Whole wheat flour, Prune Butter *, Dried grated orange rind OR, Fresh grated orange rind, 
Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and orange peel, and stir to  mix well.  Add the Prune Butter and orange juice, and stir just until the  dry ingredients are moistened.  Fold in the pecans if desired.    Coat an 8-x-4-inch loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray.  SPread the  mixture evenly in the pan, and bake at 350F for about 40 minutes, or just  until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out  clean.

It is not available  commerically without added sweetener, but 1 c of it can be made in a food  processor with 8 oz pitted prunes and 6 tb water or fruit juice (I used  apple juice in the batch I made for this recipe).    The Chefs Comments: "Last week, I made the Prune Butter, and decided to  try it out with one of the recipes in the book. This bread was good the  first night, but I wrapped it up and tried it again later in the week, and  it was terrible. It didnt have the stamina of other quickbreads, I guess."  ~ Lisa    From: Lisa Date: 09-08-96 (12:32) The Polka Dot Cottage, a BBS with a taste  of home. 1-973-822-3627    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #712 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  97
