Tortillas #1
-(up to), Masa flour, Warm water, 
In a bowl, mix masa flour with enough of the warm water to make dough hold  together well.  Shape into a smooth ball.  Divide into 12 equal pieces for  6 inch tortillas or into 24 equal pieces for 4 inch tortillas, and roll  each piece into a ball. Cover with a damp paper towel.     To shape wth a tortilla press, cover bottom half of press wtih wax paper  and place a ball of dough on paper, slightly off center, toward hinge end  of press. Lay another piece of wax paper on dough and close press tightly.  Repeat for remaining dough, stacking tortillas between pieces of wax paper.     To shape with a rolling pin, place a ball of dough between 2 pieces of wax  paper, flatten slightly with your hand.  Lightly run rolling pin over dough  several times.  Flip dough and paper over and roll out into a 4 to 6 inch  circle.  Carefully peel off top paper.  Repeat for remaining dough,  stacking tortillas between pieces of wax paper.     To make a perfectly shaped tortilla, use a knife to trim edges, or cut  dough into a circle with end of a 2 pound coffee can.     To cook, place a heavy uncoated 10 to 12 inch skillet over medium high  heat.  When pan is hot, lift tortilla, supporting it with paper, and turn  over into pan. At once, peel off paper. Cook tortilla until bottom is  flecked with brown (about 30 seconds). With a wide spatula, flip tortilla  over and cook for 1 minute more. Remove from pan and cover with foil.  Repeat for remaining tortillas.    ARIELLE@TARONGA.COM    (STEPHANIE DA SILVA)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
