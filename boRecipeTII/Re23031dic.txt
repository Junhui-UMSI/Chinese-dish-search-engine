Trout with Bay Leaf
Rainbow trout, Garlic, Salad oil, butter, bacon, Juice of 2 lemons, Chopped parsley, Black Pepper, Dried thyme, Salt, Bay Leaves, 
Preheat oven to hot (400).   Sprinkle the trout inside and outside with salt and pepper. Crush the  garlic and thyme together to make a paste. Put some of the paste in each  fish.  Place one bay leaf in the interior of each fish. Neatly wrap the  fish in bacon, using 2 slices for each fish.   Oil a baking dish large enough to hold all the trout and arrange them in  it. Sprinkle with melted butter and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until  bacon and fish are done. Baste the fish as they cook.   Transfer the fish to a warm serving platter and sprinkle with lemon juice  and parsley.  Serve, if desired, with buttered boiled potatoes sprinkled  with parsley.
