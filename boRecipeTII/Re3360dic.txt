Hi Everyone: I really like "one pot" recipes and this one from the LA  Times, issued 3/l2/92 really fits that for me. Now, if I could just get rid  of the "pot" I carry around my waist, we would be in business!  :) :) This recipe is by Fatima Lakhani, author of "Indian Recipes for a  Healthy Heart." Combine tomatoes, peas, yogurt, garlic, ginger, coriander,  cumin, garam masala, l/2 tsp. salt, and turmeric in bowl. Heat canola oil  in large saucepan.  Add onion, green chiles, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns  and cumin seeds and saute until onion starts to turn golden. Add tomato  mixture and stir. Cover and cook over medium heat l0 minutes, stirring  occasionally.  Add water, remaining 3/4 tsp. salt, potatoes and cilantro.  Stir well, cover and bring to boil. Add rice, stir gently and cook,  covered, until almost all the water has been absorbed, about l0 minutes.  Reduce heat to low and cook l0 to l5 minutes, or until rice is tender.
