Braised Cabbage
Sugar, Onion, Apple juice, Granny Smith apple, Vegetable oil, Salt, Red cabbage, Cider vinegar, Bay leaf, 
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil. Add the onion; cook stirring as  needed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cabbage, apple juice,  vinegar, sugar, salt and bay leaf; cook covered, until the cabbage is very  tender, about 20 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and stir in the apple; cook,  uncovered, about 5 minutes longer.    *Note: I omitted the oil. Instead I sprayed the skillet with nonstick  vegetable spray and sauteed the onion in about 1/3 cup of nonfat chicken  broth. (can also use vegetable broth)    Delicious cold in a salad!
