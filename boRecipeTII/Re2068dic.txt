Angel Cake
Cake flour, Sugar, Egg whites, Pure vanilla extract, Almond extract, Salt, 
Miranda wants a fatfree angel cake recipe. I think all angel cakes are  fatfree. Any standard, general cookbook will have a basic angel cake  recipe. Here is one from Dean Ornishs Eat More, Weigh Less.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift flour and 3/4 cup sugar together 3 times.  Set aside. White the egg whites til foamy with the whisk attachment of an  electric mixer. Gradually beat in the rest of the sugar. Ad the extracts  and salt. Beat just until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat. Remove the  bowl from the mixer.    With a whish or spatula, fold the flour and sugar mixture by thirds into  the egg whites. Place the batter in an ungreased 10 inch tube pan. Bake for  40 - 45 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and springs back to the  touch. Invert the cake until cool. Remove from pan and serve.    serving size = 1/10 or cake      168    calories      0.1    grams fat 0 milligrams cholesterol     97.4    grams sodium    Note from Jan, do not use a plastic bowl for egg whites, any trace of fat  will cause them not to whip up properly.
