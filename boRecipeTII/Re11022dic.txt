*Bouquet garni is one bayleaf plus spring of thyme and parsley tied  together.    In a large skillet or saute pan heat vegetable oil and brown the meat  chunks in several batches, adding more oil as needed. Do not crowd the pan.  Remove meat from the pan and set aside.    Add the vegetables and cook until lightly browned - if necessary add more  oil.  Add the red wine to the pan deglazing it by scraping up the browned  bits.  Add the bouquet garni and salt and pepper to taste. Return the  browned meat to the pan.  Simmer covered slowly for one hour and then add  the stock. Uncover the pan and increase the heat and let reduce for 1/2  hour. Towards the end of the cooking time remove the meat and let the  liquid reduce to a sauce like consistency. Defat the sauce and return the  meat to the pan just to reheat.    Drain meat when hot and remove to a serving dish. Strain the pan sauce,  adjust the seasonings and pour sauce over the meat.    Serve with mashed potatoes and green salad    Washington Post 2/7/96    == Courtesy of Dale & Gail Shipp, Columbia Md. ==                                          Date:
