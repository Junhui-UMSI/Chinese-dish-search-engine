SEE BELOW, 
*Use Basic Recipe  *Use Graham Cracker Crust found under Crust Variations.    Candy canes, a seasonal favorite, add yummy flavor as well as festive color  to our delectable peppermint cheesecake.  We think it works especially  well with our graham cracker crust.    Add 1 tsp peppermint extract to basic recipe with vanilla.  Reserve 1 cup  batter.  Pour remaining into prepared pan.  Add 1/2 cup coarsely chopped  hard peppermint candies and 1-2 drops red food coloring to reserved batter;  swirl into batter in pan.  Bake as directed.  Garnish chilled cake just  before serving with crushed peppermint candies, if desired.
