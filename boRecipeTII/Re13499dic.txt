Whole-Wheat Focaccia
Active dry yeast, All-purpose flour, olive oil, Salt, Honey, water, Whole-wheat flour, White cornmeal, Non-stick cooking spray, 
Stir honey into the warm water in a measuring cup or small bowl. Sprinkle  yeast over water and stir until yeast dissolves. Let mixture stand in  draft-free area about 5 minutes or until yeast begins to bubble. Mix flour  and cornmeal with salt and oil in a food processor fitted with a steel  blade or in an electric mixer with a dough hook. To mix dough by hand, use  a bowl and wooden spoon. Pour in yeast mixture and process until a soft,  almost sticky dough is formed, 5 to 10 seconds. If using an electric mixer,  mix 3 minutes or until a smooth dough is formed. If mixing dough by hand,  mix ingredients until a smooth, slightly sticky dough is formed, 3 to 5  minutes. Knead dough by hand on a lightly floured board or pastry cloth  until smooth. If dough is too sticky, add flour by the tablespoon until it  reaches the desired consistency. Put dough in a bowl and cover lightly with  oiled plastic wrap and aluminum foil or a kitchen towel. Let dough rise  until it doubles in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Punch dough down and let  stand 5 minutes. Knead for a few minutes more on a lightly floured board or  pastry cloth. Divide dough in half and pat each half into a sprayed 9"  baking pan or spring-form pan. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bake focaccia  in the center of the oven for 25 minutes or until it tests done. The  focaccia is done when a tooth pick inserted in the center comes out dry. It  will be golden brown on top and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and  cool.
