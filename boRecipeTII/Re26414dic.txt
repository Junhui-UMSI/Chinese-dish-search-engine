Tomato Coulis
Shallots; chopped, Unsalted butter, Salt, Chervil, parsley, basil or, Ripe tomatoes, about 6, Garlic, Carrots; chopped, 
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high  heat. Cook the garlic, carrots and shallots until soft, about 6 minutes.    Meanwhile cut the tomatoes in half across the width and squeeze out the  seeds. Roughly chop.    Add the tomatoes to the pan, reduce heat to low, and cook, uncovered, 20  minutes. Stir occasionally to avoid scorching.    Transfer the mixture to a food processor or blender and puree. Pour back  into the pan and place over low heat. Break the remaining butter into about  6 pieces and stir into the sauce until it melts. Stir in the fresh herbs  and remove from heat. Serve hot.
