Chinese Sausage Potstickers
Chinese sausages *, Uncooked short-grain rice, pickled ginger, dried shiitake, Sweetened chile sauce *, Green onions, green chiles  , Dry white wine, Salt and ground white, Potsticker wrappers, Chinese sesame oil, 
1. Cook the sausage in a saucepan over medium heat until some of the fat is  rendered, about 5 minutes.    2. Add the rice, pickled ginger, mushrooms, chile sauce, green onions, and  chiles, and reduce the heat to low. Stir and cook for a minute or two,  without browning the rice.    3. Strain the reserved mushroom liquid through a double thickness of paper  towels and add 1 cup of it, along with the wine, to the rice. Bring to a  boil over high heat and cover. Reduce the heat to low and cook until all  the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.    4. Transfer the rice mixture to a bowl and place in the freezer to chill  for about 30 minutes.    5. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    6. Place a generous teaspoonful of the mixture in the center of each  wrapper. Fold in half; slightly dampen the outer edges with cold water.  Press the edges together to seal, using the tines of a fork or a potsticker  mold.    7. Place on an oiled cookie sheet and brush the tops with sesame oil. Bake  until crisp, about 15-20 minutes.    Can assemble up to 1 day in advance and refrigerate, or flash freeze* for  up to 3 months. Do not thaw before baking; just add 5-10 minutes to the  baking time.    NOTE: I prefer to fry, steam and then brown until they stick to the pot.  Thats why they are called Pot Stickers.
