Heres one recipe I like a lot.  It is for a Breadman 1 1/2 lb loaf, using  the medium cycle (2 1/2 hours total):  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : schapin@smiley.mitre.org (Susan L Chapin)  NOTES :  am allergic to wheat, but not to gluten, and I make many       wonderful breads       by using 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten and 2 1/2 cups other flours.       Flours       I use include:  brown rice flour, barley flour, teff flour, oat       flour,       oat flakes, soy flour, amaranth flour, quinoa flour, and many       more,       including kamut flour.  Kamut is a wheat, and I can tolerate it,       and I use       that as the basis for many of my breads.  Spelt is a wheat, also,       but I       cant tolerate it at all.
