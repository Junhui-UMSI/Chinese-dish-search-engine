Aunt Edies Salad
Carrots, sliced 1/4" thick, Plain lowfat yogurt,, Red delicious apples,, Celery, chopped, Broccoli flowerets, Cauliflower flowerets, Orange juice, Artificial sweetener, 
Mix yogurt, orange juice, and artificial sweetener. Pour over vegetables  and mix. Thats it.    I use strained yogurt but the original recipe calls for light salad  dressing.
