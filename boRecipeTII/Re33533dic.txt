Wash the parsley and  place into a Cuisinart food processor and chop into fine fragments.  (This  should produce 2/3 to 3/4 cup of chopped parsley.)  Dont bother to remove  the parsley from the Cuisinart but change from using the chopping blade to  the plastic mixing blade.    Stir 1 package of dry yeast in 1 cup of warm water that contains 1 T.  honey; let stand. Place 1/2 cup (1 stick) of Fleishmanns Sweet unsalted  100% Corn oil spread or equivalent shortening into the microwave and heat  (on low) until it becomes a soft liquid. Put 2 eggs into a bowl and beat  until smooth in texture.    Into the Cuisinart, containing about 2/3 c. chopped parsley, add remaining  ingredients.  Proceed to mix until smooth, adding extra flour until the  mixture is no longer sticky.  Transfer to a floured board, cover with towel  and let the dough rise (about 90 minutes) to double in bulk in a warm  location.  Punch down and divide the dough into five parts; roll each piece  by hand into strips about 15 inches long. Braid three strips together and  put on a greased cookie sheet. Beat one egg and brush the Houska where the  strips cross. Twist together the remaining two strips and put on top of the  first layer. Cover and let rise about 45-60 minutes.    Brush the surface of the Houska.  Bake for about 35 minutes at 325 degrees  F.  When half done, brush again and rotate the pan.  The Houska should be  nicely browned when done.  Allow the Swallowtail Houska to cool before  cutting.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
