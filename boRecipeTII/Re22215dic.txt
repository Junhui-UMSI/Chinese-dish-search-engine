Turkey Scallopine
6 ounce Turkey Escalopes, Salt and pepper, Glass Sparkling Muscatel, Heavy Cream, Vegetable oil, Butter, 
Wrap the escalopes in clingfilm and flatten gently with the back of a heavy  frying pan until they are really thin. Peel off the clingfilm.    Heat the oil then the butter in a large frying pan. Put in the meat and  press down firmly so it is all in contact with the frying pan.    Let it sizzle for between one minute and a minute and a half, depending on  how thin youve managed to flatten the escalopes, turn them over and repeat  the timing.    The meat will be thoroughly cooked through - you do not ever want pink  turkey - but very tender. Put the meat on warmed plates.    Pour the grape juice or vermouth into the frying pan, stir it round to pick  up all the bits from the meat, then add the double cream and let it bubble  (double cream boils beautifully) and reduce slightly.    Pour it over the turkey and serve with pasta or new potatoes and mangetout.    Source: Michael Barry, Yes! Magazine
