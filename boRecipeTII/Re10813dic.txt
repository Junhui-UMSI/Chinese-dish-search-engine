Quince Chutney
Finely slivered peeled fresh, S sugar, Raspberry vinegar, Currants, (13/4 to 2 lbs.) quince, Ginger, 
Rinse quince. Cut in 1/4s ( quince can be very hard in the centre), cut  out core, then slice fruit into 1/4"thick pieces. Put ginger in a 3-4 qt.  pan and add 4-5 cups water. Bring to boiling, uncovered, on high heat.  Drain off water and add quince, vinegar, sugar and currants to pan. Bring  to boil, then boil gently, uncovered, until 1/2 cup syrup remains. Stir  occasionally. Serve warm or cool. If made ahead, cover and chill up to 2  weeks or freeze. I serve this will grilled chicken and apple-quince griddle  cakes.
