Slice the stems off the okra & the very tip at the other end. Slit each pod  lengthwise, leaving 1/4-inch unslit at both ends. Be careful not to cut the  pods completely in half.    Combine the crushed coriander, cumin & fennel seeds with the balck pepper,  garam masala, cayenne, asafetida, almonds, lemon juice & 2 tb of ghee.  Blend well, using your fingers if necessary till you have a dry oatmeal  type texture.    Using a butter knife, put about a 1/4 ts of the stuffing into each okra  pod, then press the edges closed & set aside covered till you are ready to  cook.    Place the rest of the ghee in a large skillet & heat till hot. Add the  stuffed okra pods & spread out in one layer. Keeping the heat moderate,  cook for 5 minutes, covered. Gently turn the okra to ensure even cooking.  Continue this for 20 to 25 minutes or until the okra is completely cooked.    Place the okra on paper towels & toss with salt. Serve piping hot.
