Yucca Con Mojo
See instr, 
Get a piece of yucca root in the grocery (looks like a firelog coated in  wax).    Peel the yucca, cut it into chunks, and boil as you would cook a potato.  When its tender, serve it with these sauces.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Alex Silbajoris <72163.1353@compuserve.com>  on Apr 6, 1998
