unflavored gelatin, Salt, brown suger, pumpkin  , Eggs, Gran. sugar, graham cracker shells, Pumpkin pie spice, 
Makes 2-9" pies, can be halved for one one 9" pie    In a three quart metal mixing bowl, thoroughly stir together gelatin, brown  sugar, salt and spice; stir in milk. With a whisk, beat in egg yolks, then  pumpin. Place bowl over a saucepan of boiling water: cook stirring often  until heated through and gelatin and sugar have dissolved, about 10-15 min.  (I test by feel, if its too hot to touch then its cooked). Chill until  mixture mounds when dropped from a spoon. Beat egg whites to soft peak  stage; gradually beat in granulated sugar until stiff; fold into gelatin  mixture. Turn into pie sheels; chill until firm. Before serving, top with  whipped cream or cool whip.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #184 by joleen@creighton.edu on Aug 7,  1997
