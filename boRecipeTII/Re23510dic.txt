Aromatic Chicken with Rice (Malaysia)
Sesame oil, Light soy sauce, Rice, Pepper, Salt, Chicken (3 pounds), Onion, 
Spread cooked rice in a pie pan.  Chop chicken into large pieces. Cut  onion into wedges.  In a wok or large pan heat sesame oil and brown  the chicken with the onions until the onions are transparent.  Add  soy sauce and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Put the chicken on the  cooked rice in the pie plate.  Steam for about 30 minutes or until  the chicken is done. Serve warm.    If you have a rice cooker, you can just put the braised onions and  chicken on top of the raw rice and cook it that way.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg Dec 17 1989.
