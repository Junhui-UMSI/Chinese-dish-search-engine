Trim green onions of roots and all but 2" of green, then slice very thinly.    Place half of tortillas on work surface and sprinkle each with 1/2 oz  cheese, making sure it is evenly distributed over the tortilla surface.  Scatter 1/4 c shredded turkey over each tortilla, then sprinkle each evenly  with mushrooms, red bell pepper, green onions, and parsley. Divide  remaining cheese among the tortillas, covering each with 1/2 oz cheese. Top  each with 1 remaining tortilla, creating a sandwich. Press down on  tortillas with the palm of your hand.    Make Avocado Cream: peel and seed avocado, then cut into large pieces.  Process ingredients in food processor until completely smooth. Scrape into  bowl; salt to taste and serve. Makes 1/4 c per serving.    Heat dry nonstick skillet over medium heat until very hot. Using large  spatula, place a quesadilla in skillet. Pressing down with spatula, cook  until cheese melts and tortilla browns slightly, about 2-3 minutes per  side; remove from skillet. Repeat process with remaining quesadillas.    Cut each quesadilla into quarters and serve immediately, garnished with  quartered limes, cilantro sprigs, and a dollop of Avocado Cream.    Theres barely any cooking needed for these quesadillas once the  ingredients are placed between the tortillas. All it takes is a quick saute  in a dry skillet to finish up this delicious dish. My refined Avocado Cream  on top is a lovely contrast to the crispy tortillas. If desired, serve a  bowl of your favorite salsa alongside.    ===============   Reply   40 of Note    1 =================  Board: FOOD BB  Topic:      FOOD SOFTWARE Subject:    Z-MM AVOCADOS   40+  To: BGMB90B  ELAINE RADIS          Date:    10/14 From:   BGMB90B    ELAINE RADIS Time:  11:43 AM    Recipe By     :    From: Cuponquen@aol.Com               Date: Sun, 12 Nov 1995 21:45:56 -0500    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
