Sweet Corn Relish
Molasses, Fresh Chile Pepper, olive oil, Red wine vinegar, Red Bell Pepper, Salt And Pepper, Red Onion, Corn, Fresh Parsley, Green Bell Pepper, 
Blanch corn in boiling salted water for 2 minutes and drain.    Place the corn around the edges of a HOT FIRE, where the heat is lower, so  it is just barely over the coals. Cook the corn, rolling it around  frequently, for about 3 minutes, or until well browned. Remove from the  grill.    As soon as the ears are cool enough to handle, slice the kernels from the  cobs into a small bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and toss well.
