Pesto Trapanese
Basil leaves, Salt, Black pepper, roughly chopped, olive oil, Spaghetti, Garlic, Tomatoes, peeled & diced, Almonds, blanched &, 
In a mortar pound the garlic, salt, and basil into a paste; add the almonds  little by little and then the tomatoes. When all ingredients are reduced to  a pulp, add the oil and pepper to taste (This can be done in an electric  blender, in which case add the oil at the beginning. The texture is quite  different, though.) Cook the pasta in boiling salted water, drain, and toss  in serving bowl with the pesto until it is evenly distributed. Serve at  once.
