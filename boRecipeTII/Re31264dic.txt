Bananas "Fried" in Honey
Honey, Cinnamon, Bananas, 
Cut bananas lenghtwise (peel them first, of course!) and place in non-stick  frying pan. Add one spoon of honey for each banana (more, if you feel  emotionally fragile and need lots of sweet). "Fry" at low heat, turning  sometimes the banana slices so that the melted honey covers them all over.  Its done when you cant resist looking at the bananas anymore and feel the  urge to eat them. Add cinnamon.    Posted by Michelle Dick, FATFREE listowner, while list was down.    From:    "T.D.Soldato (Teresa del Soldato)" <T.D.Soldato@open.ac.uk>    Date:    Tue, 07 May 96 08:29:29 PDT
