Chicken and Rice
Margarine; (parve), Chicken broth, Dairy Rich or other parve, salt and pepper, Poultry seasoning, Tarragon; (optional-I like, Onions diced, Celery sliced, Chickens cut into serving, Rice, 
Sautee onions and celery in margarine until onions are transparent. Add  broth, Dairy Rich, poultry seasoning and Rice. Mix together. (I use a  cooking spray to prepare the pan and make it easier to clean but if you use  the aluminum throw-away pans, you wouldnt have to do this) Pour a bit of  the rice/vegetable mixture in the bottom of the pan. Salt and pepper  chicken pieces. Arrange chicken pieces over that and then pour the rest of  the mixture over the chicken. Bake, covered at 350 degrees for a 90 minutes  or until chicken is cooked through and rice is soft. I use Minute Rice  sometimes and it works just as well. I hope this is a kosher recipe. I  tried to make sure nothing was out of the ordinary. This is one of my  familys favorite dishes and its so quick to put together. When I cook it  for my family, I only use 1/4 of the amounts.
