If  any one has some upscale, low fat recipes out there I would appreciate you  sending them to the list.  Thanks, Eric *  Exported from  MasterCook II  *  Combine onion, olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon rosemary, garlic, and orange peel in  a 13-x 9-x 2-inch baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 400? for 10 minutes or  until onion begins to brown, stirring once. Stir in tomato and capers; bake  5 additional minutes or until mixture thickens. Stir in orange juice and  pepper. Add halibut to tomato mixture; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon  of rosemary. Spoon tomato mixture over halibut; bake, uncovered, 10 minutes  or until fish flakes at the edges when tested with a fork. Dont over cook,  if fish is slightly underdone in the center dont worry it will continue to  cook in the sauce. This is especially true if it is held a short amount of  time before service. Remove and discard orange peel. Sprinkle with olives  and serve. Yield: 2 servings.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.
