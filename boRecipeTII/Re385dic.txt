Adapted from More Lean & Luscious by Bobbie Hinman & Millie Snyder    Dry chicken breasts and saute til brown on both sides in as little oil as  you can get away with (when I make this for company, I usually use a little  more oil). Remove from saute pan and set aside. In a small bowl, mix lemon  juice, mustard, garlic powder, pepper, orange juice concentrate, dry  chicken broth, parsley flakes; add to pan, scraping off bits from bottom of  pan and bring to low boil. Add chicken and cook, turning frequently, until  chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover and  cook 10 more minutes. Keep an eye on this; it will need more liquid; I keep  adding orange juice.    This makes a "creamy" sauce that is yellow and probably looks like it has  butter in it. If you make it for Shabbat and it needs to heat up for an  hour or so before dinner, heat it up on low temp in oven and add more  orange juice.
