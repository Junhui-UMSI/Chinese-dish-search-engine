From: kathy@col.hp.com (Kathy Lankford)    Date: 15 Dec 1993 15:46:30 GMT  Another recipe from my favorite cookbook, Betty Crocker 1950.  This is a  very late reply to S. Havelsons request.  You can make these in 60 minutes  if you work VERY fast and they rise quickly.    Mix all ingredients.  Knead.  Roll out to 12" x 7" rectangle.  Prepare (see  below) and place in a 9" round pan.  Let rise 25-30 minutes.  Bake 20-25  minutes at 400 degrees.    For orange rolls: Mix ingredients.  Spread the dough rectangle with half  the mixture. Roll up the long way and cut 12 rolls. When baked, frost with  the rest of the mixture.    For cinnamon rolls: Spread rectangle with butter.  Sprinkle on sugar and  cinnamon.  Roll up the long way.  Cut 12 rolls.  When baked, ice with the  mixture of 1 Tbs butter, milk and powdered sugar.    For pecan rolls: Use the same butter, sugar, and cinnamon topping as for  cinnamon rolls, and roll up the same way.  Before placing them in the pan,  Coat pan with 1/4 cup melted butter, brown sugar and pecans.  Put the rolls  in and bake. Turn them out onto a cookie sheet immediately as they come out  of the oven.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    WITH VARIATIONS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
