In a large pot, combine dates, butter, sugar, and egg.  Bring to a boil,  stirring constantly over medium heat.  Cook for 10 minutes, continuing to  stir.  Add vanilla and rice krispies, mixing well.  Allow to cool until you  can handle it.  Roll into small balls, then roll in cocunut (or powdered  sugar if desired).
