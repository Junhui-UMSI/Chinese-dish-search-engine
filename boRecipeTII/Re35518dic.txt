1. Preheat oven to 350 F.    2. Place strawberries in a dish and sprinkle with a little sugar. Beat  current jelly & pour over them.    3. In the top part of a double boiler, melt the butter over boiling water.  Stir in the flour. Cook a few minutes then stir in the milk. Cook about 5  minutes stirring constantly until all is blended into a smooth sauce.    4. Remove top part of double boiler from heat and let cool. Add beaten egg  yolks and stir until the mixture is smooth. Add the pureed raspberries.  Sweeten with 1 tbs. sugar, if necessary. Set aside to cool about 15  minutes.    5. Beat the egg whites. Sprinkle in the cream of tartar while beating and  beat until stiff, but not dry. Add a little of the egg whites to the  raspberry sauce. Return mixture to remaining egg whites, lifting and  folding gently until just blended. 6.Heat the sliced strawberries and place  in the bottom of a buttered, sugared 2 quart souffle dish. Pour the  raspberry sauce over. Bake in preheated oven about 25 minutes, until well  puffed.    NOTE: In making souffles, it is very important to incorporate the egg  whites properly. They should be added to the sauce mixture when it is cool.  Do not overmix or egg whites will break down. Fold a small amount into the  cooked mixture first, then fold into the remaining beaten egg whites. Fold  in gently.
