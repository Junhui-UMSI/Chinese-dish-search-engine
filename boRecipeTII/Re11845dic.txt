Ray Bauers Swedish Rye Bread (Limpa)
Whole wheat or rye flour, Molasses or barley malt, (your choice will affect, Cracked wheat, Baking soda, Margarine or butter, (zest), High gluten bread flour, Dry yeast, Cumin seeds, The taste - I prefer wheat), Gluten (IMPORTANT!), Buttermilk powder, Caraway seeds, Grated fresh orange peel, Fennel seeds, 
THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT!    Combine the first 7 ingredients (using FRESH seeds only!) in 1 1/3 cup of  boiling water and soak for 1 hour minimum. (This pre-soaks the cracked  wheat and pre-releases the other flavors.)    Dump this concoction into a bowl and add the remaining 6 ingredients.    Set your bread machine to White and bake at the medium setting...    Manual -- do the normal knead and rise tricks.  Bake at 350 F for 30 - 35  minutes.  (test this since oven temps. vary)    Makes 1 loaf    Contributed by Ray Bauer Hacked into MM by Wesley Pitts especially for the  FIDO Cooking Echo
