Trout with Cream and Honey Sauce (Irish)
Lemon juice, Whole almonds, skinned, Flour (seasoned to taste), Butter, Fresh heavy cream, Trout, Honey, Milk (to soak trout in), 
Chop the almonds finely.  Prepare the fish, wash and dry and then soak in  milk for 5-10 minutes.  Toss in seasoned four. Melt half the butter in the  frying pan, and fry the fish for 5-7 minutes on each side. Make the sauce  by melting the rest of the butter, adding the chopped almonds. Saute for a  few minutes. Then add the honey and lemon juice; bring carefully to  simmering point, and add the cream last, making sure the temperature is  fairly low so it wont curdle. Pour over the fried fish, and serve  garnished with lemon.
