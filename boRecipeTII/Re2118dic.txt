Apple Strudel with Cinnamon Sauce
Granny Smith apples; peeled,, Apple cider, Cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, Raisins, Honey, Cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, Sheets phyllo dough; partly, Vegetable oil spray; (PAM), CINNAMON SAUCE, Arrowroot or cornstarch, 
STRUDEL: Preheat oven to 400 F. Mix sliced apples and raisins with  sweetener (I used 2 Tbs. frozen apple juice concentrate); sprinkle with  cinnamon and nutmeg. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo on a greased cookie sheet. Spray  phyllo with vegetable oil or a mist of water. Lay another sheet of phyllo  on top of the first one, spray with oil or water and place a third sheet on  top.    Place half of apple mixture on phyllo and roll up lengthwise, turning in  the ends to enclose filling. Cut 3/4 of the way through the roll to make 7  servings. Repeat procedure with the other 3 sheets of phyllo and the  remaining apple mixture. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned.    SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan. Whisk thoroughly. Heat  to a boil, stirring constantly.    TO SERVE: Separate strudel slices with a sharp knife. Top with warm sauce.    Note: I did not slice strudel - and baked it about 35 minutes. Next time I  would chop apples instead of slicing thinly.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Richard M. Swanson" <sharpy@sedona.net> on Oct  26, 1998,
