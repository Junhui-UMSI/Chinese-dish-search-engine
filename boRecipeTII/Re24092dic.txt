Recipe By : La Parilla the mexican grill by Reed Hearon    This mild, citrusy red spice paste can transform the blandest of foods. It  comes from the Yucatan, where it typically flavors Pibil-style suckling  pig. The pig is rubbed with the recado, wrapped in banana leaves, and then  cooked in a stone-lined pit until the meat is so tender it falls off the  bones. Grilling is a less traditional, but no less delicious, method. Use  for meat, fish, and poultry. Purchased achiote paste saves a good deal of  time and makes a less complex but acceptable recado.    Put the annatto seeds and water in a small saucepan and place over high  heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower heat to simmer. Cook 30 minutes.  Remove from heat and let steep 2 hours, or until softened.    Pan roast the garlic and onions until brown and soft.    Drain the annatto seeds and put into a blender or food processor along with  all the remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Keeps, tightly covered,  up to 5 days in the refrigerator.    Makes about 2 1/2 cups.    Posted to bbq-digest by "Garry Howard" <garry@netrelief.com> on Apr 15,  1998
