http://www.goodcooking.com/Cornbeef.htm    Open the package of corned beef and rinse under cold water. Place in a pot  with 1 sliced onion, the carrot and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and then  reduce the heat and simmer for two hours, partially covered. Remove from  the pot and place in a baking pan on top of two sliced onions. Combine the  ingredients for the baking mixture and mix well. Pour the non-alcoholic  beer over the corned beef then, place the baking mixture over the top of  the corned beef and cover loosely with aluminum foil and place in a  pre-heated oven at 325 degrees F for 1 1/2 hours. Uncover during the last  half hour and begin basting with the pan juices. Check for tenderness and  if necessary cook a little longer until the desired doneness is achieved.  You may also want to briefly place the    roast under a broiler to crisp it up. Remove from the pan and place on a  serving platter and keep warm. Place the juices in the baking pan in a  sauce pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook until slightly  thickened, like maple syrup. Slice the roast across the grain of the meat  and serve with the reduced sauce and your choice of accompaniments.    =A9 1997 by Good Cooking, Inc. Recipe by Chef John J.
