Venison Roast #1
Chopped green onion, Chopped parsley, Salt and pepper to taste, Fat from cured ham or use, Chopped bell pepper, (4 to 6 lb) venison roast, Garlic, 
Bring meat to room temperature. With sharp knife make deep holes across  grain of the meat. Mix salt; pepper, garlic, onion, pepper and celery;  insert in holes; then with fingers push as much of fat or fat meat into  holes as possible.     This is best when cooked in closed charcoal cooker for several hours or to  your preferred doneness. There is no need to baste meat as it comes out  moist, not dry as venison usually does.
