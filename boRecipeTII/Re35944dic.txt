Stuffed Pasta Shells with Spinach and Ricotta
Fresh spinach, Whole milk mozzarella, Whole milk ricotta cheese, sundried tomatoes, Garlic, fresh basil, Salt and pepper, Egg, Pasta shells, olive oil, Spaghetti sauce, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Preheat oven to 375F. Wash and drain spinach. Remove thick stems. Place  spinach in a pot with just the water clinging to the leaves. Cover and cook  until spinach wilts. Drain in a sieve.   When cool, squeeze dry and chop  medium-fine.      Mix spinach, cheeses, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, basil, salt and pepper.  Stir in egg.    Boil pasta shells until still slightly underdone, about 10 minutes. Drain  and transfer to a bowl. Toss with oil.    Spread spaghetti sauce in a baking dish just large enough to hold the pasta  shells in one layer. Fill each shell with about 1-1/2 tablespoons of the  spinach mixture, then arrange in dish filling side up. Sprinkle with  cheese. Cover and bake 45 minutes.   Serves 4 or more.
