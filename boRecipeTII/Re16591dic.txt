Aioli
Egg yolks, olive oil, Garlic cloves; mashed, Vinegar, Salt, Fresh Lemon Juice, 
Beat eggs until very thick and lemon colored. Beat in mashed garlic and  salt. Beating constantly, add olive oil VERY SLOWLY -- literally drop by  drop. After about half the oil has been added and the mixture is  thickening, add vinegar and lemon juice. Then continue adding olive oil  slowly, beating until a thick emulsion is formed.     Aioli may be used as a garlicky alternative to mayonnaise, but is  delicious on its own as a sauce or dip for seafood or vegetables.
