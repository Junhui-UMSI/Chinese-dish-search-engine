Stuffed Cherry Peppers
olive oil, Proscuitto, Hot cherry peppers, Provolone, 
Slice off top of peppers & remove core & seeds.    Stuff with provolone & prosciutto.    Pack in olive oil.    Just another thought, you would probably want to add some vinegar to the  stuffing if they are to be stored more than a week.
