Soak dried mushrooms. Slice roast pork, celery, cabbage and bamboo shoots.  Blanch bean sprouts. Stem snow peas. Shred ginger root and crush garlic.  Heat oil. Add ginger root and garlic; stir fry to brown lightly. Add pork  and stir fry a few times. Then add in sherry to blend. Add all vegetables  except snow peas and stir fry 1 minute more. Add stock and heat quickly.  Then cook,covered, 3 minutes over medium heat. Stir in snow peas. Combine  mixture with tossed noodles (*See below) Variations: Substitute cooked  beef,ham, chicken, duck, crabmeat, lobster or shrimp. You can also add  shredded green onion to the garlic/ginger mixture. I use Shaoxing wine  instead of sherry, which is more authentic. *To cook noodles, prepare  boiling water with a little salt. Add noodles and cook until barely done.  Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking. Separate noodles with a  fork, then toss them with a little sesame oil or peanut oil and set aside  until they are ready to go into your stir-fry for the final heat. You will  want about a pound of noodles for the above recipe. This recipe is simply a  guideline for a dish that can be varied in a thousand ways!
