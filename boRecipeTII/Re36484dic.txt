Beered Onion Rings
All-purpose flour, Green flakes, onions, Dark German beer, Vegetable oil, salt and pepper, 
In large bowl, mix flour, beer, salt and pepper into a batter. (Similar  recipes suggest 1 cup flour and 1 cup beer.) The thicker the batter is, the  more "crunchies" youll end up with.     Add enough green flakes to please your eye. These will not change the  taste one iota! They just add a pleasing appearance. Skip them if you want.     Let batter sit at room temperature for 3-4 hurs to let beer "work". Slice  onion 1/4-inch thick and separate into rings. Heat oil to 375 degrees. Dip  a few rings at a time into batter and fry until golden brown. Drain on  paper towels. If you can keep everyone out of the kitchen while you cook  them, they can be kept warm in a 200-degree oven until serving.     NOTE: Leftover rings can be frozen and reheated in a 400-degree oven.
