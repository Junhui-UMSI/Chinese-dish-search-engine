Pink Vodka Cream Sauce
Butter, Grated Parmesan cheese, Vodka, Pear tomatoes, Crushed red pepper, Heavy cream, 
recipes are from _The Encyclopedia of Sauces for Your Pasta_ by Charles A.  Bellissino, c. 1994. Ive tried a few of his recipes and theyre not too  bad--the big problem with the book is that ITS ALL IN CAPITALS and to a  net geek like me I "hear" the recipe at very high volume.    1. Stir the red pepper into the vodka and let it sit while you put the  pasta on to boil.    2. Melt the butter, add the vodka, and bring to a boil.    3. Add tomatoes and cream, return to a boil. Reduce heat and allow to  simmer for five minutes.    4. Toss cooked pasta with cheese, serve with sauce.    Suggested types are tube types, although it sounds quite tasty for anything  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #020    From: Pat Gold <plgold@ix.netcom.com>    Date: Thu, 12 Sep 1996 05:23:22 -0700
