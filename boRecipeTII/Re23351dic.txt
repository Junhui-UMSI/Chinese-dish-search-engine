FISH, tuna steaks, Wasabi paste *, butter, fresh dill, SAUCE, Fresh lime juice, Soy sauce, fresh coriander, Vegetable oil, black peppercorns, Scallions, 
* Available at Japanese markets and some specialty food shops.    Prepare grill.    Arrange tuna steaks in one layer in a shallow dish and lightly brush both  sides with oil. Spread peppercorns and dill evenly on both sides of tuna  and marinate for 20 minutes.    Grill tuna on an oiled rack set about 5 to 6 inches over glowing coals 3  minutes on each side for medium-rare fish. (Alternatively, grill tuna in a  preheated oiled well-seasoned ridged grill pan.)    Serve tuna with sauce.    Make sauce while tuna marinates: In a heavy saucepan combine scallions,  coriander, lime juice, soy sauce, and wasabi paste and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, lifting pan from  heat occasionally to cool mixture and adding each new piece before previous  one has melted completely. (Do not allow sauce to simmer. Sauce should not  get hot enough to separate.)    Serves 4    From Saltimbocca, in Vancouver, British Columbia.
