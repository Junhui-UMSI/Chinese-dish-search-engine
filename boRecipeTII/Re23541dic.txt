Arroz Con Leche (Rice Pudding)
Evaporated milk, For the Pudding:, cinnamon, Sugar, Ground Cinnamon, Water, Rice, Scaled milk, Raisins, long-grain white rice, 
Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a medium saucepan.  Remove from heat, and  add rice.  Let stand for 20 minutes.  Rinse rice well, and drain.  Bring 3  quarts water to a boil in another saucepan, and add rice.  Boil uncovered  for 30 minutes or until rice is tender.(Some rice will take considerable  less time.) Be careful not to overcool. Drain off excess water. Mix scalded  and evaporated milk, sugar, and cinnamon in a medium saucepan. Cook for 45  minutes or until mixture begins to thicken and changes color. Add rice and  raisins.  Cook for 40 minutes or until pudding thickens. Remove from heat,  and stir occasionally until pudding cools thoroughly. To serve, spoon rice  pudding onto a platter, and sprinkle with cinnamon. The pudding can be  cooked until it is very thick,if desired.  It also can be shaped into  patties and dipped in beaten eggs and rolled inbread crumbs before frying  in oil and butter until light brown.  The patties are rolled in cinnamon  and sugar before serving. Chanteclairs note - my long grain rice would be  mush if cooked that long, and it isnt converted. I would suggest that if  you just cooked rice the way you normally do (but more al dente). The long  cooking process is to partially caramelize the sugar in the pudding. I  suggest you lightly caramelize the sugar before you start - or maybe cheat  and use brown sugar. I have had this recipe - prepared the tradtional way -  and it was delicious.
