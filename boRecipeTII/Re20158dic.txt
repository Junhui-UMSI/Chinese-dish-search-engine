Vanilla Sugar
Moist vanilla beans, Sugar, Plump, 
Flatten the vanilla beans and cut them in half lengthwise.  With a small  spoon, scrape out the seeds and place them in a small bowl; reserve the  seeds for another use.  Combine the pods and the sugar in a jar. Cover  securely and set aside at room temperature for several days to scent and  flavor the sugar. Use in place of regular sugar when preparing desserts.  Vanilla sugar can be stored indefinitely.  As the sugar is used, replace  with new sugar.  (When baking, I return rinsed and thoroughly dried pods to  the sugar mixture as an added boost.)
