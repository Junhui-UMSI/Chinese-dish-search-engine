Pollys Cheese Squares
Cayenne pepper, Onion powder, Dill seed, Jars (5-oz) Kraft Sharp and, Loaf sandwich bread, Loaves white bread -or-, Tabasco sauce, Brau monda, Margarine, 
Soften margarine; cream adding one jar of cheese at a time. Add remaining  ingredients and mix well. Remove crusts from bread; cut each slice in half.  Spread cheese mixture on each piece. Stack 3 pieces of cheese-spread bread  together and put cheese mixture on sides, top and bottom so that all the  bread is covered. These cheese "petit fours" may be frozen at this point  until ready to bake or they may be baked immediately on an ungreased cookie  sheet at 350 degrees until they brown lightly (10 to 15 minutes).     Note: Put toothpicks through the center of the squares to keep them from  slipping while baking. Serves 8 to 10.     This recipe is great for a ladies luncheon (2 per plate plus a good  salad). You can do all the work well in advance...and just put them in the  oven the day of the party.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
