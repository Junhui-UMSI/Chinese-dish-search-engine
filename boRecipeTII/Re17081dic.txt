He published two leather bound cookbooks that we received as a gift and the  following is from one of the volumes.  I cant think of a better way to  utilize leftover turkey...    Thanks Lindy for this wonderful submission to The Kountry Kitchen.  I only  have one of the volumes from this wonderful actor and gourmet cook. Now  that I know there were two...  Ill be looking!
