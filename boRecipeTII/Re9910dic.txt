Punjabi-Style Garam Masala
Ajowan seeds, Green cardamom pods, Cinnamon, Black peppercorns, Ground ginger, Ground nutmeg, Coriander seeds, Cloves, mace, Cumin seeds, Bay leaf, 
A little of this warm, spicy blend goes a long way. Coming from North  India, where meat is eaten more frequently than in the South, it is the  kind of masala thats popular as an accompaniment for almost any meat dish,  as a condiment or in the sauce.    Grind toasted ingredients with mace, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon, and bay  leaf, and mix well with the other ground ingredients.    * Source: Lord Krishnas Cuisine: The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking *  (by Yamuna Devi) * Published in: The Herb Companion - February/March 1993 *  Typed for you by Karen Mintzias
