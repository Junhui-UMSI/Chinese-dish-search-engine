Divide avocado slices evenly over the bottoms of  the hamburger buns. Drain salmon and break into chunks. Divide evenly over  avocado slices, and sprinkle with remaining lemon juice. Top with second  halves of the buns, then with cheese slices. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Broil about 8 inches from heat until cheese melts and the sandwiches are  heated through. Garnish with dill pickles.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
