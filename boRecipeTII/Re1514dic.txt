Brining Ribs
Apple cider, Water plus a beer; (to make, Kosher salt; or more, Molassas; or more, Finely ground black pepper;, Decent shake or two of red, Maple flavoring, 
I only let them brine 6 hours.    I cooked them on my WSM starting with an initial temp of about 200 using  oak and cherry wood for smoke. After an hour I opened the vents and let the  temp come up to 250-275 and held it there. Took them off about 3      1/2    hours later.    To paraphrase Kit...... Boys and Girls, these were some absolutely  EXCELLENT ribs.    To be sure, brined ribs cant be called "traditional"..... but to be  honest!!! with everything thats been said by the various NC, Texas and  Georgia boys, Ive kinda lost interest in "traditional".........    I only hope some of you guys who have a lot more expertise and imagination  than I will experiment and report back.    Posted to bbq-digest by Terry Light <lightt@erols.com> on Dec 01, 1998,
