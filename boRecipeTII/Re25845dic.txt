Baby Wipes From the Tightwad Gazette
Bounty, Water, Baby shampoo, Baby oil, 
Cut roll of towels in half so that you have 2 short rolls; remove cardboard  center. Mix liquids in a plastic container (such as an old baby wipes  container). Place one of the half-roll paper towels into container; put lid  on tightly; turn container upside down to let towels thoroughly soak. When  ready to use, pull towels from center of the roll. busted by sooz    Recipe by: Key Gourmet    Posted to recipelu-digest by sooz <kirkland@gj.net> on Mar 19, 1998
