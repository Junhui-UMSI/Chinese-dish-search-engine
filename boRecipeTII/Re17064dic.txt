MAKES 1-1/2 CUPS DRESSING      This is easy to prepare and keeps for several days in the refrigerator. I  prefer to use whole spices and herbs and grind them up when I need them.      Place the dry ingredients in your food blender or medium- sized food  processor. Using the metal blade, grind for a few moments. Add the liquids  and whip to an emulsion, or until it is thick. Store in refrigerator for at  least    1-1/2    hours before using.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
