Combine chicken and water in stockpot.  Add celery seed, peppercorns and  garlic tied in cheesecloth. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer  for about 45 minutes. Remove chicken from broth and let cool.    Strain broth and return to pot.  Add tomatoes, onion, green pepper,  cilantro, cumin, cayenne, white pepper and garlic. Cover and simmer 30  minutes.    Add corn and green onion.  Simmer 10 minutes.  While this is cooking, skin  and bone the chicken pieces and cut the meat into bite-size pieces. Add  salt to taste. Add the chicken, rice and parsley to the broth, and heat  through.    Garnish each bowl with a few crisp tortilla chips (homemade are best, or  those made in a homemade style) and some grated cheddar cheese.    NOTES:    *  A spicy soup with cheese, tomatoes and corn -- This is a recipe from  Salmagundi, a San Francisco soup restaurant chain.    *  I usually make this with leftover chicken.  You dont actually need a  whole chicken worth, even a small amount will do. In this case, I use a  mixture of chicken broth and water (about 2/3 chicken broth) for the  liquid.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  2 hours, most of it simmering.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Vicki ODay  : Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto CA  : hplabs!oday    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
