Antipasto Platter with Prosciutto and Melon
BH&G HOLIDAY APPETIZERS 97, Thinly sliced prosciutto, Lettuce leaves, Melon balls or cubes, Fresh pineapple cubes, Slivered almonds, toasted, olive oil, White balsamic vinegar, Crumbled blue cheese, 
Roll up each prosciutto slice and arrange on a large lettuce lined serving  platter.  Place fruits and nuts around prosciutto. Combine olive oil and  balsamic vinegar and drizzle mixture over all. Sprinkle with blue cheese.    (This really looks pretty in the picture.  The prosciutto is rolled more in  a fan shape, rather than actually rolled up into cylandrical rolls.)
