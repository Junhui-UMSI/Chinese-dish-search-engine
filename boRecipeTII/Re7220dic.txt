In a food processor or mortar, grind or pound together the coriander, black  pepper and garlic until the mixture becomes a paste. Turn the paste into a  large bowl and add the pork, shrimp, green onions, shrimp powder, fish  sauce, and beaten egg. Knead and squeeze the mixture throughly until all  the ingredients are completely combined and the mass has a paste like  consistency. Cover the bread slices with the pork/shrimp mixture to the  depth of about 1/2 inch, making sure the mixture is evenly spread to the  edges of the bread. Cut the bread into squares or triangles. Heat the oil  until almost smoking, or 375 degrees, in a wok and fry the bread pieces,  two or three at a time, introducing them into the oil meat side down, Fry  on each side until crisp brown and remove with a slotted spoon, shaking  well and draining over the wok before draining on dish lined with paper  towels. The pork toasts should retain no grease; this can only be achieved  by letting the oil come back to full temperature each time and draining and  blotting well. After frying each lot, place in a dish in a warm oven and  serve hot, garnished with coriander sprigs.    Thai Dipping Sauce:    **** I am not very fond of fried food so you can toast the bread, then  spread the mixture on and bake on high.    ****Ive used the above dipping sauce as a marinade on chicken-oh how  yummy!!! Marinade then throw it on the grill!!!    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 257 by david & janine whitting  <whitts@kic.or.jp> on Nov 15, 1997
