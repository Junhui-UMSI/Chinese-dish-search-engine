1. Wash and core apples, then remove a 1 inch strip of peel around the  middle of each apple.    2. Place apples in a 2 quart square baking dish.    3. Mix sugar, and spices in a small bowl.    4. Fill center of each apple with mixture and dot with      1/4    ts. butter.    5. Add enough water to baking dish to cover the bottom of the dish.    6. Bake uncovered, at 350=F8 until apples are tender. Baste with glaze  occasionally.    Serve warm, covered with some of the baking glaze and real whipped cream.    Tip:  MacIntosh or Granny Smith apples are great for this.
