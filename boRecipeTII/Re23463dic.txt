Turkey and Wildrice Burgers
Ground turkey (I used lean), Egg, salt and pepper, Cooked wildrice, 
I made these yesterday, copying the idea from a version available at our  local Byerlys Grocery stores (Minnesota).  Very simple, and the perfect  companion for sweet potatoes and gravy.    Shape into patties or balls.  Saute with onions.  Cook in 350* F oven until  done.
