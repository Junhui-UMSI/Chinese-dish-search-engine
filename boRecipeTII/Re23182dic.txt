Pour about 4 tablespoons of  melted butter over bread and mix in the cheese.  In a saucepan, over low  heat mix 1 tablespoon of butter with 1 tablespoon of flour, to make a thick  white sauce. Then stir tuna fish into white sauce. In a 9" baking dish line  the bottom with bread and cheese mixture. Pour tuna over this and then add  the peas. Add a layer of sliced tomatoes and sprinkle remaining bread and  cheese mixture on top. Bake at 375 F until the cheese is melted.
