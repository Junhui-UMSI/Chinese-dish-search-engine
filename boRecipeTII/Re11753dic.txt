I just bought this great vegetarian cookbook this weekend and I had the  chance to try these two recipes. They both were absolutely delicious and I  thought I would share them. Here is one. The second will come later - time  permitting!    serve with rolls and a green salad    1. Preheat the oven to 350    2. Cook the lasagne in boiling, salted water for 12-15 minutes    3. Plunge pasta into a bowl of cold water    4. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and fry the onion and garlic until soft    5. Add the eggplant, zucchini and peppers and saute until soft    6. Add the tomatoes with their juice and the tomato paste and simmer until  tender. It may be necessary to add a little stock at this stage    7. Season well and set aside    8. Make the white sauce by melting the butter in a small sauce pan    9. Add the flour and cook to a roux    10. Add the mild slowly, stirring constantly, bring to the boil and simmer  for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat    11. Grease a deep ovenproof dish    12. Layer the ratatouille and lasagne strips, starting with the ratatouilli  and finishing with a layer of lasagne    13. Pour over the white sauce and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the top    14. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes until golden. Garnish with parsley  before serving    Time: Preparation takes about 20 minutes, cooking takes 1 hour.    Variation: Three cups sliced mushrooms can be used instead of the eggplant.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Andralee Acone <AAcone@CLASSIC.MSN.COM> on  Jan 12, 1998
