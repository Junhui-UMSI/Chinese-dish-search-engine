Pizza Dough
Yeast, Water , Sugar, Salt, olive oil, Egg, Flour, 
I do not have any idea what "Chicago Style" is.  While virtually any bread  recipe will work as a pizza dough, this is what I use for two crusts:    Soften yeast in warm water for about 10 minutes.  Mix in ingredients  (except the flour) and combine well. Add flour all at once and knead until  a smooth dough is formed. If it is a bit sticky, then add a little more  flour. Let rise for an hour, beat down, roll out and spread ones choice of  toppings. If you are pressed for time, the first rising can be shortened to  15 minutes, but this is not recommended. MK
