Taiglach (Tayg - Lock)
Baking Powder, Walnuts, Filberts, Brown Sugar, Vegetable oil, Ginger, Honey, Eggs, Pecans, Unsifted flour, Salt, Nutmeg, 
I know you asked for an Italian cookie - but my Jewish cookbook has a baked  pastry that is very similar - its called Taiglach (Tayg - lock). This  recipe is from a cookbook called "We Remember Bubba!"    Combine flour, baking powder and salt; mix thoroughly. Add oil and eggs.  Knead to make a soft dough. Roll and twist dough into a rope formation.  (1/4" in diameter); cut into small, irregular pieces. Place pieces of dough  on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 350* for about 20 minutes, or  until lightly golden. Cool.    In a large saucepan, combine brown sugar with ginger, nutmeg and honey;  cook to hard-crack stage. Drop the pieces of baked dough into the honey  mixture; stir and cook 5 minutes longer. Add nuts; stir and cook an  additional 3 - 5 minutes.    Turn mixture out onto a wet surface and allow to cool until easy to handle.    With moistened hands, mound taiglach on a tray (in a pyramid), and cool.  Posted to T.nt (sdm-marked) - Prodigys Recipe Exchange Newsletter  by  UCJU31A@prodigy.com ( M BROOMER) on 9 Au, g 1997
