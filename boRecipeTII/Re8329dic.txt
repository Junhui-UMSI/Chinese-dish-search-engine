Potato Rice Pancakes
Brown Rice Flour, Unrefined Vegetable Oil, Eggs, Non-alum baking powder, Sea salt, Potato Flakes, Water, 
Mix dry and liquid ingredients separately; then combine and stir well.  Pour small amounts of batter onto a hot, non-stick griddle and bake.  Serve with syrup or gravy.    NOTE: this recipe does not work well for waffles.  The addition of eggs  gives them more the consistency of wheat flour pancakes.
