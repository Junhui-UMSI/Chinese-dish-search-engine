Arugula Salad
Garlic clove; peeled, Dijon mustard, Mixed lettuce leaves, Sweet red pepper, Arugula; stems removed, Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, Salt, Mushrooms; sliced, 
In a wooden salad bowl, rub garlic and salt into the bowl to season it.  Combine vinegar, mustard and olive oil; stir. Tear lettuce into bite sized  pieces, along with arugula. Add mushrooms and slices of red pepper. Toss  well and serve.    Ogden writes: "Italian restaurants often serve arugula on its own with a  strong garlic flavored oil and vinegar dressing. Mixed with milder greens  and a good dressing, arugula is less dominating."    Recipe developed by Ellen Ogden.  In "The Cooks Garden" catalog,  Spring/Summer 1994, Vol. XI, No. 1. Pg. 41.
