The meat pie or meat-filled pastry can be found in nearly every country in  the world as a main course. Although the names and seasonings shift with  the region, the recipes stay the same.    Today?s recipe from The Cook & Kitchen Staff at Recipe-a-Day.com is the  Russian version of a meat filled pastry. This holiday specialty from Russia  will make a great addition to your recipe collection!    To prepare the pastry dough, combine flour and salt and sift into a mixing  bowl. Using two knives, cut butter into flour to the size of peas. Add sour  cream and mix with a fork to form a ball of dough. Wrap dough in waxed  paper and refrigerate to chill for 1-hour.    To prepare the meat filling, saute onion in butter, then add the ground  beef and crumble into small pieces. Cook until browned. Add remaining  ingredients, less the raw egg. Mix well, then cool.    Divide dough in half and roll each portion into a 9 x 12-inch rectangle,  slightly less than 1/8-inch thick. Cut each rectangle of dough into twelve,  3-inch squares. Place a rounded teaspoon full of the meat filling into the  center of each dough square and fold over, to form triangles. Moisten the  edges of the pastry dough with water before pinching together to seal the  meat filling inside. Refrigerate for 30-minutes before baking.    Pre-heat oven to 375-F degrees. Set Piroshki on a cookie sheet, and brush  with lightly beaten raw egg mixed with 1 tsp. water. Bake for 20-minutes or  until golden brown. Serve warm.
