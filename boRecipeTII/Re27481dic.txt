Drop all but 1 cup of the crumbled tofu into the boiling water. Bring the  water back to a boil and cook for 1 minute.     Drain the tofu into a colander lined wiht a clean dishtowel. Run cold  water over the hot tofu to cool it off for easier handling.     Twist the dishtowel and press the tofu to squeeze out the excess water.  The pressed tofu should have a firm, ground-beef-like texture.     Put the pressed tofu in a bowl and add the remaining ingredients to the  pressed tofu and mix well (use your hands for mixing). Shape th emixture  into walnut-sized balls and place them on a well-oiled cookie sheet.     Bake at 350 deg for 20-25 minutes or until the balls are firm and brown.  Turn them over once during the baking if necessary.     Serve tofu "meat" balls with your favorite tomato sauce and whole wheat  spaghetti. Tofu "meat" balls freeze very well, so make more than you need.  They may be reheated by dropping them into a simmering sauce or stew.     From the files of DEEANNE
