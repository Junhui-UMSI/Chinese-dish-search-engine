Unusual kosher-for-Passover dishes break from tradition: By Joan Nathan  "Americas chefs have become trendsetters in creating unusual pairings of  Jewish food. Here are some examples:"    Crumble matzos and soak in warm water. Drain well in colander.    Grind pecans in food processor so that they still have some crunch to them.  Set aside.    Heat oil in skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute until  translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add drained matzos, matzo  meal, salt, broth and eggs and mix well. Fold in pecans and parsley. Cover  and refrigerate 2 hours.    Roll mixture into about 20 nickel-size balls. Drop into simmering chicken  stock and cook, uncovered, about 15 minutes, until they float. Makes about  20 matzo balls or 8 servings of soup.
