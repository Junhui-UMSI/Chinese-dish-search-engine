Beefy Tortilla Pinwheels
cream cheese, horseradish mustard, deli roast beef, Green onions, pimiento-stuffed, flour tortillas, 
Place unwrapped cream cheese on a paper plate. Microwave on high for 15  seconds or until softened. Combine cream cheese, olives and mustard in a  small bowl; mix well. Spread about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese  mixture over each tortilla. Top each tortilla with 2 slices of beef,  overlapping slightly. Place onion on one edge of tortilla, trimming onion  to fit the diameter of the tortilla. Roll up tortilla jelly-roll fashion.  Cut each roll in slices to serve. Makes 6 beef rolls.    NOTES : Note:  This recipe was designed to be done quickly and served  immediately. Tortillas will dry out rather quickly if left in the open. If  you are going to prepare these ahead of time, wrap each rolled tortilla  well in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for up to overnight. Just before serving,  unwrap and slice.
