Yorkshire Pudding
Eggs, Milk; (vit. D), Flour, 
Mix until incorparated.    Heat muffin pan in oven to 450* then pour rendered beef fat into each tin,  just enough to coat the bottom.    Let it heat for 2 minutes then pour batter halfway in each tin.    They cook in about 5-8 minutes...When the rise up & you see the hole in the  center & they are starting to brown take them out and eat right away...  They fall quickly!    P.S. I Love to soak up Beef Juices with them...(bad habit) I never know  when to quit!    Makes 12    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 467 by CuisineArt  <CuisineArt@aol.com> on Jan 6, 1998
