Kosher Dill Pickles
Cucumbers, Vinegar (5% acidity), Water, Salt (not iodized!), Fresh dill, Garlic, Mustard seed, Red pepper pods, 
Wash cucumbers.   Combine vinegar, water and salt.   Bring to a boil. Place generous layer of dill, 1/2-1 clove garlic and 1-1/2 tsp mustard seed in bottom of each quart jar.   Pack jar half full of cucumbers, add another layer of dill and fill to top with more cucumbers. Fill jars to within 1/2 inch of top with boiling liquid.   Put caps on jars, screwing the band tight.    Process 5 minutes in boiling water bath.   These pickles are very crisp. Jars can be packed with small, whole cucumbers, sliced for hamburgers or split lengthwise. You can use this recipe for pickled carrots or okra. A pod of hot pepper may be added if desired.    NOTE:  Get a book on canning if unsure about sealing and processing.
