Pinoccate (Pine Nut and Almond Paste Cookies)
Pine nuts, almonds, Egg whites, Plus, Superfine sugar, Salt, Vanilla, 
PREPARATION: In a food processor, process the almonds and 1 cup of the  sugar until they are finely ground. Add vanilla. Beat the egg whites with  the salt until they form soft peaks, beat in remaining sugar and gradually  fold in the almond paste.  Place the pine nuts in a shallow bowl and drop  the almond mixture by spoonfuls unto them, forming a small ball and rolling  gently to cover the surface with nuts.  Lightly butter a large cookie  sheet, dust with flour and tap off excess. Place cookie balls 1 inch apart,  flatten lightly with a moist fork. Bake at 400 F. for 10 minutes, or until  golden.  Makes 3 dozen.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #294    Date: Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:06:13 +0100    From: Mary Ellen <ldyspark@buffnet.net>
