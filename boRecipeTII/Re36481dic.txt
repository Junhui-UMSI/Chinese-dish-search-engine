In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add 1/2  small, finely chopped onion and saute until soft. Add 1 tablespoon  Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce and 1/4 teaspoon garlic  powder. Reduce heat to medium-low and add 1 1/2 pounds sharp Cheddar cheese  spread, a little at a time, allowing cheese to melt after each addition.  Gradually add 3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese and enough beer to thin dip to  desired consistency (about 1/2 to 1 cup).    Serve in a fondue pot or bread bowl. Serve hot as a dip or at room  temperature as a spread with bread cubes, crackers, new potatoes,  vegetables or sausage pieces. To facilitate dipping, offer bamboo skewers.
