White Chocolate Creme Brulee
Arrowroot, Evaporated skim milk, Egg, Sugar, White chocolate, Sugar, Egg whites, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk egg whites, egg and 1/4 cup sugar in a large  bowl until well blended but not stiff, about 1 minute.    In a heavy-bottomed, medium saucepan bring milk, 1/4 cup sugar and  arrowroot to a boil over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until slightly  thickened. Reduce heat to low, gradually add white chocolate and stir until  melted. In a slow, steady stream, add white chocolate mixture to the egg  mixture, whisking constantly.    Evenly divide the mixture among 8 4-oz ramekins or custard cups, arrange  them in roasting pan and add enough boiling water to the pan to come  halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until set in center, about 3  minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and cool ramekins on a wire rack.  Cover surface of ramekins with plastic wrap; refrigerate until very cold.    About half an hour before serving the brulee, heat the broiler. Evenly  sprinkle each serving with 1 tsp. sugar, and return the ramekins to the  roasting pan. Add enough water to the pan to come halfway up the sides of  the ramekins. Broil 3 in. from heat, rotating pan if necessary, 2 to 3  minutes, or until sugar is melted and a dark amber color. Cool the custard  in the water for 5 minutes. Remove from pan and serve, or refrigerate 20  minutes before serving, if desired.
