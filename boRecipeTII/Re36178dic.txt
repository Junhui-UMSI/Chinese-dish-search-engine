Place meat in crock pot.    Mix flour, salt and pepper and pour over meat;  stir to coat meat with flour.    Add remaining ingredients and stir to mix  well.    Cover and cook on low (200F) for 10 to 12 hours or high (300F) for 4 to 6 hours.    Stir stew thoroughly before serving.     To cook on the stove:    Mix the flour, salt and pepper together.  Coat meat with flour mixture.   In  a large fry pan, wok, or Dutch Oven, brown the meat in a little oil  (cooking a little meat at a time until all is browned). Place meat in a  large pot and add about 3 cups beef broth, Worcestershire, garlic, bay  leaf, paprika, carrots, onions and celery. Stir to mix. Cook over medium  heat until it comes to a slow boil, reduce to low and continue cooking (4  hours or so) until the liquid is reduced and meat is tender, stirring  frequently.    Add potatoes and continue cooking about another 30 minutes or  until potatoes are tender.  Do not use Kitchen Bouquet. If necessary, add a  little flour mixed with water to thicken.
