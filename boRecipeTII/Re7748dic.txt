Slice 2 packages (about 8 oz) of portabella  mushrooms into strips Mix in and marinate at least 1 hour.    Grill the mushrooms    Serve in warm tortillas with the works--sliced onions, peppers, lettuce,  tomatoes, non-fat yogurt cheese or whatever you like.    Note: these measurements are approximate so adjust to taste.  I tried this  with other mushrooms, but the portabellas were the best.    fatfree digest V96 #201    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
