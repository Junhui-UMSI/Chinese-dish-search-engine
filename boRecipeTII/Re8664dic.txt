Potstickers with Pork
Egg, Cornstarch, Green Onions, Ground pork, Salt, Pepper, Sesame oil, Clove Crushed garlic, Soy sauce, Rice wine or dry sherry, 
Mix all ingredients together, by hand, in a large bowl. Fill wanton  wrappers with approx.  1-1 1/2 teaspoons filling and press firmly in wanton  press. (I dont have a wanton press and it turned out just fine) Moisten  edges for better adhering.  Saute in Peanut oil on medium heat till bottoms  are golden. Add enough chicken broth to barely cover wontons. Cover and  simmer approx.  8 minutes. Serve immediately with some dipping sauce  consisting of: 2 parts soy sauce, 1 part rice vinegar, a little grated  ginger and some chopped green onion. Et viola!
