Dosa
Ordinary raw rice., Some Cooking oil or ghee, Commercial grade parboiled, Rice, Black Gram (Urad Dal), 
Method:- Soak rice and gram in adequate water overnight. Drain and grind to  a fine paste. Add water to obtain thick pouring consistency mixture. Before  making dosas, stir in salt. Heat hot plate or "tawa" .. which is a thick  shallow concave shaped frying pan and smear oil over it. Sprinkle a  teaspoon of water on the tava, and when it evaporates, wipe tava with clean  cloth. Pour a little dosa mixture in the tava and spread it like a pancake  .. as thin as you can. (With experience, one can get a very thin dosa)  Dribble a little oil along the edges of the dosa and smear a little over it  and let it cook for a couple of minutes till golden brown on the side in  contact with the tava. If the dosa is thin enough, it is not necessary to  cook the other side. Remove from heat and fold over as it is if sadha dosa  is required, or fill and fold over if masala dosa is desired. Serve hot  with coconut chutney and sambhar. (The plain rice imparts crispness to the  dosa) From: K N Date: 06-13-96 Cooking    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 28, 98
