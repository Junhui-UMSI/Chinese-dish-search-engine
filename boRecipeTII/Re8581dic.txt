To make the filling, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and saut=E9 the onion  and pimiento until they are soft. Add the shrimp and continue to cook just  until the shrimp turns pink. Stir in the minced parsley and set aside.    In a saucepan melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and stir in the  flour. Using a wire whisk, gradually stir in the milk. Cook over low heat  until the sauce is thickened. Stir in the shrimp mixture and correct the  seasoning. Cool to room temperature before filling the potato roll.    To prepare the potato roll, boil the potatoes until they are very tender.  Drain and mash them. Mix in the butter, 3/4 cup of the milk, the cheese,  parsley, baking powder, and flour. Lightly beat the egg yolks with the  remaining 1/4 cup milk and add to the potato mixture. Add salt and pepper  to taste. Beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks and fold them into  the potatoes. (This is a dish typical of Brazil which can be made ahead and  baked just before serving.)    Line a jelly-roll pan with foil and butter the foil well. Starting in the  center, spread the potato mixture on the foil with a rubber spatula. It may  not completely fill the pan. Bake at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes or  until the top is lightly browned. Remove from the oven and carefully invert  onto a damp tea towel. Cool for 5 minutes and then carefully peel off the  foil.    To assemble the rocambole, carefully spread the cooked potato with shrimp  filling, and, using the towel as a helper, roll up, jelly-roll style. Serve  warm, cut in 1 1/2-inch thick slices garnished with cilantro sprigs.
