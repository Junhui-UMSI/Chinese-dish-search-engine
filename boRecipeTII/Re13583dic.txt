Wild Cherry Cordial Bars
Shortening; butter flavored, Chocolate chips, Water, Light brown sugar; firmly, Wild Cherry flavored cake, Eggs, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 9 x 13 x 12 inch pan. Combine cake mix,  eggs, water, brown sugar and shortening in large bowl. Stir until  well-blended. Mixture will be thick. Stir in chocolate chips. Spread in  greased pan. Bake 375 degrees for 24 to 27 minutes or until toothpick  inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely in pan. Cut into bars.    I always add a dollop of whipped cream when I serve these with a Maraschino  cherry on top.
