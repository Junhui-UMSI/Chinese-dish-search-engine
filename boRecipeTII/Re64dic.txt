Kentucky Black Barbecue Sauce
Black Pepper, Tabasco sauce, A scant 1/4 teaspoon ground, Vegetable oil, Onion, Plus 2 tablespoons distilled, Plus 2 Tablespoons, Plus 1 teaspoon light brown, Lemon juice, Coarse salt, A scant 1/4 teaspoon ground, 
1. Heat the vegetable oil over moderate heat. Add the onion and cook for 5  minutes, or until onion is soft and light golden brown.    2. Add the remaining ingredient, and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.  (The sauce will thicken slightly.)    Anyway, since Cairn mentioned the Dean & DeLuca Cookbook by David  Rosengarten, I thought Id offer these recipes from his book. Of these  sauces, weve only tried the SOUTH CAROLINA STYLE BARBECUE SAUCE so far,  and it was terrific. My Atlanta sister says its authentic.    This is one of least known- but one of the most delicious- Southern  barbecue sauces. It is customarily served around Owensboro, Kentucky, where  the meat of choice is lamb. The following version is thin, vinegary,  dark...and loaded with the flavor of sweet spices, though its not particu-  larly sweet; It is, however, lip-tinglingly hot.
