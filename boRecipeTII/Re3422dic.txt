Pecan Caramel Bars Pt 2
See part 1, 
2.Tilt the bowl of tempered chocolate to form a pool near the edge of the  bowl. Drop a pecan caramel bar onto the surface of the melted chocolate.  Using a 4-pronged fork, gently press down until the bar is submerged. Sweep  the prongs of the fork over the top of the bar to remove some of the excess  chocolate. Slide the prongs of the fork underneath the bar and lift it out  of the chocolate. Level the fork and gently tap the bottom of the fork in a  forward circular motion, barely touching the surface of the chocolate. Tap  several times until very little chocolate is being pulled from the bottom  of the bar.    3.Lift the fork away from the surface of the chocolate and lightly touch  the edge of the bowl with the bottom of the fork. Hold the fork at a slight  angle and follow the curve of the bowl with it to remove any excess  chocolate left on the bottom of the fork.    4.Place the coated bar down on the upper right-hand corner of the silicone  mat and pull the fork away with a quick but gentle motion. Before the  chocolate starts to set, decorate the top of the bar with a pecan half.  Coat and decorate the remaining bars in the same manner, setting them on  the silicone mat in straight rows.    5.Let the coated bars set for at least an hour before removing them from  the mat or waxed paper. If desired, wrap the bars individually in gold foil  or clear cellophane. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for  up to 2 weeks.
