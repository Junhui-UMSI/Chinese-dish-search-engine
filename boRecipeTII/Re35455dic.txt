Here are the recipes for my menu: (All Courtesie of Frugal Gourmet Cooks  with Wine)    Cut the beef into 1 1/4 inch cubes. Cut the vegetables into 1 inch squares.  Put all the ingredients in a large stainless steel bowl and marinate for  about 2 hours, tossing occasionally.    Alternate the vegetables and meat on skewers. Broil until lightly browned,  about 15 minutes, turning once during the process.    Serve this with Pasta Bagna Cuada (p. ref), along with Pan-Fried Broccoli  (p. ref).
