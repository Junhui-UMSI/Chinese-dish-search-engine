Recipe by: Craig Claibourne - The New York Times Cook Book 1. Scald the  milk, add the butter and blend. Cool to lukewarm. 2. Sprinkle the yeast on  the luke warm water and stir until      disolved. 3. Beat the egg yolks and gradually add the sugar. Vigorously      beat in the whole egg.  Add the milk to the mixture, disolved      yeast, lemon rind and currants. 4. Stir in the flour and beat until  smooth.  Cover the batter and      let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about one hour.      Stir down. 5. Spoon into six individual well-greased baba molds or  small      custard cups, filling them two-thirds full.  Let rise, uncovered,      until the batter reaches the tops of the molds, about thirty      minutes.  Fifteen minutes before the babas are ready,      preheat the oven to moderate (350F). 6. Bake until a cake tester comes  out clean, about twenty      minutes.  Remove from the molds and cool on a cake rack.      If desired, wrap in foil and freeze. 7. Marinate the babas in hot rum  sauce several hours before      serving.  To serve, ignite two ounces heated dark rum in a      ladle and pour over the babas.
