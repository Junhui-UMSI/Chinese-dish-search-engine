Wash and pat dry the turkey. Using fingertips, carefully loosen the skin on each side of the top part of the breast to make a "pocket" between the skin and the meat.      With a fork, blend the butter with the herbs, salt, pepper and garlic. Divide the mixture in half and with fingertips, carefully slide half of it  under the skin on each side of the breast.      Spray outside of the breast with the vegetable spray. Season the cavity  area well with salt and pepper.      Place, with cavity down, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Roast in the center of a preheated 400F oven for 1 hour.      Reduce to 375F and continue roasting until thermometer inserted in thickest part of the meat registers 165 - 170F. The turkey breast should be a dark golden brown. Let sit 15 minutes before carving.
