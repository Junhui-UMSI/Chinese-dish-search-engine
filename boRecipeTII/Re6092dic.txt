From: med@cltr.uq.oz.au (Marion Diamond)    Date: Sat, 14 Aug 1993 05:55:01 GMT  My recipe takes about 20 minutes to cook, at 425-450 degrees, but it does  depend on the pan youre using - I find a ceramic pizza pan cooks the dough  much better than a tin pan, which can leave a soft bit in the middle.    Mix yeast into warm water. Leave the yeast 5-10 min to bubble and add to  the flour, with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix roughly in a bowl,  then put in the food processor, and process, adding a LITTLE more water if  it wont form a ball. Turn out in the bowl, which has had a teaspoon of  olive oil put in it. Roll the ball in the oil, cover loosely, and leave  until risen (depends on the weather, but I find an hour is enough).    Spread out in your pizza platter (ceramic if possible, see above), and it  will begin to rise again while you potter around the kitchen, finding  whatever ingredients are available to make fridge pizza.    Cook about 20 minutes - Ive never had any problem with anything burning,  except maybe the odd mushroom.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
