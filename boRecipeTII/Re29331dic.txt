This will work with other whole lean fish, including small rockfish or  farmed striped bass, and cuts or roasts of halibut or pink salmon. Adjust  the cooking time according to the thickness and density of the fish.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.    Rub a baking dish well with the oil, add the vegetables and whole spices,  and toss to coat them lightly with oil.    Arrange in an even layer. Rinse the fish well inside and out, pat dry,  season lightly with salt, and place on top of the vegetables.    Add the wine and 3 tablespoons of the stock. Make a loose tent of foil over  the tail of the fish and place in the oven.    Bake, rotating the pan once halfway through the cooking time, until a  skewer easily enters the thickest part of the fish, 25 to 30 minutes.    If you have an instant-reading thermometer, it should read 145 degrees F.to  150 degrees F.in the center near the bone. Transfer the fish to a warm  serving platter.    Strain the contents of the baking dish into a small saucepan; discard the  spices and vegetables. Add the remaining stock, bring to a boil and reduce  by a third. Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Swirl in the  butter if desired and pour over and around the fish on the platter.
