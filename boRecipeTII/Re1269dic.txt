This may be a little hot for some folks, so one may want to reduce the  cayenne a little...but thats the way they likeem out here. I believe the  brown sugar is a must, and when it caramelizes, it produces that rich dark  cherry-red color, plus it taste good!    After the ribs come off the pit, baste them with a quick coat of an old  Southern recipe for finishing sauce for an added deeper, richer, cherry  appearance, and flavor. Sauce should be more on the thick side, than thin.  Apply with a pastry brush 2 or 3 inches wide. Must be brushed on AS SOON as  the ribs come off the pit, not even 2 min. later...immediately. This lets  it burn in, and will give them a shinny, glazed appearance, and turns them  into an even deeper cherry-red color. I love that color.    If the color is not deep enough, add more brown sugar.    Recipe by: Danny Gaulden    Posted to bbq-digest by "Glenn Manning" <gmanning@ionet.net> on Nov 6,  1998,
