Abm-Eggnog Bread
Butter, All-purpose flour, Eggnog; at room temp.*, Active dry yeast, Salt, Sugar, Nutmeg, 
I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for  the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may  need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with  it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too  dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in the  microwave) Place ingredients. in the B/M according to your  manufacturers directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as  needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of  my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness  or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a  Welbilt). Let me know your results, we sure enjoyed it!
