This week I still could find very good Quince. This compote recipe came  from my Grandmother. When ever my father eats it,he start talking about my  Grandparents with so my love. ( My father is 93 years old,but he is another  story which I think Ill tell you one of those days.)    As you know I grew up with he stories about them. My father fell in love  with my mother when he was 15 years old. He was an orphan at the age of 8,  so it become so natural that my Grandparents like adopted him. He absorbed  a lot from them, like. When ever the family sit for dinner , my Grandfather  would never allowed to start eating as long as my Grandmother is not  sitting at the table. This custom continue at my parents home, and still at  our home too.    Source: From my mother with love & more. Family recipe.
