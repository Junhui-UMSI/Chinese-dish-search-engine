Stuffed Artichokes Italian Style
artichokes, Soft Italian bread, Fresh parsley, Romano cheese, Salt and pepper, garlic, olive oil, Salt, 
Soak 6 med. artichokes in cold water 1/2 hour. Stand on counter and trim points off leaves with scissors and cut off bottoms so they will be flat to sit in pan. Then, standing artichokes upside down, give them a firm whack  so that leaves will open slightly to put stuffing in. Combine all ingredients with enough oil to moisten bread mixture. Stuff inside of  leaves. Place stuffed artichokes in a pan of water ( about 1 1/4 cups water ) to which 1 tsp salt and 3 crushed garlic cloves have been added. Sprinkle more oil over artichokes and simmer slowly for 45 minutes or tender.
