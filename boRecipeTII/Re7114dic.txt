Poppy Seed Sticks
Egg Yolks; Beaten, Salt, Poppy Seeds, Frozen Puff-Pastry; (17 1/4, Black Pepper, 
The dough for these sticks is easiest to shape when its firm. If your  pastry becomes too soft, place it in freezer until it has hardened again.    Heat oven to 425F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Dust a  clean work surface with flour, and roll each piece of puff pastry into a 10  x 14" rectangle, lass than 1/8" thick. Transfer the rolled-out dough to  baking sheets; refrigerate for 15 min.    Remove dough from refrigerator, and generously brush one puff-pastry sheet  with egg yolk. Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the sheet, then cover with  poppy seeds. Brush the second pastry sheet with egg yolk, and place on top  of first, yolk sides together. Gently press the two sheets together so the  poppy seeds stick between them. Return the pastry to refrigerator, and  chill another 15 min.    Remove the pastry from the refrigerator, and brush the top generously with  the remaining egg yolk. Using a pizza wheel or a long sharp knife, cut the  dough into 10" long strips that are 1/4" wide. Hold a piece of dough in the  middle, and start twisting in the direction of each end; twist until entire  piece of dough is tightly coiled. Transfer twist to a baking pan; press the  ends to metal. Repeat with the remaining dough.    Bake until the sticks are golden brown, about 8 min. Transfer to a wire  rack to cool completely, and store in an airtight container up to 1 week.
