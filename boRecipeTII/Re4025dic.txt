Cook syrup, sugar and butter together over low heat until the butter melts.  Stir until the crystals of the sugar are gone, and allow to cool.  Stir in  the cream. Mix the spices, baking powder and most of the flour into the  mixture. Stir the dough together and sprinkle the rest of the flour over.  Let the dough sit in a cool place until the next day. The best place is a  cold room or the basement; if you put it in the refrigerator, take it out a  few hours before baking. Knead the dough a bit until it is elastic.    Roll out to about 3-4 mm thick.  Cut with cookie cutters.  Large shapes  should be pricked here and there with a fork so they hold their shape  during baking. Bake at 175C for about 10 min.
