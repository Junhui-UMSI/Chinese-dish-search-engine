Popcorn Balls 2
Light corn syrup, Popped popcorn, salted or, Cider vinegar, Sugar, Vanilla, Unsalted butter, 
In a saucepan combine sugar, corn syrup, and vinegar. Attach a candy  thermometer to the side of the saucepan making sure that the bulb is  submerged but not touching the bottom. Cook the mixture over medium high  heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Continue to cook, uncovered, without  stirring until the temperature registers 260 F, or alternatively, until a  hard ball forms when a bit of the mixture is dropped in cold water. Remove  pan from heat and stir in vanilla and 4 tablespoons butter.    Pour mixture over popcorn in a large buttered bowl and stir to coat. Use  remaining butter to coat hands and shape the popcorn into balls and  transfer to a parchment or wax paper-lined sheet pan. When the balls have  hardened, individually wrap them in plastic wrap, colored plastic gift wrap  or wax paper and secure ends with colorful ribbon.    Yield: 1 dozen 2" ball  Recipe By     : COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8747    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #265    Date: Mon, 28 Oct 1996 10:03:35 -0500    From: "Angele and Jon Freeman" <jfreeman@netusa1.net>
