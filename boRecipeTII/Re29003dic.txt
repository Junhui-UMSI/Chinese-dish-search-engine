Cloves, Cinnamon, Sugar, Pears; halved and cored, Red wine (I use merlot), 
From: pcapone@husc8.harvard.edu (Patricia Capone)    Date: 22 Dec 93 17:45:49 GMT    I like to microwave them in red wine sauce, then serve with cinnamon ice  cream.    1. Microwave (HI) the wine, cinn, cloves, and sugar for 1.5 minutes    2. Place pears in baking dish    3. Pour heated liquid over pears.    4. Cover tightly and microwave (HI) for 12 minutes.    The pears can sit until ready to serve. They stay warm for over 1 hour.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
