Directions: 1. Melt butter over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed saucepan or  stockpot. Add onion, garlic, celery, and curry powder and cook, covered,  until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.    2. Add plum tomatoes and their juice, stock, basil, and brown sugar and  bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, partially covered, for 1-1/2  hours.    3. Remove solids and place in a food processor or blender with sun-dried  tomatoes. Process until completely smooth, gradually adding remaining  broth.    4. Slice cherry tomatoes and float a few slices on top of each serving.    VARIATIONS:    Omit the sun-dried tomatoes, in which case youve made Double Tomato Soup.  Cream of Triple Tomato: Decrease the chicken stock by 1/2 cup and add 1/2  cup heavy cream or sour cream just prior to serving. For a lower calorie  and fat version use l/2 cup buttermilk or nonfat yogurt. Omit basil and  curry and replace with l/4 cup chopped dill.

He wanted       something that tasted great but had the familiarity of Campbells."
