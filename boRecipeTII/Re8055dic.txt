Potato and Sausage Stew
celery, Carrot, Onion, Potatoes, Thyme, Peeled tomatoes, Butter, Italian sausage, 
Place the shortening, the chopped vegetables and the herbs of your choice  in a large heavy-bottomed pan with a couple tb of cold water. Cover with  lid and cook over low heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Add tomatoes (or  tomato sauce, or tomato paste), potatoes, sausage and some cold water (2  cups approx). Stir gently, in order not to "break" the sausage pieces.  Replace lid and cook on low/medium heat, stirring occasionally, until  potatoes are very tender. Adjust seasoning, adding some salt and pepper if  you like. Test for consistency according to your tastes, adding some hot  water if you like the stew to be more "soup-like". Serve with  steamed/boiled vegetables or some fresh salad.
