Revised after testing Feb 94.  Used 1 1/2 cup flour NOT 2 1/2 cups as  printed in the book.  The 1 cup beans probably replaced 1 cup flour  in the original recipe.    Stir dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.  Cut in butter until  mixture resembles crumbs.    In food processor or blender, puree beans with milk.  OR mash beans  and stir in milk.  Stir into dry ingredients all at once to make  light soft dough.    Turn out onto lightly floured board, sprinkle with flour and knead  about 20 seconds.    Shape biscuits by rolling, patting and cutting or divide dough into 16  pieces and shape by hand.    Bake at 400 F for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.    1 biscuit - 162 calories, 1 1/2 starch, 1 fats & oils exchange 4 grams  total fat, .8 grams saturated fat, 0 cholesterol, 5 grams protein, 26  grams carbohydrate, 169 mg sodium, 204 mg potassium.
