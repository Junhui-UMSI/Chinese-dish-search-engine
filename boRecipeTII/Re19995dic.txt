Vaguetarian Chili Recipe
See instructions, 
DAY ONE: (though I hate them on principle, electric stoves seem to simmer  better, and simmering is pretty much all I do with this, which necessitates  the extended cooking time . . .)    FIRST: dice three large onions (red, yellow, & white) and throw in large  pot with enough water to cover them. HEAT but dont boil. Add three cans of  beans (large red [kidney], small red, & black) but be sure and drain off  the gross water theyre canned in. Add a small can of tomato paste.    THEN: chop up all the chile peppers you can get. Go for variety in color  and size. Its easy in D.C., what with all the markets catering to speakers  of Spanish. I use the seeds, too. Cayennes, Anaheims, little purple hot  ones from my garden, the "Thai bullets" when I can find em, Jalapenos,  Habaneros, whatever. Just lots.    ADD chopped carrot, chopped tomato, celery.    SPICE with generous quantities of ground cumin, black pepper, cayenne  powder, cilantro, and basil.    COOK for a long time.    DAY TWO: KEEP cooking. (A thick brown broth should spontaneously generate  itself at some point. I believe its the beans, and thats why I dont use  meat -- the beans seem to do such a good job on their own, and I really  cant stand chili thats mostly just a paste of ground beef -- Id rather  have a cheeseburger.)    ADD 1 tablespoon of butter, the juice of a lemon, and a tablespoon of brown  sugar. I dont know why, just trust me. It adds something that people cant  ever seem to identify, and takes a little bit of the pain out of the sting  of the peppers.    Its ready when yr hungry, and it keeps nicely for the rest of the week.  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #183    From: "Sean OBrien/TA Staff/Internal/Tax Analysts/US"    Date: 10 Dec 96 17:09:55 EDT
