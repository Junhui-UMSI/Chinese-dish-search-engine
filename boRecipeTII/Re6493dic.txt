Place chicken in kettle and  add the stock, and veggies. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 1 1/2  hrs or until chicken is tender.    Remove chicken from broth and discard seasonings. Remove trussing string  and place chicken on platter (or cut into serving pieces) I like to present  the whole bird.
