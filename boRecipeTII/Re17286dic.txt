Source: Eat More, Weigh Less Cookbook by Terry Shintani pg. 179 - 1995  edition    Note: The recipe didnt specify which kind of miso. It seems it would be  dark miso for this recipe. Wakame is a tender Japanese seaweed. All  ingredients can be found at an Asian market if you are unable to locate  them.    Soak wakame and mushrooms in 1 cup of water until soft and cut into 1"  pieces.    Saute onions in 1/4 cup of water. Add water from the soaked wakame and  mushrooms and the rest of the water. Bring to a boil, add the wakame and  mushrooms and cook over low flame until it is tender.    Add miso to taste by diluting 1 to 2 TB of miso in a ladle full of the soup  water, mashing and smoothing out the miso and adding it back to the pot.  Leftover grain or noodles may be added if desired. Add other vegetables if  desired. Makes 6 portions.    1 portion: Cal 23, Fat .3, Protein 16%, Carbo 73%, CFF 12%.
