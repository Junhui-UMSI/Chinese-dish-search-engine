Baking Powder Biscuits
Bag; (5 lb.) self-rising, Lard, Sugar, Water, (1 qt.) dried milk, 
Mix the first three ingredients well using a large shredder. Shred the  shortening into the dry mix. Use a pastry blender and cut shortening into  fine particles*. Add 6 cups water and stir - turn out on floured board (use  part of dry mix as flour). Knead several times. Roll out 1/2-3/4 inch  thickness. Cut out and place on ungreased cookie pan. Bake at 450 degrees  for 15 minutes or until nicely browned - makes 5 dozen.    This mixture can be made up and stored in large container. Measure out  amount needed for biscuits, dumplings, etc., and add liquid as needed. The  more moisture you can use the lighter your biscuits.
