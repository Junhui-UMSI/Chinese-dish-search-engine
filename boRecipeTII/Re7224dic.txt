This recipe was from the L.A. Times. We rate our recipes A,B or C depending  on ease of prep, similarity to others, and quality of the end product. This  one rated an A- because it is great, but it does take some work.    Combine orange juice, beer and tomatillos in large saucepan.  Cook over  medium heat about 20 minutes.    Heat peanut oil in large skillet.  Add garlic cloves and cook 2 minutes.  Stir in 1/2 of cubed pork and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Brown  pork on all sides, remove pork with slotted spoon and add to tomatillos.  Cook remaining pork in skillet. Remove pork and garlic and add to  tomatillos.    Pour off all but 1/4 cup oil in skillet.  Add onions and lightly brown. Add  to tomatillo and pork mixture.  Mix in tomatoes, jalapenos, crushed red  pepper, and cilantro.  Cover and cook over low heat 2 hours.  (Chili can  also be baked in 350-degree oven for 2 hours.) Add beans. Cook uncovered,  1/2 hour more. Adjust seasonings to taste.    Serve over rice, or with warm flour tortillas, garnished with sliced  avocado, sprigs of cilantro and Lime Sour Cream.  Makes 6 servings.    Lime Sour Cream:  1/2 cup of sour cream mixed with grated zest and juice of        1    lime.    PS: To all who collected the tomatillo chile recipe: We made the chile last  night and I want to add something to the instructions. Before you add the  beans _and_ the liquid, check the chile to see if it needs more liquid.  Last night we drained the beans. Another time we made it, it needed the  extra liquid. It depends on how juicy your vegies are. Save the liquid and  add during the last half hour to correct the texture. I also added more  jalapenos and some cayenne to taste.
