Cold Pasta Salad
Box twisted pasta; cooked,, Carrots, Big zucchini, Red onion; sliced thin, Bottle Italian Salad, 
Grate the carrots & zucchini on big holes of a hand grater. Mix everything  together and refrigerate. Can use low fat Italian dressing. You might need  to use more salad dressing, because the pasta will absorb it. Enjoy.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by HKS94@aol.com on Nov 29, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.
