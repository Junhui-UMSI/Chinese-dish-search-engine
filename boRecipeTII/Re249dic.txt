Lasagna Roll-Ups
Lasagna noodles, meat, Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, spaghetti sauce, 
Brown the meat, drain and cool. While noodles are cooking, mix the  chopmeat, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese together.  Lay noodles out flat and spread some of the cheese mixture over the length  of it - be generous! Roll up noodle, place seam side down in pan and  continue with rest of noodles. Lastly, pour the jar of sauce over all and  sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake for 30 minutes in a 350: preheated  oven.    NOTES : This may not be a "casserole" per se, but you can make it ahead  (even a big batch and freeze portions as it is easily doubled, tripled,  etc.) and just pop it in the oven when you get home.  I add a bit extra  cooking time when coming from fridge to oven, 10 minutes or so depending on  your oven.  My family loves this and it is so easy.  You can even change  the filling around a bit to add spinach or other favorites.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #976 by fundwell@excel.net on Dec 31, 1997
