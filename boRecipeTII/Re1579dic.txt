Cream 1 c. sugar and margarine: add one egg and flour. Spread dough to  thickness of a pie crust on a greased baking pan. (I used a "cookie" baking  sheet) Brush thoroughly with egg. Combine brown sugar, nuts, and cinnamon.  Sprinkle generously over dough. Bake at 325 degrees until lightly browned.  ( I went with 35 minutes.) Cool slightly and cut into squares or triangles.  Leave in pan until cool. Store in an airtight container.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by dsabraham@juno.com (Deena Abraham) on Oct  8, 1998,
