Basic Rice Pudding
Sugar, Salt, Rice, milk, Nutmeg, Butter, 
Wash the rice in several changes of cold water. Drain the grains &  dry them between sheets of paper toweling. In a heavy 1-1/2-quart  casserole melt the butter over low heat. Add the rice & heat it,  stirring constantly until the grains whiten. Do not let them brown.  In a saucepan combine the milk with the sugar & salt, & scald it. Add  it to the rice, stirring just long enough to blend. Let the milk  bubble for a few seconds. Remove the casserole from the heat &  sprinkle the top of the rice & milk with nutmeg. Cover the container  securely & set it in an oven preheated to 250 degrees. Bake the  pudding for 1-1/2 hours, or until it is firm & the grains of rice are  very soft. Serve warm or cold.
