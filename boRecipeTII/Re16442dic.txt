Wellington-Style Beef Tenderloin
Dried thyme, Dry white wine, puff pastry, Green onions, Beef tenderloin steaks, Cooking oil, Butter or margarine, Fresh mushrooms, Pepper, 
To thaw pastry, let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Or, thaw  overnight in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, if using the top loin steaks, cut  each steak in half crosswise.    In a large skillet brown tenderloin or top loin steaks in hot oil over  medium-high heat for 1 minute on each side.  Drain on paper towels.  Set  aside.    In the same skillet cook mushrooms and onions in hot butter or margarine  and, if desired, wine for 5 to 6 minutes or till tender and liquid has  evaporated. Remove skillet from the heat. Stir in thyme and pepper. Unfold  pastry and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll into an 11-inch square.  Cut into four 5 1/2-inch squares. Place some of the mushroom mixture in the  center of each square. Place a steak on top. Fold pastry over meat. If  necessary, trim pastry to within 1/2 inch of edge of meat. Reserve pastry  trimmings.  Turn bundles over.  If desired, cut small shapes from  trimmings; moisten with water and place on top of bundles. Bake bundles,  pastry side up, on a rack in a shallow baking pan.  Bake, uncovered, in a  425 F oven for 18 minutes. (Meat will be medium-rare.)    Note that these may be frozen prior to baking for up to 3 months. To serve,  unwrap and place, pastry side up, on a rack in a shallow baking pan.  Bake,  uncovered, in a 425 F oven for 30 minutes.  (Meat will be medium-rare.)  If  necessary, cover pastry loosely with foil during the last 5 minutes to  prevent overbrowning.    Recipe is from _Better Homes and Gardens Great Cooking for Two_.
