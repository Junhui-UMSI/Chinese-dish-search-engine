chicken, Black Pepper, garlic, Onion, Canola oil, water, Patis, Chayote squash, FRESH ginger, Fresh spinach, jalapenos, 
In a LARGE pot lightly saute the garlic in the oil until lightly brown. Add  ginger and onions, cook till onions turn translucent. Add chicken pieces,  mix well. Add patis and black pepper to mixture. Add at LEAST 10 cups of  water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat, cook until the chicken  is tender, about 45 minutes. When chicken is done, add the chayote squash  and the chiles, then return to a boil and cook over a medium heat for about  10-15 minutes until the squash is tender. Then, add the spinach on top of  the soup, cover and cook until spinach wilts, about 1-2 minutes. Serve with  brown rice, and the traditional Filipino way is to take one of the cooked  chiles out and put it in a small bowl with enough patis to cover, then  smash the chile up in the sauce. You then use the chile/patis mixture to  season, if its not salty enough. * This is easiest found in an oriental  grocery. The best brand is Rufina,  if you cant get that, Tiparos (from  Thailand) is OK. Submitted By RICHARD EIKENBURG Submitted By MARIE CULVER
