Tofu Salad Crunch Pitas
Black pepper, Salt, cucumber, Dried dill weed, Leaf lettuce, Vegetable oil, Tofu, Hard tofu, pita bread, celery, radishes, 
1. Stir fry tofu cubes in vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet until  golden and crispy, about 15 minutes.   Sprinkle with salt.     2.  Combine all ingredients except pita bread and lettuce. Cover and  refrigerate for one hour to blend flavors.     3.  Line pita pockets with leaf lettuce and fill with tofu salad.     To press tofu, cut tofu block into 2 or 4 equal pieces and lay on a plate  covered with paper towels or a clean dish cloth. Cover with more paper  towels or dish cloth. Place another plate on top and on top of the plate  put a heavy object. Let stand from 20 minutes to one hour, changing paper  towels as they become soaked.   The longer you press, the firmer the tofu will be.     Recipe by Shirley Wilkes-Johnson
