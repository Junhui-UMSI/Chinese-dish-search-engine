Zucchini Jam
Apricot Jello, Water, Sure-Jell, Crushed pineapple, Sugar, Zucchini-peeled and grated, 
Boil the zucchini and water until soft.  Add Sure-Jell and bring to a hard  boil.  Add sugar and pineapple. Boil 5 minutes. Remove form heat. Add  apricot Jello. Stir well. Pack in sterilized jars and seal.    I use the Sure-Jell Light and use only 3 1/2 cups sugar. This is an orange  colored jam and really tastes great...unless you dont like apricots or  pineapple!
