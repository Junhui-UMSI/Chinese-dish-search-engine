Sweet and Sour Corned Beef Brisket
Mustard, Margarine, Ketchup, Brown sugar, Vinegar, corned beef brisket, 
Note: If you buy regular already made corned beef, have the deli man slice  it thickly. Better yet, buy a fresh pickled brisket that you have to cook.  My friend does hers in the pressure cooker; I just cook it in a pot and  change the water once to cut down on some of the salt. To cut the fat down,  I buy only the lean first cut.    Bring to boil above ingredients and simmer til blended. After brisket is  cooled and sliced, lay in pan and pour sauce over all. Bake at 350 at least  1/2 hour til sauce is thick and clinging to the meat.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #332 by Mindi <myenta@psnw.com> on Dec 23,  1997
