(Again this is an Austrian recipe, so please forgive the sentence  structure).     Rinse the rice in a "hair sieve"- fine grid. Bring 800 ccm water to the  boil (just over a pint, from memory) and add the rice- cook 5 mins.  Turn  the heat to very low, place a lid on the saucepan, and cook until the water  is evaporated (about 40 mins.)     Cut the chicken into chunks, cut the onion into slices, and cut both the  white and green parts of the leek/spring onions in to slices.     Heat the butter/marge/oil, and brown the chicken one minute. Add the onion  slices and cook one minute, add the cashews and cook one minute, then add  the leek (or whatever) and cook one minute (surprise, surprise....)     Add the rice and toss through, then slosh in the Sherry, salt and pepper.     Serve with a green salad...
