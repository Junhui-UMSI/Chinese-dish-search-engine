A Little Something Extry
Green pepper, chopped, Coon, Shortening, Onion, Vinegar, Pepper, Salt, Flour, Sweet potatoes, Garlic, Water to cover, 
Dress the meat (hopefully it will come to you this way and you wont have  to do it yourself).  Soak fore one (1) hour in mild vinegar and water to  remove the gamey taste; drain. Cut the meat in serving size pieces as you  would chicken, salt and pepper the meat, cover with water. Add the  seasoning and boil until partially tender. Remove from the heat and drain.  Brown the meat in a small amount of shortening then place in a roasting  pan.  Make a thin brown gravy with flour and meat drippings; pour over the  meat.  Place peeled sweet potatoes around the meat and bake at 350 degrees  until the potatoes are done.  Good luck.
