Lamb racks, White bread crumbs, Fresh rosemary, Hazelnuts, salt and pepper, Dijon mustard, Honey, 
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine hazelnuts, fresh bread crumbs and  minced rosemary in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the honey and  dijon mustard.    Arrange the lamb racks meat side up in a single layer on sheet pans that  have been sprayed. Season lamb with salt and pepper. Brush each rack with 1  tablespoon of the honey-dijon mixture.    Press 2/3 cup breadcrumb mixture onto each rack. (Racks can be prepared  this far up to one day in advance.)    Drizzle each lamb rack with 1 tablespoon honey. Roast until meat  thermometer registers 125 degrees.    Racks must rest for at least 10 minutes before carving. Cut between each  rib bone to order to separate into chops.
