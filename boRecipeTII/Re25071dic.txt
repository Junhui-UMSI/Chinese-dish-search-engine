TO MAKE PASTRY: In food processor, combine flour, pinch salt and butter.  Pulse on/off turns til mixture ressembles coarse crumbs. While processing  is running, add ice water processing until dough pulls away from sides of  processor and forms a ball. Form dough into a dish shape. Wrap in plastic  wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 450F. Roll out pastry out  on floured surface to 14 inch diameter circle. Fit into 10 inch tart pan  with removable bottom. Fold in extra pastry along edge so sides of tart  will be thicker. Place tart pan on baking sheet. Line tart shell with  double thickness of foil. Fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake at  450F for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove foil and weights or beans. Cool tart  shell on rack. Reduce oven temperature to 400F. To make filling: Sprinkle  1/2 cup cheese in bottom of cool, prebaked pie shell. Cut each tomato in 5  slices. Seed tomato slices. Pat tomato slices dry between paper towels,  gently pressing to extract as much juice as possible. Arrange tomato slices  in pastry shell in single laye rover cheese. Set aside. In medium bowl,  whisk eggs, cream, mustard, 1/4 tsp salt and white pepper to taste until  blended. Pour over tomatoes. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese. Bake tart shell  on baking sheet at 400F for 35 to 40 minutes or till filling is puffed and  set in centre. Let stand 10 minutes before serving. YIELD: 6-8 SERVINGS    SOURCE: Victoria magazine
