The other night I was playing with my wok, throwing in food that I had in  the fridge.  What came out tasted surprisingly good.  here are approximate  ingredients:    Put the following into a bowl to marinate with Soy Sauce and Sherry: Bell  peppers strips, crushed or minced garlic cloves, chopped onion, Oregano (as  much as you like), Parsley Flakes (2 Tbs or more), Sliced Mushrooms, and  Scotch Bonnet Peppers.  Let marinate for at least 30 minutes.    Cook Noodles as directed on package.    Heat wok with a little oil (Mongolion Fire Oil, or stir fry oil).  Add Bowl  contents, whole thai peppers, and stir fry.  After about a minute or  so,  add some corn starch, and maybe some more sherry. After another minute or  so, Add a large squirt of Frenches Mustard. Things should take on a yellow  tint now. Add small can of Pineapples (Juice and all) to the mix. Let  simmer until sauce thickens (cover wok if possible-the thai peppers will  steam and have a softer, blended flavor). Spoon onto noodles and enjoy.
