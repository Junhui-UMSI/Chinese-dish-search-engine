Have a popover pan or muffin tin ready.    Combine the flour, eggs, milk, pesto sauce and salt in a food processor or  blender and mix until smooth.    Place the pan or tin in the oven and preheat it for 3 minutes. Remove it  from the oven and brush the inside of the cups with the melted butter.    Pour the batter into the cups, filling them almost to the top. (Popover pan  will yield six; muffin tin will yield ten.) Bake at 450 degrees for 25  minutes. Reduce the temperature to 375 degrees and continue to bake until  the popovers are well browned, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Loosen from the  sides of the pan, if necessary, and transfer to a wire rack. Serve  immediately.    If you dont have pesto, you can make them plain by using 2 tablespoons of  melted butter instead. Or spice up the plain version with 1/2 teaspoon each  of curry powder and ginger. There are lots of possibilities.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
