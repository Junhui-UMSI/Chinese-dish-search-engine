Tarragon Cream of Tomato Soup
Cream, Salt and pepper, White onions, Tarragon, milk, Sugar, Butter, Very ripe tomatoes, 
First peel the skin off of the tomatoes and slice into chunks. Mince the  onions into whatever size pieces you like and saute thin the butter until  they are soft but not brown. Put the tomatoes which in with the onions.  Cook for about 15 minutes. (Feel free to mash the tomatoes if you like a  less-chunky soup.) Add milk and cream. (If you dont have cream, using all  milk still works fine.) Add the sugar and salt and pepper to taste. Let all  of this simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. When its about  done, add the tarragon. Serve soup with sprigs of fresh parsley.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Crane C. Walden" <cranew@foothill.net> on Feb  6, 1998
