Eskimo Cookies
Evaporated milk, Sugar, Oatmeal; Old fashioned, (NOT, Powdered sugar, (12oz) chocolate bits, Margarine, OPTIONAL, Coconut, Pecans, 
These cookies are so rich, I only make them once or twice a year (at the  holidays). It is a recipe I got from my Grandmother. I dont know where she  got it. Also note, I modified my Grandmothers recipe. She used 3 cups of  sugar. Ive found that 1 1/2 works just fine. I suggest trying the recipe  without the optional ingredients first. I dont feel they add anything to  the recipe.    In a double boiler, combine first four ingredients. Stir until sugar is  completely dissolved and texture is smooth. While mixture is warm, combine  with oatmeal-use as much oatmeal as you can coat with the mixture. Roll  into balls and then roll in powdered sugar. Store in refrigerator and eat  cold.    Note: If you have trouble rolling the balls, allow them to cool some (in  the fridge is ok). Also, wetting your hands with cold water also helps.    Warning: Everytime you open the fridge door, you will want to eat "just  one." They can be hazardous to diabetics!
