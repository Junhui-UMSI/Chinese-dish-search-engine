Kolacky
Butter or margarine, Cream cheese, Vanilla extract, All-purpose flour, Salt, Thick jam, 
"Called cookies, pastries, or dessert by many purists, this sweet filled pastry is a favorite of many East Europeans.  Although kolackys are generally thought of as Bohemian or Czech, Poles in some areas prize the varieties of fillings for these pastries almost as much as the varieties of toppings for mazurkas."  Cream butter and cream cheese until fluffy.    Beat in vanilla extract.    Combine flour and salt; add in fourths to butter mixture, blending well after each addition.    Chill dough until easy to handle.    Roll dough to 3/8 inch thickness on a floured surface.    Cut out 2-inch circles or other shapes.    Place on ungreased baking sheets.    Make a "thumbprint" about 1/4 inch deep in each cookie.  Fill with jam.    Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes, or till delicately browned on edges.    Makes about 3 1/2 dozen.
