Clean, peel and chop into quarter-inch dice the peppers, onion and the  okra. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry hr garlic with the onion, peppers  and okra for about five minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook it gently for  about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally until you have a nice bright sauce.  It looks lovely as it is full of different colours.    Season generously with allspice, cayenne pepper, the salt and the black  pepper.    Add thr prawns. If they are raw, cook for seven minutes. If they are  already cooked and pink give them just three minutes to heat them through -  otherwise you will end up with a pound of india rubber!    Stir so the prawns are covered in the sauce, sprinkle with a little parsley  and serve immeadiately with lots of boiled rice.    Source: Michael Barry, yes! magazine
