Chocolate Angel Cake
Salt, Egg whites, Cream of tartar, Raspberries and nectarine, Unsweetened cocoa powder, Hot water, Granulated sugar; divided, Cake flour, 
1 Preheat oven to 350? F. In a medium bowl, combine cocoa and hot water.  Mix well; cool. In a small bowl, combine 3/4 cup of sugar, flour, and salt.  Mix well; set aside.    2 In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer set on high speed, beat  egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar; continue beating until soft  peaks form. Gradually add remaining sugar; beat until stiff peaks form.    3. Sift half of flour mixture over egg white mixture; fold gently until  combined. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture. Stir 1 cup of egg white  mixture into cocoa mixture. Gently but thoroughly fold cocoa mixture into  remaining egg white mixture until combined.    4. Spoon the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Run a small knife  through batter to remove air pockets. Bake until springy to the touch and a  toothpick inserted near center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.    5. Invert pan and place center tube over the neck of a bottle. Cool  completely. Using a knife, loosen cake edges. Invert the cake onto a  serving plate; garnish with raspberries and nectarine slices.
