Combine apples, quince and raisins in stainless-steel mixing bowl.  There should be about 8 cups fruit. Add sugar to taste, 1/4-1/2 cup,  depending on sweetness of fruit. Do not over-sweeten.    To make topping, combine in work bowl of food processor - or in  separate stainless-steel mixing bowl - 1/2 cup sugar, walnuts, flour  and salt. Stir to mix well. If using processor, add 2 tablespoons  butter and pulse briefly to mix. Add another tablespoon and pulse  again. If combination takes on consistency of moist sand, stop  processing. If not, add remaining tablespoon butter and pulse again.  If making by hand, follow same procedure, rubbing flour mixture and  butter between finger tips rather than in processor.    Pour fruit into buttered 13x9" baking dish and spread evenly.  Distribute topping by hand over top, breaking up large clumps. Bake  at 350F. 45-50 minutes or until fruit is tender and topping is  browned.
