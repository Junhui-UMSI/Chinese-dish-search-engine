*NOTE: Original recipe used 3 T extra virgin olive oil. It doesnt need  anywhere near that amount.    **NOTE: Original recipe used dried homemade bread crumbs... I did but you  can use store bought.    ***NOTE: Original recipe used Yukon Gold potatoes...I used half red and  half Yukon Gold.    ****NOTE: Original recipe used regular chicken broth    OTHER NOTES: The original recipe also called for: 2 T unsalted butter -- I  omitted it completely 1 1/2 C heavy cream -- I omitted it completely    In a large deep skillet, heat 1 T olive oil. Add the fennel, cover and cook  over moderate heat until fennel is wilted, about 6 minutes. Uncover and  cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and just caramelized, about 12  minutes. Season with salt and pepper and let cool slightly.    In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs with remaining 1/4 tsp oil.  Season lightly with salt and pepper; set aside.    Preheat the oven to 350 deg F and spray a 13 x 9" baking dish. Spread 1/3  of the potatoes in an even layer in the dish. Season lightly with salt and  pepper and top with 1/3 of the fennel. Repeat the layering with the  remaining potatoes and fennel, seasoning the layers and ending with the  fennel.    Pour the stock over the vegetables, rearranging the fennel if its  dislodged by the liquid. Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake for  about 1 hr, or until the potatoes are just tender; set a baking sheet  underneath the dish to catch any drips. Remove the foil, sprinkle the top  with the bread crumbs and bake for about 30 minutes longer, or until the  top is golden brown and the potatoes are very tender. Let the gratin rest  for 10 minutes before cutting.    MAKE AHEAD: The gratin can be refrigerated overnight. Rewarm, covered, in a      350    deg F oven before serving.    This is fabulous!!
