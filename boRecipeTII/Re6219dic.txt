Crust:    Pour  the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve the yeast with a  fork. Add 1 c of flour, all of the cornmeal, salt, and, and vegetable oil.  Mix well with a spoon. Continue stirring in the rest of the flour 1/2 c at  a time,  until  the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl. Flour your  hands and the work surface and kneed the ball of dough until it is no  longer sticky.    Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl, sealed with plastic wrap, for 45 to 60  minutes in a warm place, until it is doubled in bulk. Punch it down and  kneed it briefly. Press it into an oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza pan, until  it comes 2 inches  up the sides and is even on the bottom of the pan. Let  the  dough rise 15-20 minutes before filling.    Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.    While  the  dough  is rising, prepare  the  filling. Cook the crumbled  sausage until it is no longer pink, drain it of its excess fat. Drain and  chop the tomatoes.    When  the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over the  dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese. Top  with the tomatoes. Sprinkle on the seasonings and parmesan cheese.    Bake for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400  degrees and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the  crust from time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The crust  will be golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.    (From THE PIZZA BOOK, by Evelyn Sloman)
