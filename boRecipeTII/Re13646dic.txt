** See recipes for Beef Stock and Clarified Butter.         Soak cepes in Madeira and hot water to cover for 20 to 30 minutes.  Drain, reserving and training the liquid in which they were soaked.         Rinse and drain the cepes; chop coarsely.         In a saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat and  add cepes, onion and marjoram and toss for 2 minutes.         Add vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a 1/4 cup of reserved liquid.  Simmer for 5 minutes; set aside.         In a separate saucepan, melt the remaining butter; stir in the flour  and cook for 3 minutes.         Whisk in the stock and bring the mixture to a boil.         Add cream and carrot and simmer, covered.         Meanwhile, blanch potato in boiling salted water for 3 minutes; drain  and rinse under cold water.  When the carrot is nearly tender, add potato  and cook until all of the ingredients are tender (about 5 minutes.)         Add cepe mixture and simmer for 5 minutes.         Add lemon juice and adjust seasonings to taste with salt and white  pepper.         Add parsley and serve.
