The Chefs Swedish Meatballs
Eggs, Flour, Sour cream, fresh dill, Cornbread crumbs, Beef broth, Salt, Butter, Nutmeg, rind of 1/2 lemon, Ground veal, Black Pepper, milk, 
Combine the eggs, milk, ground veal or pork, and cornbread crumbs (we use  leftover cornbread or store bought cornbread muffins), salt and pepper.  Form into small (3/4 in., 2 cm) balls, to make about 4 dozen. Saute in  butter in a large skillet until browned and cooked through. Remove from  pan, reserving cooking juices in pan. Combine flour and sour cream and  blend thoroughly to remove lumps. Add broth to pan with cooking juices. Add  sour cream, nutmeg, dill, and grated lemon rind and stir over low heat  until slightly thickened. Add meatballs and heat 15 minutes, or until  meatballs are warm. Serve over noodles.    NOTES : This recipe was handed down from the Chefs Grandmother who,  frankly, didnt have a drop of Swedish blood in her veins. We cant say  that it is authentic, but we can say that it is delicious. Serve it over  noodles, and feel free to tell your guests that it is your Grandmother  Johansens recipe.
