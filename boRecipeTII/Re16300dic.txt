Watermelon Juice
Watermelon, chilled, 
Slice the watermelon lengthwise into slices 1 to 2 inches thick. Carefully  cut away the rind and discard.  Place as much flesh as will fit into a food  processor and process until smooth, about 15 seconds. Press through a fine  sieve and discard seeds and pulp. Pour the juice into a pitcher. Repeat  this process until all the watermelon has been blended and sieved. Chill  and serve cold.
