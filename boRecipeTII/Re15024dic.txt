West Indies Hot Curry Sauce
yellow mustard, Salt, White vinegar, mango, Curry powder, habanero (scotch bonnet), Ground cumin, Brown sugar, Chili powder, Black pepper, 
WARNING: Hottest sauce in North America. Use this to enhance dull and  boring food. Keep away from pets, open flames, unsupervised children, and  bad advice. This is not a toy. This is serious. Stand up straight, sit  right, and stop mumbling. Be careful not to rub your nose, eyes, or mouth  while working with habaneros. You may actually want to wear rubber gloves  while chopping and mixing -- these babies are powerful.    Mix all the ingredients together and stand back. This will keep, covered  and refrigerated, until the year 2018. Be careful though: If it spills, it  will eat a hole in your refrigerator. If you ever want to dispose of it,  call the local toxic waste specialists.    NOTES : This style of hot sauce, widely used in the West Indies, is  basically habanero peppers (also known as Scotch Bonnets), fruit, and  yellow mustard, with a few other ingredients thrown in. Use this recipe as  a guideline. Habaneros are at the top of the chile pepper heat scale, so  feel free to substitute other peppers of your choice.    Funnel the sauce into an old pint liquor bottle, then let your imagination  run free as to what whopper you can lay on your guests regarding its  origins. If youre having trouble, heres a start: "One day in Jamaica I  was in this dingy bar and met this old guy who..." and you take it from  there.
