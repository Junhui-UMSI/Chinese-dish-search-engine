Recipe for Leftover Ham
Orchestershire Sauce, Ground ham, Green onions, Slightly beaten egg, milk, Dry mustard, Bread crumbs, Aro light corn syrup, Red currant jelly, Ground fresh pork, 
Mix meat, crumbs, milk, onion, egg and a dash of pepper. Shape into a loaf.  Cook in a shallow baking dish.(I use the Deep Dish Baker) Bake 350 degrees  oven for 1 1/2 hours. During last 30 minutes, spoon on Tangy Mustard Glaze  as Follows: Combine last four ingredients and baste ham loaf with glaze.  Serve remaining sauce on the side. This is great for buffet lunches as the  ham loaf can be made in advance and heated before serving. I always serve  the cheesy sour cream potatoes with this dish.
