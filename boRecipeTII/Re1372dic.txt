These are 5 recipes that I formatted from  http://www.pbs.org/mpt/jewishcooking/. Joan Nathan did a 5 part series on  Jewish Cooking in America. Included with the recipes were actual photos of  the preparation.    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and cover a cookie sheet or jelly-roll pan  with aluminum foil. Season the fish well with salt and pepper and dredge in  the flour, removing any excess. Place the eggs in a flat soup bowl, beat  well and then dip the fish fillets in the egg. In a mixing bowl stir  together the horseradish, fresh bread crumbs or the matzah farfel, along  with the parsley. Remove the fillets from the egg and coat generously with  this mixture, patting the fish so it adheres well. In a large skillet over  a medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter and the oil. When the  butter begins to brown, add 3 of the fish fillets, flesh side down first.  After about 1 1/2 minutes, or when golden, remove the fillets to the cookie  sheet. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and repeat the procedure with  the remaining 3 fillets. You can do this ahead of time. Bake in the oven  for about 5 to 8 minutes or until cooked on the second side.    Sauce: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and wrap the beets in aluminum foil.  Roast for 1 1/2 hours or until very tender. Cool slightly, scrape the peel  off with a butter knife, and cut in large chunks. In a medium, nonreactive  saucepan melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the onion  and the cabbage. Lower the heat, cover and sweat until tender,  approximately 5 minutes. Add the tomato, wine, thyme, and bay leaf. Simmer,  uncovered, and reduce by half, about 5 minutes. Then add the fish stock,  the beets, and the potato.    Simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes are fully cooked, about 10 to 15  minutes. Remove the herbs and transfer the sauce to a blender. Puree until  smooth, approximately minute. Taste and then add the remaining 1 1/2  tablespoon butter, salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste and pulse for  about 15 seconds. At the last minute swirl in the sour cream, but do not  incorporate fully. You want to see that swirl. Spoon a puddle of sauce in  the center of the plate. Set 1 crusted fillet on top. Serve with  horseradish mashed potatoes by adding some prepared horseradish and chopped  dill to the mashed potato.
