Put turkey thighs on a chopping board; slice meat away from the bones. Cut  meat in 1-inch cubes, discard skin. Spray a non-stick pot (or pressure  cooker) with cooking spray for no-fat frying. Add cubed meat. Brown over  moderate heat in its own melted fat (no added oil needed). Remove from  flame and stir boiling water into juices in pot. Pour liquid into a cup,  set aside until fat rises to surface. With a bulb-type baster, skim off and  discard surface fat.  Return fat-skimmed liquid to pot. (Bones may be added  for flavor and removed before serving.) Add all remaining ingredients  except cheese.  Cover, simmer over low heat until tender, about 1 hour in  conventional pot, or 20 minutes in pressure cooker. Uncover, continue to  simmer until most of the liquid evaporates and chili is thick. Spoon into  serving dish.  Top with cheese. ~--
