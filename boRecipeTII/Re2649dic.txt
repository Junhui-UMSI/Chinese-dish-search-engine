Please stop laughing. You paid plenty for this book and I didnt write it  for laughs! This dish is really very good and the flavor of cheese and  peanuts is not new in American cuisine. Thomas Jefferson was very fond of  this sort of thing, Im sure. Read the hints first. Souffl?s are actually  very easy.      In a saucepan melt the butter and stir in the flour. Cook for just a few  minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the hot milk, using a wire whisk, and  return the pan to the heat. Stir until thickened. Add the salt, cayenne,  nutmeg, and peanut butter. Stir until all ingredients are well  incorporated. Remove from heat.      Stir in the egg yolks using the whisk. Stir in the cheese with a rubber  spatula and set aside to cool for a few minutes.      Beat the egg whites, along with the cream of tartar, until they are stiff  and form nice peaks. Very gently, very gently (No, this is not a typo) very  gently, fold the cheese sauce into the egg whites. Place in a 1-1/2- to  2-quart souffl? dish and bake for 25-30 minutes at 375?. Serve a minute  ago!      Serve as a luncheon dish or as a first course. HINT: RULES FOR A GOOD  SOUFFL?     1. Have the eggs at room temperature.     2. Be sure the sauce is not too hot when you blend in the        flavoring ingredients.     3. Fold in the egg whites; dont stir them in. Folding means        that you use a rubber spatula to gently roll the batter        over the egg whites in a circular or folding motion. You        dont want the egg whites to collapse.     4. Be prepared to serve it the minute it comes from the oven.        Souffl?s fall like two-year-old children...all the time.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
