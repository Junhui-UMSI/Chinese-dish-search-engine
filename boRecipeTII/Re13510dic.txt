Water, Whole wheat flour, Eggs, Walnuts, Salt, All-purpose flour, 1% low-fat milk, 
1. Preheat oven to 375?. Spray six 2/3 c popover tins or nine 1/2 c muffin  tins with vegetable oil spray.    2. In a food processor blend flours and 2 tbsp walnuts until walnuts are  ground fine.  In a bowl whisk together eggs, milk, water, flour mixture,  and salt until combined well but still slightly lumpy.    3. Divide batter among tins. Bake in lower third of oven 45 minutes.  Popovers will not rise as much as classic version because of walnuts. Cut a  slit 1/2" long on top of each popover with a small sharp knife and bake 8  minutes more.
