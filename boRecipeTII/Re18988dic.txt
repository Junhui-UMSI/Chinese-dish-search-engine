Here is the result,  We think it is  pretty good.  This recipe does not show quantities because it depends on  the number of eggs. If you make too much filling, boil some more eggs!    Peel eggs, cut in half and discard yolks.    Mix potato flakes, mayonnaise, and mustard to desired consistency. Add  chopped onions and a dash of Tobasco.    Add other seasonings to taste, such as curry powder or chopped chives.    A small amount of nutritional yeast will thicken mixture and contribute a  cheese-like flavor.    Let stand in refrigator about an hour.    Fill centers of boiled-egg halves.  Dust tops with paprika and garnish as  desired.  Chill and serve.
