Dougs Version of Mikes Potato Soup with Green Chiles
Olive oil; up to 3, Leeks; white part and a, Garlic, Cumin, Oregano, Potatoes; peeled and diced, Roasted; peeled Anaheims,, Chicken Stock, 
CLEAN the leeks, then cut into rounds. Put the oil in a pot large enough to  take the chicken stock plus all the rest, and add the leeks and the garlic,  cook for about five minutes until it is wilted, then add the cumin and the  oregano. Turn up heat and add the chicken stock and the potatoes and the  chiles, bring to a boil and cook at simmer for about 45 minutes. Taste for  seasoning, add freshly ground black pepper and either Calvins or Jims or  some other hot pepper flakes or powder or whatever you have that gives you  heat....this is terrific soup, it was when I did Mikes version, and it is  now with mine. Hey. Michael, try it and let me know which one is better!  Cheers, Doug in BC Notice the lack of salt....add your own to taste    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Oct  16, 1998,
