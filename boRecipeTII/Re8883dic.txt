1. Wash scallop shells and place on a cookie sheet. Preheat broiler.    2. Peel and devein prawns, then coarsely chop. Quarter bay scallops. In a  medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine shellfish and wine and heat  until bubbling. Cook until scallops are opaque (about 1 minute), stirring  constantly. Drain and reserve cooking wine. Set scallops and prawns aside.    3. In the same pan, heat butter over medium heat and sauteed mushrooms  until they begin to exude moisture. If mixture gets too dry and begins to  stick, add a small amount of reserved cooking wine. Stir in flour and cook  for 2 minutes.    4. Add milk in a thin stream, stirring constantly with a whisk. Sauce  should thicken immediately. If it doesnt, continue to cook over medium  heat, stirring, until it is the consistency of heavy cream. Add Parmesan,  scallops, and prawns, and remove from heat.    5. Spoon an equal amount of seafood mixture into each scallop shell. Top  with bread crumbs and broil until lightly browned and bubbling (3 to 5  minutes). Serve hot (see Note).    Note:  For easier service, fold a linen napkin under scallop shells to keep  them from tipping on the plate.
