Triple Bypass Cheese Biscuits
Cayenne; to taste, (hold, Plain flour, Lard yes lard. No subs., Strong cheddar, Salt, Pepper, 
Grate cheese and lard. Add seasonings. Beat until creamy. Stir in flour.  Pipe finger-length width biscuits onto ungreased trays. They dont spread  at all, so pack em in.    Cook at 200 degrees C for 15-20 minutes, or until they look done.    Notes: Use the strongest cheese you can lay your hands on. If it bends,  dont bother. I always use NZ epicure or equivalent. If all else fails,  substitute half with blue cheese (Stilton is nice for this).    Sounds fairly ordinary, right? (yummy bix, BTW) Anyone out there remember  Wizz Fizz? Take the finished biscuits and a jar of your favourite powder.  Use your imagination. (gotta get me some Calvins)    I used the mix I made from some yellow ajis, a few habs and a whole lot of  those orange ones they were selling at the festival down at Erina. (smell  just like tomato plants, what were they called again?)    This is so cool.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by "J. B. Cattley" <jbc@mpx.com.au> on Apr 18,  1998
