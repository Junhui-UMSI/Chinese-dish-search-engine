Aloo Gobhi Matar (Potatoes, Cauliflower, and Peas)
Cauliflower, fresh coriander, Potatoes, Ground coriander, Salt to taste, Ground cumin, Canola oil, tomatoes, Ground turmeric, Fresh peas, Cayenne pepper powder, 
Must be all the postings with great Indian recipes (and because the  cauliflower in the local supermarket looked superb) that we had this dish  tonight. As I remember, someone asked for more veggie Indian dishes, and  this is veggie, low fat, and delicious. The amount of spices is up to you  and your taste buds. Also, the recipe as given in the book is sort of  skimpy for 4, so I tossed in more cauliflower, more peas, more potatoes,  and double the amount of spices. Enjoy!

(depends on how fast you can chop)  Serves: 4    Cook the cauliflower, potatoes, and fresh peas, each separately, in boiling  water until tender. Drain and set aside.    Combine the turmeric, cumin, cayenne, and coriander powder in a small bowl.  Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet over moderate heat, and add the  spices. Cook for a few seconds to release the flavors. Add the cauliflower,  potatoes, peas, and tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes over medium to low  heat, and add perhaps a 1/4-cup of water if needed. Cook a bit more until  all is heated through, add salt and coriander leaves, and cook a few more  minutes. Serve with rice and enjoy!
