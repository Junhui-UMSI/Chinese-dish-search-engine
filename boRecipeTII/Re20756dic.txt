Apple Dumpling Sauce
Sugar, Water, Margarine, cinnamon hots, 
Mix all ingredients and boil together. Then turn heat down and simmer until  cinnamon hots melt. Pour over apple dumplings and bake together. The sauce  will be fairly runny at first but will thicken up nicely when baked. Hmmmm.  I think I just might have to make some of these tomorrow. Also, I dont  core my apples any more. I just peel and slice the apples.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Marietta J Slater <marietta2@JUNO.COM> on Sep 5,  1997
