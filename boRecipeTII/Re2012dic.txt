90 Minute Bread
Water, Packets of dry yeast, Salt, Sugar, Corn oil, Bread flour, 
Pour water into bowl and sprinkle yeast over it. Sprinkle sugar and salt  over yeast and wait until yeast bubbles and comes to the surface. Stir in  oil. Add 4 cups of flour all at once. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough  gathers together in a ball. Scrape down sides of bowl incorporating dough  particles. If dough is sticky, add additional flour until it can be handled  easily. Turn dough out into floured board and divide into two loaves. Shape  each loaf and place into greased bread pans and cover with a wet dish  towel. When bread has doubled in bulk, bake 375 degrees in preheated oven  for 30-35 minutes until brown. Turn on to a rack to cool.
