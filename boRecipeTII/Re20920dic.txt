This algo goes for someone (I dont remember who) who asked for  a r-e-a-l-l-y crunchy topping for a fruit pie posted some days ago. This  came from my favorite cookbook "Cafe Beaujolais", by Margaret Fox and John  Bear, Ten Speed Press. BTW, wouldnt you be interested in sharing the names  of your favorite cookbooks?    Mix together apples, lemon juice, lemon rind, and water (or the other  liquid you chose). Place in a buttered 9-inch round cake pan. Using an  eletric mixer at slow speed, blend sugar, butter, flour, oats, cinnamon,  ginger and nutmeg, until crumbly. Scatter evenly on top of apples. Bake at  350 degrees for 1 hour. Serve warm. Optional toppings: vanilla ice-cream,  whipped cream or Vanilla custard sauce.    EAT-L DIGEST 18 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
