The Best of Everything Baked French Toast
Walnuts, Sliced bread, Cream cheese, milk, butter, Maple syrup, Eggs, Vanilla extract, Brown sugar, Berries, 
Place butter, brown sugar and maple syrup in a dish that can go in the  microwave and in a conventional oven. Microwave until butter is melted  (about two minutes). Stir to dissolve sugar and mix ingredients well.  Sprinkle nuts over this mixture.    For one 9" x 12" pan:    Spread cream cheese on half of the bread slices. Place berries or apple  slices on this, then top with the plain bread slices to make a "sandwich".  Cut in half diagonally. Place in baking pan. Do not overlap slices.    Mix eggs, milk and vanilla. Pour over bread. Milk may have to be incresed  depending on dryness and density of bread.    Cover and refrigerate overnight. Bake at 350? for about 45 minutes,  uncovered. Flip over to serve, so the syrup side is up.    Can top with powdered sugar, fruit or additional syrup, if desired.
