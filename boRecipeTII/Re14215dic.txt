1. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll  the dough into a 14-inch circle. (For a thick crust, roll the dough into a  12-inch circle.) Coat a 14-inch (or 12-inch) pizza pan with nonstick  cooking spray. Place the dough on the pan, forming a slight rim around the  edges. 2. Place the ricotta and Parmesan in a small bowl, and stir to mix  well. Spread the cheese mixture over the crust to within 1/2 inch of the  edges. Sprinkle the mozzarella and provolone over the ricotta. Sprinkle the  cheeses with the scallions, olives, Italian seasoning, and fennel seeds. 3.  Bake at 450 degrees for about 12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and  the crust is lightly browned. Slice and serve immediately.
