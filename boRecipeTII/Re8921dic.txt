Preserved Duck Eggs (Thousand Year Old Eggs)
Fireplace ashes, Lime*, Salt, Ashes of charcoal, Tea, Duck egg, fresh, Ashes of pine wood, 
*Available in garden stores and nurseries.    Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg, thickly  coat each egg completely with this clay-like mixture. Line a large crock  with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top. Cover with more soil  and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to cure for 100 days. To remove  coating, scrape eggs and rinse under running water to clean thoroughly.  Crack lightly and remove shells. The white of the egg will appear a  grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk, when  sliced, will be a grayish-green color.    To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:    Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable    Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1  tablespoon minced ginger root.    Preserved Ancient Eggs        These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the preserving  process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased individually in Oriental  markets.        The description of the whites turning grayish isnt quite accurate from  the ones Ive seen. Theyre more a dark blackish amber color-- quite  attractive actually.        From "The Regional Cooking of China" by Margret Gin and Alfred E.  Castle, 101 Productions, San Francisco, 1975.        Incidentally, this is an excellent book. Its written by Maggie Gin of  commercial Chinese sauce fame. If you can find an early edition, get it.  The later editions have been integrated into her marketing strategies and  may not be as complete as this one is. They also call for whatever the  sauce ingredients are or "Maggie Gins Such and Such Sauce".                              per Stephen Ceideburg Submitted By SAM WARING  <SAM.WARING@382-91-12.IMA.INFOMAIL.COM>  On   MON, 20 NOV 1995 145845 GMT
