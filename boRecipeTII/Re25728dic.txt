Baba Ganoush
Eggplant, Lemon juice, Salt, fresh garlic, Sesame tahini, Chopped parsley, pine nuts, olive oil, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Prick eggplant all over with a fork. Bake  whole until tender (about 30 minutes).  Remove from oven, halve and scoop out the flesh.  Blend in a food processor with the lemon juice until smooth.  Mash the salt and garlic together and combine with the eggplant, along with the tahini.  Cool and stir in the parsley and pine nuts. Before serving, drizzle with the olive oil. Serve as a dip with tortilla chips or triangles of flat (pita) bread.
