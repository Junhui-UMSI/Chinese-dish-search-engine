The  bacon can be eliminated and oil used for frying if desired.    In a large skillet, cook the bacon over medium hear until it is crispy.  Using a sloted spoon, remove the strips of bacon to paper towels to drain.  Pour out and reserve the drippings. Cool and chop the bacon into 1/4 inch  pieces.    In a medium bowl, beat together the potatoes, egg, salt and pepper until  combined.Beat in two tablespoons of the reserved bacon drippings.  Beat in  the flour until combined. Stir in the chopped bacon. In the same skillet,  heat 1 tbsp. of the reserved drippings over medium high heat. Using a 1/4  cup measuring cup, drop the potato mixture onto the hot skillet.Cook for 3  to 4 minutes on each side, or until the scones are golden brown on both  sides. Drain scones on paper towels. Serve warm Makes about 7 scones.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
