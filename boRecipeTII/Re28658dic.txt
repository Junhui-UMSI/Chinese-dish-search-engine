Texas Fried Green Tomatoes
Salt, Green tomatoes, fresh, Flour, milk, Pepper, Eggs, Oil, 
Cut tomatoes into almost 1/2-inch thick slices. Mix flour, salt, pepper and  seasoned salt in one bowl. Mix eggs and milk in another bowl. Dip each  tomato slice into the milk mixture, then into the flour, back to the milk,  and then to the flour again...coating well. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350  degrees; add battered tomato slices a few at a time, and cook for 5  minutes, or until golden brown. Can also be cooked in a heavy skillet,  turning once. Note. Yankees can substitute cracker crumbs for flour;  Southerners can use cornmeal. In any case, adding a little flour will  improve coverage.    ..This version is from "American Home Cooking" by N.
