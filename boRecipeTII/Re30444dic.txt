Ive never tried this but I suspect that its quite similar to the Filipino  Jufran and Mafran sauces that I love so much.  Theyre made from bananas  also and taste like catsup *should* taste.    Combine the raisins, onions , garlic, tomato paste and 1/3 cup vinegar in  the container of a food processor., Process the mixture until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a large, heavy saucepan.    Add the banana chunks and another 1/3 cup vinegar to the food processor  container.  Process the mixture until smooth.  Transfer the banana mixture  to the saucepan.  Add the remaining 2/3 cup vinegar, 3 cups water, brown  sugar, salt and cayenne pepper.    Bring the mixture in the saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring  frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and cook the ketchup, uncovered,  stirring occasionally, for 1 1/4 hours.  If the ketchup threatens to stick  to the bottom of the pan at any point, add some of the remaining water, up  to 1 cup.    Add the corn syrup, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper and cloves to the  ketchup.  Cook the ketchup over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, for  15 minutes longer, or until it is thick enough to coat a metal spoon. Stir  in the rum. Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool a few minutes.    Force the ketchup through a fine sieve to strain it, pressing down hard on  the solids.  Remove the ketchup from the heat and let it cool to room  temperature.  Store the banana ketchup, covered in the refrigerator for up  to 1 month.    Makes about 3 1/2 cups.
