Veggie Loaves
Garlic, spinach, Vegetable stock, Bread crumbs, Carrots, Egg whites, Onion, Mushrooms, Celery seed, Cauliflower, Pepper, 
Cook onions and garlic in stock until tender. Add mushrooms and cook 2-3  more minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Cool. Place in  blender with spices and egg stuff and blend.    Wash the spinach, and cook for 2-3 minutes in the pan that cooked the  onions. Steam the cauliflower and carrots; mash them seperately.    Combine spinach, 1/3 mushroom mixture, 1/3 breadcrumbs. Repeat with  cauliflower and carrots, keeping them seperate. (I also add some salt here;  the cauliflower and carrots seem to need it.)    Put the 3 mixtures in the loaf pan(s) in whatever order you want to see the  colored layers. Bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes, until its firm. Serve hot  or cold.    Yield: 2 little loaves (individual loaf pans, I think theyre 3x5?). Double  the recipe to make one regular loaf, and bake it for closer to an hour.
