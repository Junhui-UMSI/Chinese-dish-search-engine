Cook on high all day, 8-10 hours. You know  this is done when the meat can be pulled apart with a fork, and its  stringy. Add a little brown sugar and vinegar to taste. Serve on burger  buns or hot dog buns. I prefer the hot dog buns, less messy.    EAT-L DIGEST 24 MAY 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
