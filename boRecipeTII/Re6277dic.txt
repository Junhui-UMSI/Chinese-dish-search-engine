Plain Flan
Recipe condensed milk, Recipe caramel, Eggs, Half-and-half, Sugar, Egg yolks, Vanilla bean, Vanilla extract, 
Prepare the caramel and coat a 9-inch round cake pan, reserving the extra  caramel sauce in the refrigerator as directed above. Preheat oven to 325  degrees. In large mixing bowl gently whisk together eggs, egg yolks, 1/2  cup sugar, vanilla extract and half-and-half. Whisk together without  incorporating any air. In saucepan pour condensed milk. Split vanilla bean  lengthwise and, using tip of a paring knife, scrape seeds into the milk.  Add the bean and bring to a boil. Once milk has reached a boil, pour into  egg mixture, whisking continuously, until fully combined. Pass through a  strainer into the caramel coated cake pan. Place inside a large roasting  pan and pour hot tap water into the roasting pan until it rises halfway up  the sides of the flan. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, until the  center feels firm when pressed. Set aside to cool in the pan of water. Once  cool, remove from the water bath, cover with plasticwrap and refrigerate 4  ~ 6 hours or overnight. To serve, run a knife along the inside of the pan  and gently press the center of the bottom to loosen. Cover with a platter,  invert and lift off the pan. Excess caramel can be drained from the cake  pan and added to the reserved caramel sauce. Cut in wedges and serve topped  with cold caramel sauce.
