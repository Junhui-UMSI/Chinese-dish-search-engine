Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a large bowl, mix sugar and oil.  Add  pumpkin and eggs.  Blend well.  Then, add flour, spices, and water.  Mix  completely.  Pour into two, well-greased loaf pans.  Bake for 1 1/2 hours.    Note:  I have a gas oven that gets really hot, so I dont let my bread cook  for the whole 1 1/2 hours.  I check it after an hour (just press the top of  the loaves - if they spring back their done or use the toothpick test).    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
