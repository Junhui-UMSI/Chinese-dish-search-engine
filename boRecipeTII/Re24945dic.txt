Warm 3 tablespoons of the oil in 8-quart Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add chicken in batches so pan is not crowded. Cook 15 to 20 minutes per  batch, or until browned on all sides. Remove to large plate.    3. Warm remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in same pan over medium heat. Add  leeks; cook 5 minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring to scrape up  brown bits.

While chicken cooks, make dumpling batter (recipe follows).    Dinner Plan: Before adding dumplings, remove 1/2 of stew to microwaveproof  container; cool, then freeze for later use.
