Featherlight: Separate the eggs into two bowls. Beat the whites until stiff. Beat the yolks and salt until light. Combine the beaten yolks with the stiff whites. Gradually add the matzo meal. Stir until smooth. Let rest for 10-15 minutes. Wet hands with cold water. Form the mixture into small balls by rolling in the palms. Carefully drop the balls into boiling clear soup stock or salted water (1 tsp salt to 1 quart water). Cover and cook at a slow boil for 20 minutes.  Medium Firm: Mix the fat and the eggs. Add the matzo meal and the salt. When well blended add the soup stock or water. Mix well. Cover the bowl and  refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. Shape the mixture into small balls with wet hands. Bring the 2 quarts of water and the salt to a boil. Lower the heat and drop the matzo balls individually into the pot. Cover and cook for 30-40 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a pot of soup.  Very Firm: Blend the matzo meal with the salt and the fat. Add the well beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly and add cold water to make a dough firm enough to be shaped into balls. Form balls with wet hands and drop into the boiling 2 quarts water and salt. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, drain well and add to soup.
