Lemon Icebox Pie
Condensed Milk, juice of 2 lemons, Egg yolk, Graham Cracker Pie Crust, 
Add milk and egg yolks together, stir. Add lemon juice, blend well and pour  into pie crust.    Cover with merengue.    Bills notes:    Filling is kind of pale to my thinking. Add drop or 2 yellow color.    Pour filling into crust quickly--filling "sets up" fast.
