Place all dough ingredients except cooked onion in the machine, program for  knead and first rise. Press start. Strain onions and return liquid. At end  of final knead, add the onion (without liquid) to the machine. Restart and  knead only until the onion is roughly mixed in. The dough will be wet and  onion will remain in clumps, sticking out of the dough. Turn the dough out  on a well-floured board and knead briefly by hand to form a ball. Oil a  pizza pan or baking sheet. Place the dough on the prepared pan and pat into  a 12" disk. Coat the top of the dough with the onion juices. Cover with  plastic wrap and let it rise either at room temperature until doubled in  bulk, or in the refrigerator overnight.  A long cold rise in the  refrigerator will result in a more flavorful bread with a heartier  interior. Preheat the oven to 450 F. with the rack in the center position.    Just before baking the dough, use your fingertips to gently make  indentations in the surface. Drizzle on the oil and then sprinkle with salt  and pepper. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce to oven to 350 F. and bake for  another 12 to 15 minutes, or until the focaccia is golden brown. Serve hot  or at room temperature.    Source: Pizza Etc.
