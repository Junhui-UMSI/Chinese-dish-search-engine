Slice the tomatoes, onion and carrot. Put into a saucepan with the stock,  or water and stock cube, the fruit rinds, bay leaf and a little seasoning.  Cover the pan and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaf. Sieve  or liquidise the soup. Heat the margarine in the saucepan, stir in the  ilour, then gradually add the soup and the orange juice. Bring to the boil  and stir or whisk until the soup thickens slightly. Remove from the heat  and whisk in the cream then heat for 2 minutes, without boiling. While  cooking the soup put the narrow strips of orange rind into cold water,  bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes then strain. Top the soup with  the softened rind.    In a microwave: Simmer the tomatoes and other ingredients in the liquid for  about 20 minutes. Use DEFROST after the liquid comes to boiling point.    Variations: Serve as an unthickened soup, simply sieve or liquidise the  ingredients add the orange juice and heat or serve well chilled. Use 2 x 14  oz/400 g cans of chopped plum tomatoes instead of fresh.    Source: Marguerite Pattens Marvellous Meals, Yours Magazine, UK
