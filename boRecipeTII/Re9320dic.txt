Puff Pastry Purses with Zucchini, Brie and Prosciutto
Prosciutto, Red bell pepper, Zucchini, Brie, Butter, Garlic, Fresh parsley, Parmesan cheese, Frozen puff pastry, 
Preheat oven to 400F. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet over  medium- high heat. Add zucchini slices and garlic and saute until zucchini  is tender, about 7 minutes. Cool slightly. Mix in grated Parmesan cheese.    Roll out each pastry sheet to 16 x 11 inch rectangle. Cut five 5 x 5 inch  squares from each pastry sheet (reserve extra pastry for another use).  Press each pastry square into 1/3 cup muffin cup, leaving overhang.    Place 1/4 cup zucchini mixture in each pastry-lined muffin cup, dividing  equally. Place 1 Brie cube atop each. Place 1 prosciutto slice atop Brie.  Gather edges of puff pastry together and pinch firmly at top, forming  purses.    Bake purses in cups until golden, about 15 minutes. Place 1 purse on each  plate. Garnish each plate with chopped parsley and red bell pepper slices,  if desired, and serve.    *Aoelus is a chartered yacht in the British Virgin Islands    Printed in Bon Appetit April 1998    Typed and Busted by Carriej999@AOL.com 4/98    Recipe by: Michael and Dorothea Fisher, owners of Aeolus*    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Carriej999 <Carriej999@aol.com> on Apr 3,  1998
