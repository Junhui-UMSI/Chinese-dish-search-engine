Method: Heat oven to 375. Quickly combine first 6 ingredients to make  crust. Dont handle more than you have to; it gets tough if its overmixed.  Roll out and line a 9-inch tart pan with the dough. Arrange the pear halves  attractively cut side down in the shell so that the stem ends are all  facing into the center and bake for about 20 minutes. If the pears dont  all fit that way, chop some and mound them in the center. Combine the  remaining ingredients and pour into the pan and bake until firm, about 30  more minutes. Serve warm or cool. You can substitute pears in almost any  recipe you have that uses apples. Pear pie. Baked pears in pie crust. Fried  pears. Pork loin with sliced pears. Enjoy, very much.
