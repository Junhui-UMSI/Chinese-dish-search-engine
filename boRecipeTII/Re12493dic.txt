[Guide] Close-Up on Corn
INFO ON CORN, 
Classes of Corn: There are three different classes of sweet corn. Within  each group are yellow, white and bicolour types.    ~Normal sweet corn has the most tender kernels and a sugar content of 9-16  percent.    ~Sugar-enhanced corn has a sugar content of 35 percent    ~Supersweet corn has a sugar content of 45 percent; sugar converts slowly  to starch, keeping kernels tender longer.    Buying: ~ Choose corn cobs that have dark, stiff, moist silk and moist  bright green husks that completely cover the ear. ~ Individual corn kernels  should be mature enough to be felt through the husk. ~ Buy corn as fresh as  possible. Its best if eaten immediately, but you can keep unhusked cobs in  the refrigerator for up to three days.    Cooking: Stove-top: ~ Just before cooking, husk cobs and pick off any silk  that remains. ~ Place cobs in large pot of boiling water; return to boil  and boil for 7-10 minutes or until colour has deepened. ~ Do not add salt  to water ~ it will toughen the corn Microwave: ~ Just before cooking, husk  cobs and pick off any silk that remains. ~ Place on paper towels in  microwaveable dish. Cover and microwave at High until tender; 3-5 minutes  for one cob; 5-7 minutes for two cobs; 8-10 minutes for four cobs. Let  stand for 2 minutes before eating. ~ Alternative: Peel husks down to base  and remove silk. Sprinkle with desired spice/herbs. Close husks around ear  and microwave as above. Barbecue: ~ Peel back husks partway and remove  silk. Close husks, secure with string at top and soak in cold water for 20  minutes. ~ Place on grill over medium-high heat; close cover and cook,  turning frequently, for about 20 minutes or until husks are charred and  corn is deep yellow.    Freezing: ~ In large pot of boiling water, cook husked cobs for four  minutes or until colour has deepened. Drain and plunge into cold water;  drain well. Cut kernels from cob and pack in freezer bags; store in freezer  for up to one year. ~ To serve, cook kernels for about half of the usual  time or until heated through.
