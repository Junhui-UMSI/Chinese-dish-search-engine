Pear Salad W/raspberry Pecan Dressing
Canned pears in light syrup, Pears -or-, Head Boston lettuce, Roasted pecans, 
Wash and dry Boston lettuce. Arrange 2 or 3 leaves on a salad plate.    If you are lucky enough to have fresh, ripe pears peel them, cut in half  remove seeds and center. (If using canned pears, drain; then follow  remainder of directions.) Cut from bottom up in 1/2" slices - DO NOT SLICE  THROUGH. Place pear on top of lettuce and fan it out.    Drizzle Raspberry Pecan Dressing (I used Kens Fat Free) over pear. You  dont need much. Sprinkle toasted pecans on top.    You can prepare the lettuce and pears the morning of your dinner. Cover  with plastic wrap. Add dressing and pecans just before serving.
