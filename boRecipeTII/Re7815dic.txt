Portugese Sweet Bread (Santos)
Salt, Warm water, Beaten eggs, milk, Flour, Butter or margarine, Pkgs. yeast, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine yeast, water & 1 teas. sugar; let  stand 5 minutes.  Beat eggs in large bowl. In small pan, combine milk,  salt, butter and sugar; stir over low heat until milk is warm (butter may  not be melted).  Gradually stir in egg, then beat in 3 cups flour; add  yeast and heat until smooth. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make  dough; turn on  to lightly floured board and knead 8 to 10 minutes. Place  in greased bowl, cover, let rise until doubled in bulk (1-1/2 hours). Form  into 4 small loaves (I usually use cake pans for baking the bread.). Let  rise until doubled or at least an hour. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Cool on rack.
