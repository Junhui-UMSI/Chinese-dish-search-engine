In a large heavy flameproof casserole heat the oil over moderately high  heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it brown the brisket, patted dry  and seasoned with salt and pepper, and transfer it to a plate. Add the  onions to the casserole and cook them over moderate heat, stirring, until  they are golden. Add the broth, jam, brown sugar, lemon juice, brandy,  cinnamon, ginger, and salt and pepper to taste and bring the mixture to a  boil, stirring. Add the brisket with any juices that have accumulated on  the plate and simmer the mixture, covered, for 2 hours. Add the apricots,  prunes, and beer and simmer the mixture, covered, for 1 1/2 hours more, or  until the brisket is tender.
