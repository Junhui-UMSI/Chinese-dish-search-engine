Kentucky Bourbon Cake
Raisins, Bourbon, Butter, Sugar, Eggs, Flour, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Salt, Lemon zest, Lemon juice, Pecans, 
Marinate raisins in 1 cup of the bourbon for at least 1 hour, up to 12  hours; drain, reserving both raisins and bourbon. Preheat oven to 350  degrees. Butter and flour a 10-inch Bundt cake pan or other tube-cake pan.  Beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. (For best  results, use an electric mixer and start beating at a slow speed, gradually  increasing to moderate. If you allow this process to take about 15 minutes,  the butter will be very pale and look something like whipped cream. This  adds lightness to the cake.) Beat in the eggs 1 at a time, beating well  after each. In another bowl, sift together 3 3/4 cups of the flour, baking  powder, soda and salt. Combine reserved bourbon with the zest and lemon  juice. Add dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with the  bourbon mixture. Toss the remaining 1/4 cup of flour with the drained  raisins and the pecans. Fold into batter. Bake about 1-1/2 hours or until  the cake tests done. Cool about 10 minutes in the pan before turninout onto  a rack. Brush the remaining 1/2 cup of bourbon over the cake while it is  still somewhat warm. For long storage, wrap the cake in rinsed cheesecloth  that has been thoroughly moistened in bourbon. Then wrap in plastic or foil  so that it is airtight.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Chat Cat" <maintech@ne.infi.net> on Dec  10, 98
