Quick Greens, Brazilian Style
Cloves garlic, minced or to, Salt, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Warm water, Fresh collard greens, 
Wash the collard greens thoroughly to remove any dirt or grit. Drain well.  Pick over the greens, discarding any that are old and cutting out any  discolored spots and the fleshy ribs. Place leaves in a pile, roll them  into a thick cylinder and cut them into thin strips crosswise. Fluff the  cut greens into a bowl. Heat the olive oil in a heavy skillet, add the  garlic, and cook until it is slightly browned. Add the greens and cook,  tossing them frequently to make sure they are coated with the olive oil and  garlic. Add the water, season, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove and  serve warm.
