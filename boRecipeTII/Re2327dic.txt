Thanks also to all Recipe-a-Day members who took the time to send in a  recipe this month. Were just sorry we wont have an opportunity to publish  them all!    Simply prepare salad ingredients as directed, toss, and serve with a single  lemon wedge and cherry tomato for garnish.    Kitchen Staff Tip: To prepare your own Ginger Salad Dressing from scratch,  blend together 1 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped ginger root, 1/4 cup chopped  onion, 1/4 cup chopped carrot, and 2 tablespoons celery, chopped until very  fine. Add 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 cup peanut oil, and 1/2 cup mild vinegar.  Add freshly ground black pepper if desired. Shake to mix and well before  use. Best made a day ahead for flavors to meld.
