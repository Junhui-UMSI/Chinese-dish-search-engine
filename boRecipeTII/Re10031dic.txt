Quail with Rose Petal Sauce
Garlic, Cornstarch, Butter, Anise, Pitaya, Chestnuts, Honey, Quail, Roses, preferably red, Attar of roses, 
Remove the petals carefully from the roses. Dry pluck the quail,  remove the viscera, get them ready for frying.  After the quail are  plucked and dressed, their feet are pulled together and tied so that  the bird keeps a nice shape after being browned in butter and  sprinkled with salt and peper to taste.  The quail must be  dry-plucked because putting it in boiling water affects the flavor.    After the petals are removed from the roses, they are ground with  anise in a mortar. Separately, brown the chestnuts in a pan, remove  the peels, and cook them in water. Then, puree them. Mince the garlic  and brown slightly in butter; when it is transparent, add it to the  chestnut puree, along with the honey, the ground pitaya, and the rose  petals, add salt to taste. To thicken the sauce slightly, you may add  2 teaspoons of cornstarch. Last, strain through a fine sieve and add  no more than 2 drops of attar of roses, since otherwise it might have  too strong a flavor and smell. As soon as the seasoning has been  added, remove the sauce from heat. The quail should be immersed in  this sauce for ten minutes to infuse them with the flavor, and then  removed. The quail are placed on a platter, the sauce is poured over  them, and they are garnished with a single perfect rose in the center  and rose petals scattered around the outside; or the quail can be  served individually, on separate plates instead of a platter.
