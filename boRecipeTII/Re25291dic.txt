Topsy Turvey Apple Pie
Sugar, Butter, Crust for 2 crust pie, Nutmeg, Pecan or walnut halves, Filling for pie:, Sliced apples, Flour, Corn syrup, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, 
1.  In a 9" pie pan, combine brown sugar, corn syrup and melted butter      and spread evenly over the bottom of the pan. Arrange pecan or      walnut halves over the mixture. Set aside.    2.  Make your favorite pie crust. Take the bottom crust and put it      over the mixture in the pie pan. Heat oven to 425F.    3.  In a small bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, nutmeg, flour      and cinnamon; mix well. Arrange the apple/sugar mixture over the      bottom crust of the pie. Top with the top crust. Seal and flute.      Cut slits in several places.    4.  Bake at 425F for 8 minutes, and then reduce heat and continue to      bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes, or until golden brown. It would      be wise to place pie on cookie sheet covered with foil, as it      will run over.    5.  While pie is baking, prepare a glaze of 1/2 c confectioners sugar,      1 tsp vanilla, and enough milk to make into a glaze. This will be      used on the top of the pie when removed from the oven and still      hot.    6.  Remove pie from oven; loosen edge of pie. Cover top of pie with      glaze. While still hot, carefully invert pie onto large serving      plate. Serve warm or cold with whipped cream or ice cream.
