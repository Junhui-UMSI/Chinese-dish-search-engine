1. Preheat oven to 425^ degrees. 2. Cut ribs into 2-inch pieces and brush  them with a teaspoon or two of vegetable oil. Combine crumbs, flour, and  spices in a paper bag; add ribs and shake them in the seasonings. Spread  the seasoned ribs in a greased baking dish, and sprinkle the Tabasco sauce  on top. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes.    3. Baste the ribs once or twice during the cooking process and cover the  baking dish with aluminum foil if the ribs are browning too quickly. Make a  sauce from the cooking liquid by adding the tomato juice right after you  remove the ribs from the pan.
