Very Buttery Challah
Egg, Butter, Yeast, Salt, Sugar, Poppy Seeds, Sesame Seeds, Water, Flour, unbleached, Egg, 
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Beat 3 eggs in a large mixing bowl; add salt,  sugar, dissolved yeast, and butter. To this mixture, add 4 cups of the  flour (all at once). Stir in the flour and continue to add 3 more cups of  flour until the dough is of a soft consistency. Knead the dough on a  floured board until the dough is no longer sticky and is springy to the  touch. Place the dough in a greased mixing bowl and cover with a towel. Let  rise 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. Punch down the dough, knead it  a little, and divide it in 6 pieces. Roll each piece with your hands so  they become long, skinny ropes. Braid 3 ropes, pinching the ends together.  Repeat the process with the other 3 ropes. Place each braided loaf on it`s  own greased cookie sheet, cover with a towel, and let rise about an hour-  until doubled in bulk. Brush the loaves with the 2 beaten eggs, sprinkle  with poppy seeds or sesame seeds (optional). DO NOT PRE-HEAT OVEN- Bake in  a 350F degree oven about 45 minutes, until the bread is golden-brown.
