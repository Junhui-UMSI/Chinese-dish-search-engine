Date: Fri, 10 May 1996 11:24:17 -0500    From: "Goslowsky, George" <gjgoslow@ingr.com>  Got whacked in the head with this recipe that other night too.  Dont know  where it came from, probably left field.  Anyway, it sort of goes with the  chiles-for-desert thread.  I consider it to be a dinner desert salad.  The  original recipe goes like this, followed by what I consider to be necessary  modifications.    Mix thoroughly.  Serve chilled.  Makes about 4, 1 cup servings.    Now I dont know about you people, but only occasionally do I have a recipe  spring forth in all its winsome glory, needed no enhancement or further  refinement.  Usually I start with what I consider to be a good idea and  work from there. As is the case here. This is what I would do to improve  upon said salad. While it was good as it was, I think that it could be  better.   So here goes...    1.  Chill more thoroughly.  Didnt get it cold enough last night.    2.  Use super sharp cheddar.  Sharp didnt have enough tang to it.    3.  Use a higher quality cheese.  I think that I used Kraft, but it was  greasy tasting.    4.  Add the other ingredients.    5.  Ensure that the apples are very tart. Anyway. It definitely turned out  edible, but I think that I can improve on it.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #317    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
