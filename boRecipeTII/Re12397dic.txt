1. In a colander set over a large bowl, toss together zucchini and salt and  allow to drain for 10 minutes. Run water through colander to rinse salt  from zucchini, then squeeze to remove excess moisture. (Salt pulls water  from zucchini and keeps crust from being too wet.) Combine in a bowl with  eggs and mozzarella.    2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil a medium baking sheet. Press  zucchini mixture evenly onto sheet. Bake until lightly browned and crisp  (12 to 15 minutes).    3. Spread sauce over top of zucchini crust. Slice bell peppers into rings,  then lay on top of pizza along with tomatoes and chiles. Sprinkle with  Parmesan. Bake for 10 minutes and serve hot.
