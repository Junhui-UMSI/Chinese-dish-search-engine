NOTES : The tradition in most African-American families is to eat  slow-cooked leafy greens that are stewed down with a piece of smoked pork,  creating the proverbial "low gravy." Here the classic dish is updated with  less familiar Swiss chard, which is lightly steamed and served with a  homemade hot vinegar. You can store the leftover seasoned vinegar at room  temperature in a glass jar.
