Cup orange marmalade, Strawberries, large, Cream cheese, softened, 
Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Celebrations: Holiday Brunch: Celebrations is a class that shows you how to  have a dining event that not only tastes good and looks good but is  generally enjoyable. Fitting with the holiday season, we worked on a  holiday brunch. Aside from these recipes, we learned about table  presentation, planning and tricks to make the event memorable. We also  created several types of food related decorations.    Whip together cream cheese and orange marmalade. Place a star tip into a  pastry bag or zip lock baggie and fill with mixture.    To prepare strawberries, rinse and dry completely. Cut a small base so  strawberries dont roll and then cut a V slice into front of strawberry so  it looks like a mouth. Fill strawberry with cream mixture. Refrigerate  until ready to serve.    This can be made 3 hours in advance.
