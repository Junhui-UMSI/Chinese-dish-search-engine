Tangy Citrus Salad
Salt, or to taste, Orange juice, Romaine lettuce, Vegetable oil, Sugar, Red onions, sliced, Cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, Red grapefruit, Jicama sticks, Red-leaf lettuce, VINAIGRETTE DRESSING, Oranges, SALAD, 
Combine the ingredients for the dressing. Refrigerate until ready to add to  the salad.    Wash the lettuce, drain and dry by patting with paper towels. Refrigerate  several hours before serving. Peel the grapefruit and oranges with a sharp  knife to remove both the outer skin and the inner white pith. Cut out each  section so it is free of any membrane. When ready to assemble the salad,  tear the lettuce into bite-sized pieces. Bombine with the fruit, onion, and  jicama in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over the greens; toss lightly to  coat the lettuce mixture.
