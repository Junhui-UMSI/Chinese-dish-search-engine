Artichokes Stuffed with Herbed Goat Cheese
Fresh Chives, Garlic, Chevre, Artichokes, Baguette, Fresh Herbs, Black Pepper, 
Prepare and cook medium artichokes as directed - remove any stem to form a  flat base. (Scrape off stems fibrous skin with a vegetable peeler and cook  along with the globe, or use it as an ingredient in a stuffing or saute.)  Cut straight across the artichoke, removing about the top third of the  leaves. Using kitchen shears, trim off the torny tips of the other leaves.  Turn the artichokes upside down in water, and shake well to wash off any  pesticides, dirt, and insects. Cut artichokes tend to darken quickly, so as  soon as they are trimmed and washed, place them in a mixture of 2 T of  lemon juice or vinegar per quart of water while you finish your recipe  preparation. Usually place trimmed artichokes leaf side down in poaching  liquid. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat from about 30-40 minutes.    Cool, then remove choke and scrape out thistle. Set aside. Preheat oven to  375. In a small bowl, combine chevre with herbs, chives, garlic and black  pepper.    Fill cavity of artichoke with cheese mixture, and spoon some in between  leaves. Place artichokes in a shallow pan and bake in oven for about 15  minutes, or until goat cheese is thoroughly warm. Serve with hand-torn  pieces of bread.    Shared by Jill Proehl, REG 2 - St. Louis, MO    NOTES : For Herb Mix, it is recommended you use a combination of oregano,  basil, marjoram, and parsley. To stuff - grab hold of the choke, willfully  pulling it out.  Dig down with a small knife or serrated grapefruit spoon  and remove the thistle.  To make it easier, parboil the artichoke for about  10 minutes, turn leaf side down and press firmly on the base of the heart,  spreading leaves and opening choke area for removal and stuffing.
