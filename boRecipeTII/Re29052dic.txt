Baked Potato Bread
Water, Sour cream, Salt, Bacon bits, Dry Milk, Sugar, Chives, White Bread Flour, Potato Flakes; instant, Yeast, 
Add ingredients according to Automatic Bread machines instructions.    This dough will be very dry.  Resist the urge to add water.    For best flavor, use real bacon bits.  (I use the bacon bits in the bottle,  but they are labeled real bacon bits.)    This recipe can be baked witht he regular or rapid bake cycles.
