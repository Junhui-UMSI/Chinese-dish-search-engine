Fill  a cake decorator tube with mixture.  From the point, slit each berry into  quarters (do not cut through the bottom of the berry).  Pipe cream cheese  mixture into each berry.  Arrange on a serving tray and garnish with  strawberry or mint leaves.    The picture looks yummy, I cant wait to try these myself!  The book is  called "A Pinch of Salt Lake" and put out by the junior league.    EAT-L DIGEST 15 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
