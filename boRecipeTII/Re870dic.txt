Place the heads of  garlic in a small, unoiled baking dish or on a sheet of aluminum foil. Add  a tablespoon of water and either cover the dish tightly with foil or fold  the sheet of aluminum foil to form a sealed package. Bake for 45 to 60  miniutes, until the cloves are very soft to the touch. Baking time will  vary depending upon the size of the heads of garlic. Let cool. Squeeze the  garlic paste from the heads as needed. Sealed and refrigerated, roasted  garlic will keep for at least a week.
