This recipe contains no carbonation and no ice cream.  I have not tried it  spiked, but you could probably add rum to it (Im not up on alcohol, but I  believe thats supposed to be good in punch). This is our familys punch  recipe--we serve it for all special occasions.     I will give what I think are the proportions first, then Ill give the  exact amounts my mother-in-law uses for the 11 people in our extended  family.     *Sorry, I dont know the size of the "tall can", but its the standard  U.S. size that is larger than the 12-oz.-can size.     Prepare lemonade.  Reconstitute orange juice, pineapple juice,and  grapefruit juice, according to package directions, and in separate  containers. Add lemonade to punch bowl. Add all of the orange juice, 1/2  (up to 3/4) of the pineapple juice, and 1/2 of the grapefruit juice.     Slice thin orange wheels and float on top for a festive look.  Cherries  would also look nice.    JILLS@VNET.IBM.COM    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
