Apple Foldovers
Recipe basic puff pastry, Egg yolk, Pecans, Cornstarch, Brown Sugar, Butter or Margarine, Lemon juice, Water, Peeled sliced apples, Powdered sugar, 
Roll pastry into a 17- x 13-inch rectangle. Cut pastry into 4-inch squares;  place squares on ungreased baking sheets.    Combine egg yolk and water; brush edges of pastry with yolk mixture.    Fold each square of pastry into a triangle; press edges of foldovers  together with a fork. Bake at 425F for 13 to 15 minutes or until foldovers  are puffed and golden brown. Let foldovers cool on a wire rack.    Combine apples, brown sugar, pecans, butter, lemon juice, and cornstarch in  a medium saucepan, stirring until cornstarch dissolves; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cook, uncovered, about 10 minutes or until apples are  tender.    Slice foldovers in half horizontally, not cutting completely through long  side of pastry.    Spoon hot filling into foldovers; sprinkle tops with powdered sugar.    Yield: 1 dozen.    Note: One (17 1/4-ounce) package frozen puff pastry may be substituted for  Basic Puff Pastry.
