Tofu Burgers #1
Square firm tofu (1/2lb), Tamari or soy sauce, Tahini, Dill weed, Ground walnuts, Bread crumbs, 
Sorry that I didnt post this in time for Memorial Day, but I wanted to put  this recipe through the field test first.  It held up very well on the  grill, and tasted great topped with cheese, tomatoes and lettuce. This  recipe is an adaptation of a recipe published in The Horn of the Moon Cafe  Cookbook from Montpelier Vt. Enjoy.    Mash the Tofu with the Tahini.  Add dill weed and tamari.  Mix until well  blended.  Add bread crubs slowly until desired texture is achieved.  The  texture should be just stiff enough to form patties without being too  moist. Form into patties and grill until brown on both sides.    PS - I havent tried it, but I suspect that this mix would also make really  good meatballs to go with spaghetti.
