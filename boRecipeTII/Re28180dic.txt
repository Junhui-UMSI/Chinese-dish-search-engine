Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender.  While the eggplant is baking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in  a medium saute pan until very hot. Add onion and garlic and saute until you  can smell the aroma, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, toss with onion, and  saute lightly. Add marjoram and saute for about 2 minutes. Remove from heat  and let cool. Place cooled tomato mixture in a bowl and add olives, bread  crumbs, and Parmesan cheese; mix well. When eggplant is tender, remove from  oven and let cool slightly. (Leave oven at 350 F for baking the stuffed  eggplant.) Scoop the middle of the eggplant out, leaving 1 inch of flesh  all the way around. Do not break the skin. Let the eggplant flesh cool,  then chop roughly and add to the stuffing. Season with salt and pepper.  Place the stuffing back into the 4 eggplant halves. Bake for 15 to 20  minutes, or until stuffing is golden brown. Serve hot.    Recipe is from _Cooking with Caprial American Bistro Fare_ by Caprial  Pence.
