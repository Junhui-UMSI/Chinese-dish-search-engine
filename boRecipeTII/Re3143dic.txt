Discard outer leaves of the lemongrass. Slice thin the bottom 4" and mash  to a paste in a mortar with pestle. In a shallow bowl, stir together the  peanuts, cornmeal, 2 Tbsp. of the garlic, gingerroot, lemongrass, black  pepper, salt and 1/3 cup of the flour. Have ready, in 2 separate shallow  bowls, the remaining 1 cup of flour and the buttermilk. Dredge the chicken  pieces well in the flour, shaking off the excess, dip them in the  buttermilk, letting the excess drip off, and roll them in the peanut  mixture, transferring them as they are coated to an oiled shallow baking  dish.   Bake the chicken, covered tightly with foil, in the middle of a preheated  350F oven for 45 minutes, remove the foil carefully and bake the chicken  for 20 - 25 minutes more, or until golden (the chicken will crisp as it  cools). In a small saucpan combine the vinegar, sugar, remaining 2 1/2  Tbsp. garlic, crushed red chilies, nam pla and the water, bring the mixture  to a boil, and simmer it until it is reduced by half. Serve the chicken  with the sauce.  (Gourmet 12/91)
