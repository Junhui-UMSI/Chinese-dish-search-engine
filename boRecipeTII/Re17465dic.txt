Walnut-Cilantro Sauce

(from Paula Wolferts Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean)    In a food processor, grind walnuts with salt and paprika. After walnuts  exude their oil and the mixture is pasty, blend in just enough warm water  to make walnuts turn creamy and light-colored. Scrape into small bowl.  Crush garlic with a pinch of salt. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-low  heat. Add garlic and cilantro and cook, stirring, until oil just begins to  sizzle (maybe 2 - 3 minutes). Add to the walnuts along with the lemon juice  and enough of the water to give the sauce an even consistency. Correct the  seasoning. Makes one cup.    If you use this for fish, brush fillets with olive oil and bake on an oiled  baking sheet until just cooked, about 5 minutes. Transfer fish to a shallow  serving dish. Spread an even layer of sauce over each fillet and garnish  with lemon. Serve at room temperature.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by pamra@rockland.net (Alexandra Soltow) on  May 11, 1998
