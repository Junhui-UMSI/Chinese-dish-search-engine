Adjust the water to compensate for different sizes of egg and banana.    Measure the dry group into mixing bowl, stir until well blended to evenly  distribute the gluten, either let come to room temperature or warm in  microwave until slightly warm.    Toast the walnuts7 minutes at 275 degrees and cooled a bit.    Add  the walnuts 8 minutes before end of knead cycle    Be sure to mix in the gluten until very well distributed, as described. I  keep all my flours in the refrigerator, and warm the mixed flours in the  microwave just before starting the bread.
