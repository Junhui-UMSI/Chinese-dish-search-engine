1. Slice chicken into 1x2x1/4" pieces, dredge in corn starch and lay  aside to dry slightly on wax paper. Prepare a batter in a small bowl  of 1 egg, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup flour, and salt. Mix batter very  thoroughly until smooth. Assemble rest of ingredients.    2. Pour oil halfway up in your wok. Turn on burner to high and allow  oil to heat up. PLace a piece of bread crust to test readiness of  oil. If bread crust is medium browned, then oil is ready. If bread  crust is dark brown or black, shut heat off of oil and allow to cool  5 minutes or more before turning heat back on. Retest oil before  cooking anything in it. If bread crust is a very light brown, then  oil is not quite ready yet.    3. When oil is ready, place about 8-10 pieces of chicken into batter,  take a pair of chop sticks or fork and lift pieces out of batter and  slice into oil in wok. Chicken pieces will slide to bottom of oil at  first and will then rise. After chicken is risen, deep fry 2 1/2  minutes on each side. Drain chicken on paper toweling to remove  excess oil. Place chicken in serving plate. Repeat procedure until  all chicken is cooked.    4. In a separate small pot, place 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup cider  vinegar, cook until dissolved. Add pineapple chunks and juice. Stir up  corn starch thoroughly in 1/2 cup water, add to pot and stir  thoroughly. Cook under medium heat 3-5 minutes until gravy is clear.  Add maraschino cherries. Pour over chicken.    NOTE: Breaded, deep fried shrimps lend well to this recipe.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cc-wok.zip
