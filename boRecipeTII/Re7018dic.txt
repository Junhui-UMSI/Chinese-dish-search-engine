1. Stem, seed, and remove ribs from peppers. Cut lengthwise into  1-inch-wide strips; leave curved ends intact. Cut onion in half length-  wise and slice into 1/4-inch-thick semicircles.    2. Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and  onions and cook for about 2 minutes. Add pepper strips and sugar and toss  for 2 to 3 minutes. Cover pan and turn heat to low. Cook, stirring  occasionally until peppers are very soft, 30 to 35 minutes.    3. Remove cover and raise heat to medium. Cook, stirring often, until most  of the liquid evaporates and peppers are nicely glazed, about 3 minutes.  Add a little water, if necessary, to avoid scorching. Season with salt and  pepper. Serve peperonata warm or at room temperature.    Martha Stewart Living/August/94  Scanned & fixed by Di Pahl  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #036 by John Merkel <jmerk@doitnow.com> on  Feb 3, 1997.
