Called my father-in-law (in Sydney) on Christmas Day and told him what we  had had for dinner. "Thats very Australian!" he exclaimed.  "That was the  whole point," I replied. :-) Anyhow, heres the menu with recipes and  comments (all recipes were taken from the Australian cookbook Manda gave  me): Prawn salad(*), Standing rib roast, Yorkshire pudding(*), Roast  potatoes and butternut squash, Stir fried broccoli and snow peas,  Pavlova(*). (ones marked * are in this cookbook).    Place the peeled prawns in a powl and pour over the lemon dressing. Cover  and refrigerate for 1 hour.    Cut the capsicum, carot and celery into fine shreds, then place into a bowl  of iced water. Before serving, drain the vegetables and the prawns (but  reserve dressing). Peel and slice the avocado and arrange with the fruit,  crispy vegetables and lettuce on a large platter or individual plates.  Drizzle over the lemon dressing and sprinkle with parsley. Accompany with  wholegrain bread.    Lemon Dressing: Remove a couple of paper then strips of lemon peel with a  potato peeler or sharp knife. Cut into fine strips. Crush the garlic and  put into a bowl, stir in the mustar, then add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and  the oil. Add a pinch of salt and pepper, mix well, and add the lemon peel.    This salad was a lot of work and I was the only one who seemed to  appreciate it. Kids didnt like the lemon dressing so I had to pull out the  bottled dressing from the fridge (sigh).
