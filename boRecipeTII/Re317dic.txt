Lefse
Sour milk; or buttermilk, Sugar, Corn syrup, Baking soda, Cardamom, All-purpose flour, 
Combine the ingredients and work the mixture with the hands, or in an  electric mixer with a dough hook, to make a soft, pliable dough.  Divide  the dough into two pieces and roll each piece about 1/8 inch thick into a  square, oblong, or circle.  Cut into squares or circles with a 4-6 inch  cutter.  Bake on a lightly floured griddle, over quite low heat, 12-15  minutes one each side.  The lefse should color very slightly.

Rakes)  NOTES : "Lefse is a rather unusual flatbread of Scandinavian origin, and     there are many different recipes for it. It can be eaten warm or     cold.  When cold, it grows quite firm and crisp, but it is     traditionally dipped lightly into water and softened before being     rolled with a filling or simply spread with butter. When it is     eaten warm, it should be taken from the griddle, folded into a     napkin, and served with butter, cheeses, preserves, or other     fillings.  In either case, it is easy to prepare and delightful to     eat."
