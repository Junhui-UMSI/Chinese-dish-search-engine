Apple Cake
POUR INTO A CASSEROLE DISH, Hot fruit (apples, cherries), Flour, Sugar, Boiling water, Salt, Baking Powder, Egg whites, 
Add ingredients in order, mixing as you go. Pour over fruit and bake at 350  for about 30 minutes.    This is surprisingly good. Ginger is an unusual spice in apple things, but  it works nicely.
