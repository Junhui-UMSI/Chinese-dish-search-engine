Tapenade Noire
Pitted Nicoise olives, Cloves of garlic, peeled, Anchovy fillets, Virgin olive oil, Capers, Herbes de Provence (this is, Cognac (optional), 
Place the pitted olives, anchovies, capers, garlic and herbs into a blender  and begin to puree the contents. Slowly add the olive oil, stopping  occasionally to scrape down the sides and stir the mixture with a rubber  spatula. Add enough oil to make a slightly runny mixture. Turn out of the  blender and into a small dish. You may add cognac for a smoother, more  elegant flavor, but for a lusty flavor, it may be omitted. Spread the  tapenade, after letting it sit for about an hour, into small slices of  baguette loaves. You may lightly toast the slices if you want. Note:  "Herbes de Provence" can include many different combinations of  ingredients. The idea is to add regional flare, not a specific taste.  Finally, this spread contrasts pleasantly with Tapenade Blanche.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 12 Sep 96    From:    Joe Ames <ames@PROLOG.NET>    Date:    Thu, 12 Sep 1996 18:12:33 -0400
