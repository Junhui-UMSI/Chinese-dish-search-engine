Basic Pancakes
Flour, Sugar, Baking soda, Salt, Milk, Egg equivalent, 
The recipe calls for 1 T. oil, but you can substitute mashed banana, prune  puree, applesauce, whatever. I cook these on a non-stick griddle sprayed  lightly with Pam    Zoe asked for pancake recipes. This is the basic one Ive used for many  years, from the old New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook (which  unfortunately I no longer have).    Recently Ive begun mixing up the dry ingredients in large quantities,  using a mixture of flours. Last time it was something like 3 c. whole wheat  flour, 2 c. cornmeal, 1 c. rye flour. Think Ill put in some oatmeal next  time. Whatever your mixture, for every cup of flour add 1 tsp. soda, 1/2  tsp. salt, and 1 T. sugar. Then when you get ready to make pancakes, for  every 1 1/4 c. pancake mix, just add 1 c. buttermilk, 1 egg equivalent, and  1 T. of your fat substitute. Its nice to have on hand. I store mine in big  coffee cans, with a bay leaf added to discourage the creepy-crawlies (the  bay leaf has always worked for me--knock on wood).
