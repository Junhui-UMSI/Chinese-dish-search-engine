Quick Jerky
RECIPE BELOW, 
I make Jerky by buying about 5+ lbs of beef. Usually a roast. (sirloin is  yummy and you can find a whole sirloin on sale alot.)I then remove all of  the fat (all of the fat!!!) if you leave fat then it will become rancid if  kept very long. Cut the beef into strips. If you cut with the grain then  the jerky will be chewier (the way I like It) Mix in a bowl      1/4    cup soy sauce 1 tblspn worstershire sauce 1 tsp garlic powder 1  tsp onion powder 1 tsp black pepper (cracked if possible) (optional red  pepper flakes will give it more zing) 1 tblspn liquid smoke place the  strips of meat into marinade and let soak for about 24 hours. place strips  on food dryer racks and dry for about 8 to 10 hours or until dry to your  personal preference. I will rotate the racks every couple of hours or so.    If you have a meat smoker then omit the liquid smoke and smoke meat at a  low temp until dry.
