Tomato Sauce with Orange and Basil
Carrot; shredded, Italian plum tomatoes, minced or pressed, Onion, salt and pepper, Fresh basil; chopped, Garlic, Fruity olive oil, + 2 tsp. grated orange peel, (colored part only), cored & coarsely chopped, 
Saute garlic in olive oil for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add carrots and onion and  saute until soft and tender. Add tomatoes, cover, and simmer (do not boil)  for 20 minutes. Uncover, add orange peel and basil, and simmer another 20  minutes.    At this point, sauce can be processed through a food mill for a smooth,  creamy texture or left as is for a more robust sauce. In either case, cook  another 10 to 15 minutes until sauce is thickened, adding salt and pepper.    The editors wrote: "The appeal of this sauce lay in its freshness,  simplicity and secret ingredient - orange peel. Michael serves it over  fish, meat or vegetables, as well as angel-hair pasta."
