Had an outstanding weekend at sales this time, including some neat  cookbooks++a Danish one, a Mexican one, an Appalachian one, along  with a small Mongolian Firepot and about two grand worth of software  that I got for thirty bucks.  Things like Ventura publisher and a  complete LAN setup including the hardware.  The guy having the sale  said "Thank God someone came along who knows what this stuff is!" I  was just thankful I got there first!.  No ridged skillet yet and I  still havent found a good wok for Alison, but the sales are really  picking up again now that spring is here.    Stumbled across this recipe in one of the books and thought it might  be of at least passing to ya...  ;-} Maybe make it with some nice  fresh salmon?    Season fish with salt, pepper, and tarragon leaves and soak in lime  juice for a few minutes.  Set the oven at 375F and bake fish in  buttered baking dish until it flakes easily when pierced with a fork,  about 25 minutes.    While fish is baking, combine tomatoes, parsley, avocado, garlic,  minced onion, oil chili powder, salt and pepper to taste.  (We  suggest tasting the guacamole as the chili powder is added, so that  you can get just the degree of heat you desire.)    Spread the above mixture over the cool fish.  Garnish with black olive  rings and strips of sweet red pepper.    Makes 6 to 8 servings.    From "The Art of Mexican Cooking" by Jan Aaron and Sachs Salom.  Doubleday and Company, N.Y., 1965.
