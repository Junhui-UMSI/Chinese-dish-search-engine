Cut the apples in quarters  and remove the cores and skin, then cut into thin slices. Place the apple  slices in a bowl and sprinkle the lemon juice over them. Place 1 cup of the  flour in a second bowl and make a well in it. Dissolve the yeast in the  water and pour it into the well; stir with a wooden spoon. Add the sugar,  melted lard, grated lemon peel and eggs, and when these ingredients are all  well incorporated, sprinkle in the remaining flour. Stir very well, until  the dough is smooth and very soft, then add the soaked raisins (I left them  out cause I didnt have any) and half the apple slices, mixing them in  well.    Place the dough in an oiled cake mold or springform pan and arrange the  remaining apple slices on top.  Cover with a dish towel and let the dough  rise until it is almost doubled in bulk.    When the dough has risen, remove the towel and bake in a preheated 400F  oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the cake is golden brown.  Let the cake cool for 30 minutes before turning out.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
