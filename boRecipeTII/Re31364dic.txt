Pronounced "Barra Clathee".    Preheat the oven to 160 Centigrade (moderate oven). Mix all the dry  ingredients and then add the beaten egg. Add a little milk and mix well to  get the consistency right (damp but not wet, similar to a cake mix). Put  the mix into a greased loaf tin and bake for about an hour. The result is  like any good fruit cake - moist inside, but not wet.  Cool and slice to serve, well buttered.    http://www.grossi.co.uk/wales/recipe.htm  Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 17, 1998
