Add lemon juice, honey, curry  powder, chili pepper and salt. Mix and simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Cover; let  stand in refrigerator 2 to 3 hours to let flavors blend. Arrange rabbit  pieces in a shallow dish; spoon sauce over pieces. Cover and marinate 3 to  6 hours, or over night, in refrigerator.    Drain pieces and save sauce. Place pieces on a rack in broiling pan.  Place  in broiler so top of meat is about 4" from source of heat. Broil 12 to 15  minutes on first side, turn, broil 10 to 12 minutes on second side. Brush  frequently with marinade while broiling.  This may be grilled on charcoal  grille using same procedures.
