Vegetarian Shmalts
Onions, Carrots, Bottle Corn oil, Stick Plain; no salt, no, 
This recipe I received from my in laws mother which we call Granny, They  came to Israel from S.Africa.    Source: From my mother with love & more by Granny Alice ( Flaks)  Zygielbaum.    yield: A lot.    In a heavy saucepan melt margarine in oil and bring to a warm temperature.  Mean while. Peel onions and carrots, In the food processor, grate carrots,  and slice onions thin . When oil / margarine are warm ,add carrots ,  onions, and stir, when it started to boil like stir more often, The minute  it starting to get gold light brown color it is the time to take the onions  / carrots out with a slotted spoon into a sieve that sit upon a bowl. Cool  . Transfer to very clean glass container. ( I use 2 cups container) Cover  with nylon seal, and a lid on top. Keep in refrigerator. It keeps up to  year. Whenever you want to use it , first shake it and then use as much as  you need. With the Carrots / onions which I call them now Grivelach I put  in an air tight plastic container, and keep in my freezer. You can add this  to any recipe that ask for fried onions, like Mashed Potato ect....    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #304 by ZVI&RINA PERRY  <pzvi@netvision.net.il> on
