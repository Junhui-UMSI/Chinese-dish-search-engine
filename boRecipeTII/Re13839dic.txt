Willies Crisp
Flour, Butter, To 3/4 cup sugar, Baking Powder, Flour, Egg, Sugar, Salt, To 6 cups peeled, seeded,, 
I love cobblers, crisps, etc., but never make them.  This one may  change my mind.  What can you say about a recipe that starts like  this?    "...When I called her, she read me the recipe from a small black cook  that contains, she says, the recipes that have no peer, the benchmark  recipes. Willies Crisp is part of this collection, and although I  have no idea who Willie is, I do know that his is the only crisp Ive  ever had that was crisp. It is perfect on top of fruit or berries."    Preheat the oven to 375F. Have ready an 8 x 8-inch baking dish (no  need to butter it). Put 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder  and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir to mix well.  Make a well in  the center of the dry ingredients and add the beaten egg. (Dont add  the egg now unless you are going to bake this right away. The sugar  will begin to melt, and the mixture wont crumble and spread  properly.) Stir mixture with a fork.  It should be crumbly; if it  seems too dry, add a little more egg. Put the fruit or berries into  another mixing bowl.  Stir together the 2 tablespoons flour and sugar  to taste. Add to the fruit and toss lightly to coat. Spoon fruit into  the baking dish and spread evenly.  Sprinkle the crisp mixture evenly  over the top. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the crisp  mixture. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden.  Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.    Serves 9.
