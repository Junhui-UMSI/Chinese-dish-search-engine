The Washington Post on Wednesday published this recipe from Joyce  Goldsteins new cookbook, "Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish  Kitchen" (Chronicle Books), which it describes as "a distinctive cuisine  that mixes Sephardic, Middle Eastern and Spanish cooking traditions with  Italian ingredients and methods."    Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Warm the olive oil in a large  saute pan over high heat. Add the chicken pieces and saute until golden on  all sides. Add the olives, garlic, tomatoes and sage, rosemary and basil  (if using). Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until the chicken is tender,  about 25 minutes.    Uncover the pan and add the red wine. Raise the heat to high and cook  rapidly to reduce the pan juices. Adjust the seasonings. Transfer to a  large warmed platter and sprinkle with more fresh herbs, if desired. Serve  at once.    Per serving (without herbs): 505 calories, 44 gm protein, 6 gm  carbohydrates, 31 gm fat, 127 mg cholesterol, 7 gm saturated fat, 229 mg  sodium, trace dietary fiber
