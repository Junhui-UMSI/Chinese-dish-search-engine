Cinnamon, White chocolate, Butter, Heavy cream, Sugar, Eggs, Vanilla, Snickers, Sugar, Graham cracker crumbs, Cream cheese, 
In a mixer, fitted with a paddle, beat cream cheese for 5 minutes. Scrape  down the sides of the bowl and add sugar and continue to mix. Add eggs one  at a time and the vanilla. Scrape down the sides again. Meanwhile, in the  top of a double boiler, melt white chocolate and add cream. Add the melted  chocolate mixture to the cream cheese mixture slowly and continue to mix.  Line the bottom of a 10" springform pan with graham cracker crumbs, sugar,  cinnamon and softened butter mixed together well. Add 1/2 of the crushed  Snickers in a deep mound in the center of the pan. Pour in the chocolate-  cream cheese mixture. Place in a water bath of 1/2" of water. Bake at 350  degrees for 1 1/2 hours. Make sure that there always is water in the water  bath. Remove from the oven and let cool for 2 hours before cutting. Top  with Hersheys Hot Fudge and the remaining crushed Snickers.    We enjoyed this at the GAR WOODS Grill and Pier in Carnelian Bay, CA. on  beautiful Lake Tahoe.
