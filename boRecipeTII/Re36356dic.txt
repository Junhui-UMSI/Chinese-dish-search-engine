In large skillet, over medium-high heat, cook beef, onion, pepper and  garlic until beef is no longer pink, stirring to break up meat; drain. Keep  warm.    In small skillet, over medium heat, heat tomato sauce, steak sauce and  Italian seasoning to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer 5 minutes or until  slightly thickened. Stir 1 cup tomato sauce mixture into beef mixture; set  aside. Keep remaining tomato sauce mixture warm.    Unroll pizza dough from 1 package; divide into 4 equal pieces. Roll each  piece into a 6 inch square; spoon 1/3 cup reserved beef mixture onto center  of each square. Top with 1/4 cup cheese. Fold dough over to form triangle.  Press edges together, sealing well with tines of fork. Place on lightly  greased baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough, filling and cheese to  make a total of 8 calzones. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes or until golden  brown. Serve with warm sauce. Garnish as desired. Makes 8 servings.
