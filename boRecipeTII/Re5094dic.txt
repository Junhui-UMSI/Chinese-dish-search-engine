Pico De Gallo Salsa - Topping for Fajitas
Jalapeno chillies, Ice, Onion, Garlic, Salt to taste, cilantro, Juice of 1 lime, Tomatoes, 
Saving cilantro until the last minute, adding just to the portion of salsa  you are serving so the leaves will not turn brownish. Mix all ingredients  together.    All the elements of a good Pico De Gallo should remain distinct, so it is  NEVER run through a blender--when it is done correctly. Due to the hearty  amount of fresh lime juice acting as a preservative, this salsa will keep  in the refrigerator for 3 days. Viva Texas! This recipe is taken from the  "The Salsa Book" by Jaqueline Higuera McMahan.    *My Notes: I think most of the Picos Ive tasted here in Texas use the  serrano green chiles instead of jalapenos-a little hotter, a little more  distinct. Although McMahan states that the cilantro is optional, I believe  that it not only is essential, but its the crowning taste of a good  fajita. A must! Fajitas (in addition to the Pico) are also good when topped  with marinated grilled onions, avacado or guacamole (guac. is better), sour  cream (in limited amounts), taco sauce and/or other salsas. Mandy Rose, if  you take my advise and use the Pico De Gallo on your fajitas, your guests  will be mightily impressed that you KNOW what youre doing when it comes to  this wonderful food. Its quite "toothsome". Posted to EAT-L Digest by  MiKicks@AOL.COM on Sep 2, 1997
