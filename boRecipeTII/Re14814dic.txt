1234 Rice Pilaf
Pats coil fideo ( about 1, Butter, (14.5 oz. each) chicken, 
Melt butter in a 3-4 qt. sauce pan on medium heat. Break the fideo into 1-2  inch pieces and brown carefully in the butter until golden brown. Add the  rice and continue browning until the rice starts to lose its translucent  quality. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat  to low. Cook about 40 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed. This is  one of my most requested family favorites, it freezes well, and holds well  for buffets and pot lucks. If you cut the recipe in half, reduce the  cooking time to 25-30 minutes.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by GAdams1350@aol.com on Sep 5, 1997
