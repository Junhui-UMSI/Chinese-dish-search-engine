Drain the beans & slip them outr of their skins.  If the skins cling too  tightly, boil them for 5 to 10 minutes & then skin. Put peeled beans in a  pot with celery & onion. Add just enough water to cover & bring to a  simmer.  Add the 2 ts salt, cover & cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the  beans are very soft. Add more water if necessary. Drain & place in a  processor with the 2 tb olive oil. Clean the broccoli rabe by peeling off  any thick skin covering the larger stems & cut into 2" pieces. Rinse the  greens well. Bring the water to a boil, add the greens & 1 tb salt, cover &  cook until the greens are soft but not mushy, 5 minutes. Drain. Warm the 3  tb olive oil in a skillet & slowly saute the garlic just enough until it is  golden brown & soft.  Do not let it brown.  Add the greens & swilr them  around in well flavoured oil. Serve on a platter, spooning the garlic  infused greens over the favas.
