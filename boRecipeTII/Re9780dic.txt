Pumpkin Soup Served in the Pumpkin
Cheddar Cheese, Whipping cream, Chicken Stock, Salt and pepper, Pumpkin, croutons, Nutmeg, gruy√®re cheese, 
Were going to serve it in the shell it comes in. Its one of the  presentations I saw at home and in the countryside in Europe and requires a  pumpkin about the size of a basketball for this recipe. You can use a  smaller or larger one as seems to suit your group. The fillings can be  increased, decreased or changed a great deal, up to about 4 cups croutons,  for example. One addition that adds a rich flavor is chopped chestnuts.  Crumbled bacon works well and so does a little chopped and sauteed onion  and together, theyre heavenly. This is most assuredly not a low fat dish  but if the rest of the meal is OK, this will make a most memorable  addition. And if the rest of the meal is high in fats, well, sometimes we  have to feed the soul, too. Tomorrow...    Method: Preheat oven to 425. Cut the top of the pumpkin as though for a  Jack OLantern. Remove strings and seeds and put croutons and cheeses in  layers. Pour in cream and stock, add spices. Replace top and bake about 2  hours. Bring to the table and use a large spoon to scoop out pumpkin and  fillings. Top with liquid, garnish with more croutons or a sprinkling of  cinnamon.    If the soup is just one part of a holiday dinner, this recipe could serve  14 or 16 people as a very flavorful opening to the meal.
