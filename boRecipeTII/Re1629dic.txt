Capers for Salad
Capers, Vinegar, 
Capers are a flower bud and are usually packed in brine (salt and water +)  but not oil. They cant be high in fat, as buds dont have to feed the  embyro of the plant as seeds do. They preceed seeds in the develpoopment  sage, and even preseed the flowers. I use them instead of salad dressing in  the following manner.    Drain the jar of capers and rinse the capers (I do this repeatedly right in  the jar, dumping the water out carefully.) Soak for a half hour or so in  the last water rinse and drain. Put a tasty vinagar,like balsamic or wine  or tarragon in the jar with the capers and refrigerate for several days (1  or 2). Put a spoon of capers and viagar on you salad and enjoy. This makes  a fat free dressing    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "W. Baker" <wbaker@panix.com> on Aug 11,  1998,
