Aji Sauce #1
Aji chiles -or-, Queso blanco (white cheese), olive oil, Jalapeno chiles, Heavy cream, 
Well, Im just taking a wild stab here, but _The_Whole_Chile _Pepper_Book_  has a recipe for Papas a la Huancaina that is a dish of boiled potatoes  topped with cheese and a sauce that is probably light green and creamy.  Heres the sauce part: <Curtis> cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com    Combine 2 Aji or 3 Jalapen~o chiles, stems and seeds removed and chopped,  1 cup queso blanco or Munster cheese, and 1 cup heavy cream in a blender  and puree until smooth. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and slowly add the  cheese mixture, stirring constantly. Simmer the sauce for 5 minutes or  until it thickens.    If the sauce you remember didnt have cheese in it, try omitting it.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
