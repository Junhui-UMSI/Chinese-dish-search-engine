For a starter course on a warm fall evening, this dish has few peers.    Marinating:  Slice fish with the grain in pencil-thick, 2" strips. Mix  marinade ingredients; blend with fish in bowl. Cover and marinate in  refrigerator for 3 to 8 hours.    Preparations:  Heat oil in wok to medium high. Toss 2 strands of rice stick  noodle in oil to make sure it is hot enough; noodles should puff up  instantly without browning. Deep-fry rice stick noodle briefly until it  expands; drain on paper towels; bag and reserve. Shred lettuce; bag and  reserve in refrigerator. Thinly shred or mince pickled red ginger; reserve.  Chop parsley in 2" lengths. Toast sesame seeds in dry wok at low-medium  heat until they are light tan; reserve in tea cup or condiment saucer.    Assembling:  Slice lemon in wedges.  Separately pile ingredients on large  platter, removing slices of ginger from fish (discard slices). Sprinkle  salad with sesame seeds and toss on platter, squeezing lemon over salad as  you toss.
