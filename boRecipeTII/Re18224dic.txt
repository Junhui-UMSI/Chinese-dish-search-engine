Cook bones in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat 8 minutes or until  very brown, stirring occasionally. Add wine and next 6 ingredients; stir  well, and bring to a boil.    Reduce heat to medium, and cook, uncovered, 45 minutes or until stock is  reduced to 1-1/4 cups.    Strain stock through a sieve into a bowl; discard solids. Add mustard to  stock; stir well, and set aside.    Trim fat from venison.    Sprinkle salt and pepper over venison.    Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add venison,  and cook 15 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 140 degrees  (medium-rare), browning venison on all sides. Remove venison from skillet;  set aside, and keep warm.    Wipe drippings from skillet with a paper towel.    Add 1/2 cup gin to skillet; cook over low heat until warm. Ignite with a  long match. Add stock to skillet; bring to a boil.

Cut venison into 1/8-inch-thick slices, and arrange slices on  top of sauce. To serve, spoon sauce on individual plates.
