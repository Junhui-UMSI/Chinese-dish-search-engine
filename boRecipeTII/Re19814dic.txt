Appetizer Tortilla Rollups (Fat-Free)
Rotel tomatoes with chilies , Flour tortillas, Cream cheese; fat-free, Green onions, 
Mix the cream cheese, rotel tomatoes w/chilies and green onions to make a  paste...you may need a little of the juice drained from the rotel, so  reserve it just in case.    Spread the mixture about 1/4 inch thick on tortillas. Refrigerate for about  an hour before slicing.  For Christmas, you can also tint the mixture with  food coloring.    Serve with salsa, or if you are not worried about fat grams, queso.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #010 by valerie@nbnet.nb.ca (valerie) on Jan  10, 1998
