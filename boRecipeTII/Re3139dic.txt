Add the chicken stock and bring to a  boil.  Reduce the heat and stir in the remaining ingredients.  Simmer the  sauce, uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes until thickened.    Toss meat with mixture until evenly coated.  Marinate the meat at room  temperature for 2 hours.  Thread the meat on skewers and broil or grill  until done, basting once with the sauce. Serve with a side dish of the  sauce for dipping.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #086    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
