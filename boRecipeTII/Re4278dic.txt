Perogy Dough
Flour, Sour cream, Milk, Salt, Eggs, 
Canadian Living, December 1996.    In large bowl, stir flour with salt. Whisk together milk, sour cream and  eggs; stir into dry ingredients just until soft shaggy dough forms. Turn  out onto lightly floured surface; knead for about one minute or just until  smooth. Divide into quarters; wrap each in plastic wrap and let rest for 20  minutes. Makes enough dough for about 7 1/2 dozen perogies.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #374, by Peg Baldassari  <75402.3465@compuserve.com> on 15 Jan 97.
