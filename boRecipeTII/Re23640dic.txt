I prefer the "unglazed"  versions, because I think the hold more moisture, but try these two recipes  for starters...    Place mushrooms, onion, and garlic in cooker.  Coat chicken pieces with  mixture of flour, salt, paprika, and rosemary.  Arrange chicken over  vegetables, and pour in the broth and sherry.  Bake at 450 degrees for one  hour.  Stir in artichoke hearts, and bake uncovered for 10 minutes.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MealMaster recipe list.
