Qn Easy Ribs
Part garlic salt, Part sage, Slab pork spare ribs, Black pepper, 
First of all,  I want to let you know that I love cookin on  the smoker,  but after many years I have modified my techniques (cheatin, if thats what  you want to call it).  Youll see below.    At room temperature rub down a slab of pork spare ribs with a thick mixture  of 3/4 garlic salt, 1/4 sage and 1 Tbls black pepper.  Let em set at room  temperature for 30 minutes.  Then rub again with above mix  and let stand  for 30 minutes. Place spare ribs on smoker, 190 degrees, with meat side up  for 1 hour then turn over for 1 hour. -- heavy white smoke. Take off smoker  and seal in foil then place in oven. Turn oven on to bake and 300 degrees.  When oven reaches 300 degrees turn temperature dial back to 200 degrees for  2 1/2 hours. (do not open door) (Ribs fallin off the bone at this point,  you could eatem with no BBQ sauce) Take ribs out of foil and return to  smoker with the meat side down and spread with BBQ sauce, wait till BBQ  sauce is sticky. Turn over and spread on more BBQ sauce.    When you think they look good -- eat em....
