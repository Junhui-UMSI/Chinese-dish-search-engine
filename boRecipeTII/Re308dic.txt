From our daughter...sorry, dont know where she got it from.    Saute the first 6 ingredients in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the water  and salt, and simmer for 30 minutes. Puree in a blender or food processor,  add the milk, and reheat. Enjoy!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Muriel Harris <harrism@omni.cc.purdue.edu>  on Nov 11, 1998,
