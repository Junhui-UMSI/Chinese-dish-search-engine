Baked Stuffed Zucchini
Walnuts, Eggs, Zucchinis, Fresh basil, Scallions, Soft bread crumbs, Salt, Margarine, Fresh parsley, Mushrooms, Black pepper, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
1. Scrub zucchini and cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out and reserve pulp,  leaving shells 1/4-inch thick. 2. Drop shells into boiling water and boil  for 5 minutes. 3. Chop pulp and saute in margarine. Add scallion (or green  onions) and mushrooms; saute 3 minutes longer. Add nuts and remove from  heat. 4. Beat eggs with parsley, basil, salt and pepper to taste. 5. Add  egg mixture and fresh bread crumbs to pulp mixture. Spoon into zucchini  shells which have been drained. Top with grated cheese. Use your choice of  cheese; Parmesan is only one suggestion. 6. Place into a baking dish which  has been greased with margarine. Add 1/2 inch of water and bake, uncovered,  in preheated 350-degree oven for about 30 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes,  then serve.
