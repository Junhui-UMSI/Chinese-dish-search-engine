Wat Spices (Ethiopian Spices)
Black pepper, Long peppers, Cloves, A pinch of turmeric, Long nutmeg, 
A wat is a traditional Ethiopian stew, spiced either with Berbere or this  simpler blend of spices. The recipe below is taken from A Safari of African  Cooking by Bill Odarty.    Roast spices over a low flame. Pound them in order to break up big pieces.  Place a pinch of turmeric on the grinding stone and grind until a yellow  coating of turmeric is spread over the working surface. Grind all the other  spices together on the yellow grinding stone. These spices are added to the  wat towards the end of cooking.
