Pumpkin Bread 4
Sugar, Salt, Pecans, Baking soda, Canned pumpkin, Water, Cinnamon, Eggs, Vegatable oil, All purpose flour, Nutmeg, 
The Zoji has a cake setting, and I use that.  I add the ingredients wet  first, but I hold the pecans out until I get the beep on the cycle. I had  a problem with the flour not all dissolving, so I also use a rubber spatula  to scrape the sides and corners while its mixing.  I just made four loaves  today for my daughters bake sale and for my office party. I found the  recipe by going to Yahoo-Alta Vista, typing in pumpkin bread, and then  altering a recipe I found so it would be appropriate for a breakmaker.
