Cut the beef into 1/2-inch cubes.  Remove casing from the sausage and  cut the meat into 1-inch pieces.   Chop garlic and parsley together until almost pureed.   Cut the mushrooms into thin slices; or use 1/2 oz dried mushrooms and soak  them in 1/2 cup lukewarm water for 15 minutes. Drain, saving the water, and  chop the mushrooms.     Combine olive oil, butter, and salt pork in a saucepan; heat. Add onions  and saute slowly until medium brown. Add beef and sausage and brown for 10  minutes.  Add garlic and parsley, black pepper and bay leaf. Stir and cook  for 10 minutes.  Add wine, stir, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add  celery, carrot, tomatoes and mushrooms. Stir and cook for 10 minutes  longer.  Add hot water and water from dried mushrooms if any. Stir, cover,  and simmer for 40 minutes.   Grate a little nutmeg over the top and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes  longer.  Test beef for doneness; taste for salt and add if necessary, but  salt pork may have added enough.     Divide the hot polenta among 4 to 6 warm plates.   Serve the stew and gravy over polenta.  Enjoy a bottle of Valpolicella  with it.     Source:  Leones Italian Cookbook.
