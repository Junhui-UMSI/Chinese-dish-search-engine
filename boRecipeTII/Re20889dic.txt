Apple Mulling Spice Mix
Crystallized ginger, nutmegs, orange zest, cinnamon sticks, lemon zest, allspice, 
Cut doubled layers of cheesecloth into fourteen 5-inch squares. Have  fourteen 10-inch-long pieces plain white string ready. Put cinnamon sticks  and nutmegs in a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin or a small heavy  skillet until broken in small pieces. Mix with remaining ingredients. Tie 3  generous tablespoonsful in each cheesecloth square. Makes 14 bags.    To mull wine, stir 1/2 cup water and 1/3 cup sugar in a 1-1/2 to 2-quart  pan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add 3-1/4 cups wine and the  spice bag. Reduce heat to low, cover and heat very gently until mixture is  very hot but not boiling, about 20 minutes. Discard spice bag.    To mull cider, just add spice bag to 8 cups apple cider in a 2-1/2 to  3-quart pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 30 to 35  minutes. Discard spice bag.    (Each spice bag holds enough to mull a 750 ml bottle of red wine - about  3-1/4 cups - or a half gallon - 8 cups - apple cider.)
