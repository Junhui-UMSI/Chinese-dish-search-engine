Guinness Oatmeal Bread
Unbleached white bread, Flour, Whole wheat bread flour, Quick-cooking oatmeal, Cornmeal, Salt, Powdered buttermilk, Flat room-temperature flat, Guinness stout, Maple syrup, Egg whites, Plus 1 T water, Yeast, 
This is a recipe adapted for the 1.5 lb Panasonic Bread Machine.  Its  almost perfected (I think another 1 T of water and/or 1/2 t of yeast would  benefit it).
