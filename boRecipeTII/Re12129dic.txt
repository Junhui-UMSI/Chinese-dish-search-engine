Cut a thin slice from top of zucchini; hollow out and chop up the hollowed  out pieces. Parboil the zucchini shells in salted boiling water in large  skillet for 5 minutes, or til crispy tender; drain on paper towels. Melt  butter or margarine in medium-size saucepan; toss 1 tbs with the bread  crumbs in small bowl and reserve. Saute onion and garlic until soft in  remaining butter in pan; add the chopped zucchini and cook 2 minutes. Stir  in rice, egg, salt, seasonings until blended. Fold in the cheese. Spoon the  cheese-rice filling into zucchini shells; top with buttered crumbs. Arrange  in a shallow casserole and bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes or til  crumbs are golden.    **This can be made ahead and refrigerated when the zucchini is stuffed.  Bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes or until heated through.
