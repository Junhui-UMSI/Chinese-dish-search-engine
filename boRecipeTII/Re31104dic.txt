Banana Sour Cream Loaf
Baking Powder, Eggs, Chopped pecans, bananas, Baking soda, Sugar, Butter or margarine, Salt, Flour, Sour cream, 
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and bananas and  beat until well blended. Sift together flour, baking powder, soda and salt.  Add alternately with sour cream to banana mixture, stirring just to blend.  Stir in nuts. Spoon batter into greased and floured (I just use Pam) loaf  pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 90 minutes or until toothpick comes our clean.  Let stand in pan for at least 10-15 minutes. (We cant wait - we love it  hot as well as cold)    I have family members ho are allergic to nuts - so I make some loaves with,  some without and both are equally delicious.    Another recipe I have calls for 1/2 cup rough chopped maraschino cherries.  I added to above recipe - WOW! Absolutely mouth watering.
