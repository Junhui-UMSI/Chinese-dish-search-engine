Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.    Melt half of the butter in a large skillet. Add the endive and potatoes and  saute until just tender.    Butter a baking dish and strew the shallots over the bottom, with a  sprinkling of salt and pepper. Lay the fish on this bed, pour in the wine  and stock, cover with foil and bake 10 minutes.    Transfer the potatoes and endive to a second baking dish, lay the fish on  top, and cover with foil to keep warm.    Reduce the cooking liquid in the fish pan to a syrup, swirl in the  remaining butter, taste for seasoning, and pour over the fish. Return to  the oven uncovered for a few minutes to give the sauce a glaze.
