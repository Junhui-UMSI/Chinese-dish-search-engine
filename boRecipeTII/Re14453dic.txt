From: esh2@po.CWRU.Edu (Evelyn S. Hlabse)    Date: 19 Mar 1994 13:40:15 GMT  This is from the Betty Crocker Cookbook.  I checked it against my  grandmothers cookbook and other than the half and half it is identical but  the measurements are different since hers were Brtish.  She lived in  Scotland all her life. This is a very good recipe. You can substitute whole  wheat flour with all-purpose flour. As usual if you use self-rising flour  omit baking powder and salt.    Heat oven to 400.  Cut margarine into flour, sugar, baking powder and salt  with pastry blender until mixture resembles fine crumbs.  Stir in 1 egg,  the currants and just enough half-and-half so dough leaves side of bowl.    Turn dough onto lighly floured surface.  Knead lightly 10 times.  Roll or  pat 1/2 inch thick.  Cut with floured biscuit cutter, or pat dough into  rectangel and cut into diamond shapes with sharp knife.  Place on ungreased  cookie sheet.  Brush dough with 1 egg.  Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until  golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet; cool. Split scones.  Spread with margarine and serve with preserve if desired. About 15 scones.
