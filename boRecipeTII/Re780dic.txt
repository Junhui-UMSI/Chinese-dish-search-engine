If youve ever had trouble with your sinuss, this soup is for you! Its  spicy enough to open a clogged nose and tasty enough to make you ask for  seconds. It is named after my friend who invented the recipe;    Make a chicken broth and strain it, reserving the liquid. You need about a  gallon of soup. Shred the chicken meat from the broth and set aside. Dice a  medium onion. Dice 3 cloves of garlic. Dice about 1/2 inch of peeled, fresh  ginger Put these 3 items into a hot frying pan coated with a little oil and  fry until the onion "weeps", that is, releases its juice and starts to  turn a little golden.    Now for the spice portion of the soup: If you can, fresh grind your spices.  They will be more aromatic, fresher and youll get more "zing" in the soup.  If you dont use fresh ground spices, thats ok. Just use what you have.  Into the frying pan full of onion, garlic & ginger grind up and put:  tumeric, chilli powder, corriander, cumin, fennel, black pepper, and red  pepper. Fry up these ground spices for a minute, mixing them in with the  onion, ginger & garlic. Add the frying pan contents to the soup. Add the  chicken to the soup. Cook together on low for about a half hour to let the  flavors blend.    ****of course the spice amounts can be changed to your personal liking*****    Serve this spicy soup with rice or noodles to cut the zing of the spice. It  will clear your sinus just as well!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Ruth & Shel <fritzl@earthlink.net> on Oct  25, 1998,
