Simmer the peaches, habs, garlic, and carrot untill the carrots are tender,  add a pinch of salt and 4 pinches of pepper. spoon the solids into the  blender and add a little bit of balsamic viniger. Thin it out to desired  consistency using stock from the pot.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #211, by Justin Alexander  <justin@waltech.com> on Tue, 14 Jan 1997.
