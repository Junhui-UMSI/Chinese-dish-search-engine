Stus Old English Prime Rib
MSG powder, Black Pepper, Rock salt (ice cream salt), Worcestershire Sauce, Prime rib (per person), Paprika, Salt to taste, 
Rub seasoning into meat. In a large roaster(not aluminum) pour a layer of  rock salt until bottom of pan is completely covered. Lightly dampen the  rock salt with water until salt is just moist. Place the meat onto the salt  in a standing rib position. Then cover prime rib completely with rock salt  and dampen with water. DO NOT cover the roaster. Place in preheated oven at  500 degrees. Roast 15 to 18 per pound (rare 15 minutes). When cooking time  is completed, remove roast. Break rock salt away from meat with a hammer  (hard seal formed)    NOTE: DO NOT use any powder rock salt. I filter the rock salt with  colander. Use only that rock salt that does not sift through the colander.    Prime rib cooked this way becomes fork tender.    Enjoy
