Pumpkin Corn Soup with Ginger Lime Cream
Salt, Cooked pumpkin, White pepper, Chicken Stock, GARLIC CREAM, Peeled and grated fresh, Corn kernels, Heavy cream, Limes, juice and zest only, Garlic cloves, finely, 
This simple recipe is easy to prepare and utilizes two very basic  ingredients in Southwestern cooking:  pumpkin and corn.  It is a delicious,  rich-bodied soup, and the Ginger Lime Cream adds a refreshing zest. *****    In a medium covered pot, cook the corn kernels with a little water until  soft, about 10 minutes.  In a food processor, process the corn until smooth  and run through a sieve and discard the skins.    Combine the corn puree, garlic, salt, white pepper, and stock in a saucepan  and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, add the  pumpkin, and cook 10 minutes while stirring.    In another saucepan cook the lime juice and ginger 2 minutes over medium  heat.  Remove from the heat and pour through a sieve to remove the ginger.  In a bowl, combine the ginger-lime juice, the lime zest (save some for the  garnish), and cream.  Whip until the mixture has soft peaks.    Spoon a dollop of Ginger Lime cream onto each bowl filled with soup and  garnish with the remaining line zest.  Serve immediately.
