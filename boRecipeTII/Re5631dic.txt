Pineapple Stuffing
Crushed pineapple, bread crust, margarine, Eggs, Sugar, 
Here is one from my grandma...it is good hot or cold and goes wonderfully  with ham!    In a large bowl combine...  Mix well and turn into about an 8" casserole (mine is square)    Bake at 350* for about one hour or until golden brown and you can see it  pulling away from the sides of the pan. You can test with a knife to be  sure it is not runny in the middle if you like.  Serve hot or cold. Makes enough to serve about 6 - 8 people.  This is a stuffing for people who do not like stuffing...the kids  absolutely love it!    Posted to bakery-shoppe digest V1 Number 037 by freida  <freezelandfreida@citynet.net> on Apr 18, 1997
