Thai Noodles (Pad Thai)
Sugar, thin angel pasta, Sesame oil, Olive oil, Garlic, Soy sauce, Creamy peanut butter, Dried red pepper, Chili oil, 
Cook pasta until done (al dente); drain and set aside and keep warm.  Combine all the remaining ingredients and mix well. Pour over pasta and  toss. We like to top ours with some thinly sliced carrot, some finely  chopped green onion and some coarsely chopped peanuts.    Posted to Recipe Archive - 08 Sep 96    submitted by: sgjg6566@pipeline.com
