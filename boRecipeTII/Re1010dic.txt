Source: The Jerusalem Post    Cook the noodles for 5 minutes in boiling salted water until barely tender.  Drain, rinse in cold water and drain thoroughly. Peel and slice apples.  Melt 2 tablespoons of margarine in a frying pan. Add sliced apples and  brown well on both sides. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and set aside in  a separate dish.    Melt the remaining margarine and pour 3 tablespoons of it unto the noodles.  Add the lemon, raisins, nuts and salt.    Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add the 4 tablespoons of sugar,  and fold in the yolks. Mix this together with the noodles.    Put half the mixture in the bottom of a greased 33x23x5 baking pan Spread  the apples on top and cover with the rest of the noodles. Drizzle the  remaining margarine on top and sprinkle with a little cinnamon and sugar.    Bake, covered for 30 minutes.    Uncover and bake for another 20 minutes.    It is well worth the effort!
