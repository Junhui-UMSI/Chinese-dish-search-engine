Swedish Meatballs in Burgundy
Milk, Cooking oil, Flour, Black pepper, Dry bread crumbs, Cornstarch, Allspice, Egg, Burgundy Wine, Water, Onion, fresh, Salt, Sugar, Ground beef, Bottled sauce for gravy, Beef Bouillon, 
*Bills Note: Recipe does not say what "Bottled Sauce for gravy" is.  Although from reading the recipe, its my guess that she means Gravy Master  or Kitchen Bouquet or the like. I leave that to your own resources.    Combine meat, crumbs, onion, cornstarch, allspice, egg, milk, and 3/4 ts.  salt; shape into 24 or 26 balls. Drop a few at a time into hot fat; brown  well on all sides; transfer to plate. For sauce, stir flour into remaining  fat in skillet; stir in water, Burgundy, bouillon cubes, 1/2 ts. salt,  pepper, sugar, and enough bottled sauce to make a light brown gravy. (Make  gravy as light or dark as desired.) Cook, stirring until smooth. Put meat  balls in sauce; simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Serve on hot mashed  potatoes, buttered noodles, wilde rice, fluffy instant rice, or a mixture  of white and wild rice; or use for canapes.
