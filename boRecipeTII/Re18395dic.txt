Very Unauthentic Moo Shu Vegetables
Grated Ginger, Plus any other vegetables, Teriaki Sauce to taste(I use, Mushroom Pieces, Hoisin Sauce, Flour tortillas, Green onions Cut into 1 inch, Garlic, Head of Cabbage Shredded, Carrot Shredded, 
Saute all the vegetables and garlic and ginger in Teriaki Sauce until  wilted. Spread some Hoisin sauce on tortilla and top with vegetable mixture  roll and eat.    Caution, have lots of napkins, this is messy. Not the real thing but  tortillas are a good substitute for the pancakes served at Chinese  Restaurants.
