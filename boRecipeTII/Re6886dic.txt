Pomegrenate and Apple Salad

Ive been meaning to send this recipe for quite some time, but am behind in  everything since my daughter came to visit from Israel with her two  children for 2 weeks in August. It is a recipe I cut out from the  Washington Post several years ago and is wonderful for Rosh Hashana.    Break the pomegrenates open from the top and gently separate the seeds into  a bowl. Peel & core the apples and cut each one into bite-size pieces.  Sprinkle the apples with lemon juice to prevent from discoloring. Combine  the mayo and honey in a salad bowl and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the  vinegar, orange juice, salt & pepper. Add the apples, pomegrenate seeds and  raisins and toss to mix. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
