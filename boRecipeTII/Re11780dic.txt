Rauchbier
Liquid smoke, Light dry extract, Red Star lager yeast, Packs, Tettnanger hops (finish), Tettnanger hops (boil), Irish moss, 
Boil extract, liquid smoke, and boiling hops in 2-3 gallons of water for 45  minutes. Add Irish moss and finishing hops and boil 5 more  minutes. Strain  into fermenter, add cold water to make 5 gallons,  pitch  yeast. After 3  days  rack to secondary. Allow to ferment  an  additional  3-4 weeks. This  is basically a nice light beer, but with a definite  smoke  after- taste.  Mainstream, but with a non-commercial twist.
