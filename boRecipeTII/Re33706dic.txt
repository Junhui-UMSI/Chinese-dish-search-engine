Sweet and Savory Bacon Breadsticks
Brown sugar, Plain breadsticks, Bacon, Cayenne pepper, 
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil.  Put a cooling rack on each sheet.    Spiral-wrap 1 slice bacon around each breadstick.    In shallow dish, spread out brown sugar and generously sprinkle with  cayenne. Roll each bacon-wrapped breadstick in sugar to coat, pressing  sugar mixture to bacon as you roll. Place breadsticks on racks.    Bake, turning frequently, until bacon is golden, about 15 to 25 minutes.  Cool on clean racks. Store in airtight containers. Should be made 1 hour  and up to 8 hours in advance.    Notes: At the Association of Food Journalists conference in Washington, we  were taken to the Cannon Office Building, which holds offices for the House  of Representatives, for an afternoon of seminars. The buffet lunch in the  ornate dining room included these clever breadsticks from a caterer, Becky  Hamill & Co. The breadsticks get soft while baking, but they crisp back up  as they cool.
