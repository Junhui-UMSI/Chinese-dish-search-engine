Vegan Gelatin
Fruit juice, Agar agar flakes, INTO A SAUCEPAN, 
stir to disolve, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and simmer 2 - 3  minutes.    Add fruits and pour into a shallow dish, chill.    Note, this may not be quite a firm as Jell-o, but it really tastes good.  Agar agar is a sea vegetable, it is a bit pricey but worth it for this  treat.
