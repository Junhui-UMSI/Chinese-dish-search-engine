The 1970s saw perhaps the biggest change in cooking in this century. Thats  when a group of talented young chefs in France came up with "nouvelle  cuisine," emphasizing fresh ingredients, elegant presentation, and  interesting and unusual combinations of foods and flavors. American chefs  quickly imported it and made it into something uniquely their own. For our  take on this landmark in contemporary cooking, weve shaped purchased puff  pastry into individual tartlet, filled them with pistachio frangipane and  sliced pears, and topped it all off with a sweet-wine glaze.    Combine pear halves and 1 cup dessert wine in heavy medium saucepan. Scrape  in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Bring wine to boil. Reduce heat,  cover and simmer until pears are just tender, turning occasionally, about  10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pear halves to paper towels and  drain well. Boil pear poaching liquid in saucepan until reduced to 2  tablespoons, about 7 minutes. Set glaze aside.    Finely grind 2/3 cup unsalted pistachios and sugar in processor. Add  unsalted butter and egg; blend just until filling is combined. (Can be  prepared 1 day ahead. Cover pears and nut filling separately and  refrigerate. Cover glaze and let stand at room temperature.)    Unfold pastry sheets on work surface; press out folds. Using 4 1/4-inch  scalloped round cookie cutter, cut out four rounds from each sheet. Using 3  1/2-inch round from cookie cutter, cut out one 3 1/2-inch round from each  of four rounds (reserve 3 1/2-inch rounds for another use); set pastry  rings aside. Brush egg glaze over outer edges of four 4 1/4-inch solid  rounds. Pierce rounds all over with fork. Top each with one pastry ring.  Transfer pastries to baking sheet. Freeze 15 minutes. (Can be prepared 1  day ahead; cover and keep frozen).    Preheat oven to 375F. Bake pastries 10 minutes, piercing centers with fork  if centers rise. Remove from oven. Reduce oven temperature to 350F.    Spoon 1/4 of nut filling into center of each pastry. Slice pear halves and  arrange atop filling, covering completely. Bake until pastries are golden  brown, about 20 minutes. Cool pastries at least 30 minutes and up to 1  hour. Brush pears with glaze. Sprinkle chopped pistachios around pears.  Garnish with fresh mint leaves and serve.          4    servings    Bon App?tit November 1993    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Feb 26, 1998
