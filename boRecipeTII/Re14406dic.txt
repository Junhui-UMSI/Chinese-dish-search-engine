Im forever patchkying with challah recipes, and this version came out  really well. Its my first attempt with whole wheat, and even my picky  5-year-old liked it!    Based on Jennie Grossingers recipe from "The Art of Jewish Cooking", but  definitely adapted into a new recipe by me.    Combine yeast, 1 T sugar and 1/4 C water, and allow to stand while sifting  dry ingredients.    Sift flours, sugar, salt, saffron, and cinnamon into large bowl. Make a  well in the center, and add lightly beaten 2 eggs, oil, yeast mixture and  rest of water. Mix until dough peels away from the side of the bowl. Turn  onto oiled and floured surface, and knead for about 5-7 minutes with oiled  hands. Cover and allow to rise until doubled. Punch down, and allow to  double again.    Divide dough into 3, 6, or 9 even parts, and braid into 1 large, 2 medium,  or 3 small loaves. Can be placed in an oiled loaf pan or on oiled or  parchment covered baking pan. Cover and allow to rise until doubled.  Preheat oven to 375^F.    Mix egg yolk, sugar, and water until sugar is dissolved. Gently brush  mixture on top of loaves. Place in oven for 20 minutes. Remove, and recoat  with egg mixture, adding poppy or sesame seed at this time. Continue baking  for another 20-30 minutes, until all are evenly browned and sound hollow  when tapped.
