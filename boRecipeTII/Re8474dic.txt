Thanks to all who re-sent the recipe for the moist dressing and here is a  recipe I recently found in a Sept. issue of Womans World.    Position oven rack in lower third of oven, preheat to 500 degrees. Coat  large baking sheet or 12 inch round pizza pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Combine potatoes, egg white, 1/4 t. salt and 1/4 t. pepper. Arrange  potatoes, overlapping in circle on baking sheet or pizza pan. Bake until  potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Cool crust slightly. Run large  spatula under crust to loosen from pan; set aside. Meanwhile, in skillet  over medium heat cook bacon until crisp, 8-10 mins. drain on paper towels.  Discard all but 1 T. drippings from skillet; heat over medium heat. Add  onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally until onion is tender about 5  mins. Stir in spinach and remaining salt. Combine ricotta, parmesan cheese,  sage and remaining pepper. Spread ricotta mixture over crust in pan. Top  with spinach mixture. Sprinkle with bacon and mozzarella. Bake until  topping is heated through and cheese melts, 8-10 mins . Let stand 5 mins.  before serving. Makes 6 servings. Per serving 276 cals; 16 g. protein, 16  g. fat; 45 mg. chol; 19 g. carbs; 502 mg. sodium    I thought this was a neat variation of pizza and using the potato crust  anyone could come up with their own ideas for toppings.
