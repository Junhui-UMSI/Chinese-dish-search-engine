The Simplest Cobbler
Sugar, Yellow cake mix, Inches fruit juice and fruit, 
Oil the pot with cooking oil. Some use salad oil. If ind it burns to  readily and produces an offensive taste and odor. Pour in about 1 1/2 to 2  inches of fruit juice and the fruit (sweetener mixed in). Sprinkle one or  two dry cake mixes over fruit, keeping it the same depth as much as  possible. I generally use a plain yellow cake mix, but any kind you desire  is okey. Experiment a little with chocolate, lemon or maple nut. Thend rop  some raisins and nuts on top and youre ready to go. Keep the heat medium  to cool on the bottom, hotter on top. Check often as fruit jucies burn  quickly. Usually when it is nicely browned it is done. A toothpick will  verify it.
