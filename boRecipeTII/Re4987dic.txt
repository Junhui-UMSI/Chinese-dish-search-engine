Dissolve salt in 4 quarts water.  Pour over peppers and let stand  12 to 18 hours in a cool place. Drain; rinse and drain thoroughly. Combine  remaining ingredients; simmer 15 minutes.  Remove garlic.  Pack peppers  into hot jars, leaving 1/4" (6mm) head space. Remove air bubbles. Adjust  caps. Process half-pints and pints 10 minutes in boiling water bath. Yield:  about 8 pints.
