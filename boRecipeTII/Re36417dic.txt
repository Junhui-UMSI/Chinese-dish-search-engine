Beer Bread 1
Self-rising flour, Egg; beat w/ 1 Tb water, Sugar; optional, Beer; at room temperature, 
Combine flour and sugar, pour in beer and stir just until dry ingreds. are  moist (about 17 times according to original recipe). Pour batter into  greased & floured loaf pan and let sit for about 15 min. to rise. Dough  will be very gooey. Brush top with egg mixture and bake in pre-heated 375  F. oven for about an hour or until pick comes out clean. When done, brush  top with butter.    I like to add things like 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese and 2 tblsp.  caraway seeds or the cheese and some fresh chopped jalapenos or just use  your imagination. If you add these things, add them to the flour and mix  well before you add the beer.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #803 by Roberta Banghart  <bobbi744@sojourn.com> on Sep 24, 1997
