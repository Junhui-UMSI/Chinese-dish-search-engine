This is really a very basic recipe - and since I have made ww bread for so  many years using many different dough enhancers, etc., I can only conclude  that what makes this recipe so consistently great, is the particular wheat  and perhaps the brand of yeast.    I grind my own wheat which is Hard White Spring Wheat from Montana and I  use Fermipan Yeast.  When I got this recipe from an acquaintance last year  I asked her what her brands she used of everything in the recipe and this  is exactly what I am sharing with you.  It is a lighter colored wheat bread  and has a wonderful flavor that does not leave a bitter sort of aftertaste  that I have experienced with my previous brand.    I grind up 15-16 cups of flour first.  Then I pour into my Kitchen Aid  mixing bowl: 	 	5 cups hot (95-105 degrees) water 	1/2 cup honey (any brand  will work) 	2 Tblsp Fermipan Yeast 	 (If using another brand, you might try  2 1/2 - 3 Tblsp)    Let this sit for a few minutes to "proof" - it will begin to "grow" and  will look bubbly and foamy.    Add.....5 cups of the whole wheat flour and mix for 1 minute.    Add.....1/3 cup oil (any good vegetable oil) 	1 Tblsp salt 	Mix together  another 1 minute    Add.....7-9 cups of flour, until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.    Knead and rise as usualy for any basic bread dough.    This will make 3 very large loaves or 4-5 smaller pan size loaves or it is  fun to make 12 of the very small loaves (maybe 2 1/2 x 3" pans)    >From: Pat Hewitt <hewitt@sequent.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Bon Appetit!
