Turn oven to 350F and cook 1 hour. Remove  brisket from cooking liquid, cover and set aside.

Using covered grill, light about 12 charcoal briquettes  and add small piece of mesquite or other wood. Be sure to place charcoal  and wood to one side of grill. Arrange brisket on grill so that it is not  directly over burning wood. Paint it with some glaze. Place cover on grill  and smoke brisket 1 hour, turning meat and coating with glaze every 15  minutes. Add charcoal or wood, small piece at a time, if fire seems to get  too cold. Remove from grill, thinly slice meat against grain and serve.  Offer any remaining glaze on side.
