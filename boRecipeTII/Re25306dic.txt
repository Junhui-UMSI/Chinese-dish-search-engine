If you dont have a long, narrow fish poacher, an enamel roasting pan 5"  deep will do just as well. Fill the pan with water to a depth of 4" and add  1/2 cup salt. Bring to a boil (over two burners, if necessary), reduce heat  slightly and gently slide the cod slices into the water with a spatula.  Lower the heat until water is bubbling slightly and simmer for about 5  minutes. Be careful not to overcook or the fish will disintegrate. Remove  the slices with a slotted spatula and drain them on a linen napkin or dish  towel. Reserve stock for use in the egg sauce. Arrange cod attractively on  a heated platter and serve with egg sauce. EGG SAUCE: Melt the butter in a  saucepan. Remove from the heat, beat in 1/4 cup of the stock in which you  poached the fish and stir in chopped egg, tomato, parsley and chives. Add  salt and pepper to taste. Heat almost to the boiling point, pour into a  sauceboat and serve with the cod. If you prefer, you can simply pour melted  butter over the cod and garnish with lemon slices and parsley. In Norway,  this dish is often accompanied by raw diced carrots, sprinkled with lemon  juice and new potatoes (see recipe).
