Preheat oven to 475. Butter or oil [or use Pam] a large baking sheet. Cut  potatoes length-wise into 1/2" wedges. Combine chili powder, cumin, salt  and cayenne. In a large bowl toss potato wedges in the spice mixture.  Drizzle with oil [or for less calories a little stock- JW] and toss again  to coat well. Place potatoes, cut side down, on baking sheet. Bake, turning  once, until tender and the skins are crisp, about 20 min.    Sprinkle with cheese, scallions and cilantro. Bake until cheese melts,  about 2 min. Serve as is or with salsa.
