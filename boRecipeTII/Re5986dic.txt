Divide into six balls and knead  each until smooth and elastic. Flatten each to 1/4" thick and 4-5 inches in  diameter. Cover with a damp towel and let rise for 45 minutes. Place upside  down on a cookie sheet and bake at 500 degrees for 10-15 minutes, until  light brown. These work well with whole-wheat flour too.
