Source:  Electric Bread    The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra  knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a lighter  loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset the machine  and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if its available on your  machine.                                 Success Hints                               -------------    If your market doesnt stock wheat gluten, try your local health food  store.    Remember the extra knead (as usual for wheat bread) - its especially  important for 100% whole wheat bread!  You should use only the regular bake  cycle.
