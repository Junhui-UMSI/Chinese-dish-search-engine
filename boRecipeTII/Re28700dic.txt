Texas Short Ribs
Chili powder, celery, Chili sauce, Green bell pepper, Unsalted butter, Salt, Onions, Garlic, Beef short ribs, Dry mustard, Lemon juice, Hot green (chili) pepper;, All-purpose flour, Vegetable oil, Plum tomatoes  , Brown sugar, Ground allspice, Sweet paprika, Dark beer, fresh parsley, 
Heat 3 tablespoons butter with the oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven  over medium-high heat. Brown the ribs well, a few at a time, on all sides.  Transfer to a plate. Reduce the heat and add the remaining tablespoon  butter to the pot. Stir in the onions, garlic and peppers, scraping the  bottom and sides of the pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Sprinkle in the reserved 1 tablespoon flour mixture; cook 2 minutes longer.    Add the celery, brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, mustard, lemon juice,  chili sauce and beer to the pan, stir well and add the tomatoes. Return the  ribs to the pot and heat to boiling. Cover and transfer to the oven. Bake  for 1 1/2 hours, turning the meat once. Uncover and bake 15 minutes longer.  Skim off the fat and sprinkle with parsley.    NOTES : Short ribs, sometimes called flanken, are cut ends of the rib roast  and contain a great deal of fat. The meat is very tender when cooked in the  style of East Texas: stewed in peppers, tomato and beer. If you make the  dish a day ahead and refrigerate it overnight, you can easily remove the  fat from the top HOME ENTERTAINING WITH DEAN FEARING #HE1A10 TAILGATE  Recipe by: DEAN FEARING #HE1A10    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #787 by Sue <suechef@sover.net> on Sep 18,  1997
