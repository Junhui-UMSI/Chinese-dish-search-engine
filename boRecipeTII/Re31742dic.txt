Water; ( hot from the tap), Flour; ( I use unbleached),, Egg for glaze, Eggs; (room temp), Salt, Dry yeast, Oil; (I use canola), Sugar, 
Two loaves, 1 1/2 # each    Place sugar, salt and oil in mixing bowl. Add hot water and stir to  dissolve. Add yeast, stir in and let stand until yeast gets "foamy".Add  slightly beaten eggs.    1. For mixer with dough hook. (should have a capacity of 6 cups of flour)  Add 4 1/2 cups of flour and mix until flour is mixed in and dough gets "  stringy".(gluten has formed). Continue to add flour until dough is all on  doughhook and sides andbottom of bowl are clean. Let hook continue to knead  for several minutes. Dough should be smooth and elastic.    2. For hand kneading. Stir in 41/2 cups of flour. Turn out on a floured  board and knead by hand working in 1 to 2 cups of additional flour until  dough is no longer sticky but is smooth and elastic. (about 8-10 minutes)    Turn out dough into a greased bowl. Grease top and cover bowl. Let rise  until doubled in bulk. ( I punch down after first rising and allow to rise  a second time. The first rising is about 1 hour, the second about 45  minutes). Divide dough in two. Divide each half into three or four parts  depending on whether you do a three or four braid. Braid, place both breads  on a baking sheet, cover, and allow to rise until doubled. Brush withbeaten  egg. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds, if desired. Bake at 350 degrees  for 35 minutes. Allow to cool on a rack.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Ruth Frier" <antruthy@flash.net> on May  13, 1998
