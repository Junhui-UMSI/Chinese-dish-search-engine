Brush a rectangular baking sheet lightly with some of the  butter. Lay 1 sheet of the phyllo on the the butter; brush lightly with  some of the butter. Sprinkle the phyllo with 1 T. of the Parmesan; lay  another sheet of the phyllo on top and press it firmly so that it adheres  to the bottom sheet. Butter, sprinkle and layer the remaining phyllo in the  same manner, ending with a sheet of phyllo and reserving the remaining 1 T.  of Parmesan. Sprinkle the top sheet of phyllo with the mozzarella, scatter  the onion evenly on top and arrange the tomatoes in one layer over the  onion.  Sprinkle the pizza with the reserved 1 T. Parmesan, the oregano,  the thyme leaves, salt & pepper to taste and bake in the middle of a  preheated 375 oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until the edges are golden.  Arrange the thyme sprigs along the pizzas perimeter and with a pizza wheel  or sharp knife cut the pizza into squares. Serves 8 to 10 as a first  course.
