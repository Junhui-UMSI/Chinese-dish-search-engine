I was  11 years old when his first cookbook came out. This is the first recipe in  his    "Cajun Country Cookbook".    In the cookbook, he says "THIS RECIPE IS WORTH    THE PRICE OF THE BOOK".  Hes= right.  Right after the cookbook came out,    everyone was making this and storing it in those large plastic ice cream    cartons.   Within a short while, he started marketing this himself.  Now  you    can find the green cans of this stuff all over the country.  Where Im  from,    this is the only seasoning anyone uses.  That sounds kind of strange, but  try    it and youll see.  Its been a standard around my house for over 20 years.
