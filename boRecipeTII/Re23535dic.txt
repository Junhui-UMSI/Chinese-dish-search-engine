Pour hot water over the rice and let it stand for about 10 minutes. Drain  the rice and rinse well in cold water. Let the rice drain for a few  minutes.    In a mediumsize saucepan with a tightfitting lid, heat the oil over a  mediumlow heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent,  stirring constantly. Add the rice and cook just until the grains are coated  with the oil.    Add the water and cook, uncovered, over a medium heat until the liquid has  been absorbed and small air holes appear on the top of the rice. Do not  stir.    Wrap the lid of the saucepan with a small terry cloth dish towel. Place the  lid tightly over the saucepan so that none of the steam can escape. Set  aside in a warm place for about 20 to 30 minutes, so that the rice can  continue to cook and the grains expand. Stir the rice well before serving.
