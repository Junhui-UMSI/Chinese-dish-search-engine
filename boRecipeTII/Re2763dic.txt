First, combine the butter and sugars. You can a mixer or try it by hand.  Then, add the peanut butter, the eggs, and finally the dry ingredients.    Whats Toms secret to the perfect cookie? Pure ingredients and a great  baking trick. Tom says that he never uses grease, "Use parchment instead.  Nothing sticks to it and it gives the cookies a nice, browning consistency  on the bottom."    Tom forms the cookies using a small ice cream scoop, then pops them into  the oven for about 15 minutes.    When in town, Mr. Clinton gets his special banana-peanut butter version  because hes allergic to chocolate. To have what the President eats, add  sliced bananas to the cookies for the last 2 minutes of baking.    Or, says Tom, when they come out of the oven you can put a Reeses peanut  butter cup on the top, pat it in, and let it cool.
