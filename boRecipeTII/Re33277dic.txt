Basic Roux
Flour (all-purpose), Cooking oil (your favorite, 
(The basis for all stews and gumbos.) Tony Chacheres "Cajun Country  Cookbook"    Heat oil in heavy pot or Dutch Oven.  When oil is hot, gradually add flour,  stirring constantly until well mixed.  Lower flame and continue stirring  until chocolate brown. When roux is chocolate brown, removed from pot and  set aside. If roux remains in the pot it will continue to cook and get too  dark.    Always use warm water to dissolve the roux.    While youre at it, make more than enough as it keeps well in or out of the  refrigerator.    P.S.  The darker the roux the more intense the taste.  I prefer mine the  color of peanut butter.  Posted to bbq-digest V4 #16    Date: Fri, 25 Oct 1996 11:18:22 -0600    From: Robert Lowe <blowe@deq.state.ut.us>
