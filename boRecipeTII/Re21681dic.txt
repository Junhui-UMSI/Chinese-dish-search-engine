Apple Strudel
Sheets phyllo dough, Bread crumbs, Sugar, Butter, Almond slivers, Seedless raisins, Apples, Cinnamon, 
Peel, core, and finely chop apples. Mix with sugar, spices, raisins, nuts,  and 2 tablespoons melted butter. Unwrap phyllo dough and keep between two  dampened tea towels. Place one sheet of dough on a third tea towel. Brush  with melted butter and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Place second sheet of  phyllo on top of first, brush with butter, and sprinkle with crumbs. Repeat  with remaining sheets of phyllo. Spread apple filling, about two inches in,  along one long side of dough, to within two inches of each edge. Filling  should be spread about three inches wide. Fold long side over once to cover  filling, then fold in edges. Continue to roll lengthwise, like a jelly  roll, using towel to help. Brush each roll with butter, and place, seam  side down, on a lightly buttered baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees about  20-25 minutes, until golden. Remove from oven and score top into 1-1/2"  slices with a sharp knife. Cool and cut into slices.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #309 by BNLImp@aol.com (Iara lewin) on Nov  26, 1997
