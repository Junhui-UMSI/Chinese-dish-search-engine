Alamo Chili
Of chili powder, salt and pepper, Pinto beans, Garlic, Stew meat, Onion, Tomato sauce, 
Trim the fat from the stew meat, cut into bite sized chunks and brown it.  Chop the onion and the jalapeno chili. Smash the garlic. Throw every thing  but the beans into a pot, add water and simmer until meat is tender.   Put the beans into a pot with water and bring to a boil, turn the heat  down and simmer till the beans are done.   Eat the chili and stomp the hell out of the beans.   Dont confuse this with "Rebel Chile" which also has the beans stomped out  of it.   I brought this recipe back from Mexico and it was said to be the one that  Mexico used when they taught Texans how to make chili at the Alamo. I  understand that to this day Texans do not put beans in chili.    TL: If it hasnt got a bean it must be Texas.
