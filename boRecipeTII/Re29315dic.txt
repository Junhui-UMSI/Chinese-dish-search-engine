Pick over and rinse the beans.  Add the water and soak the beans at least  12 hours.  Bring the beans and soaking water to a boil. Cover the pan and  simmer for 1 1/2 hours.   Add the salt, vinegar, syrup, brown sugar, butter  and cinnamon stick. Stir to mix. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, or until  the beans are tender.  The liquid should be as thick as a sauce at the end  of the cooking period. If the liquid is not thickened, turn up the heat for  10 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced. Remove the cinnamon stick.  Serve hot.  ** The beans used in this dish are imported from Sweden and can  be found in specialty food shops or Scandinavian markets.
