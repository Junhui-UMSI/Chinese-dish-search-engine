Heres a recipe from The Feast of Santa Fe for posole as a vegetable.  He  also suggests just combining some good red enchilada sauce and canned,  drained hominy, and simmering for 30 min. Another suggestion was to add it  to a green chile-potato soup. Serves 4 as a side dish.    Heat the oil in a 2 qt saucepan; add onion and garlic and cook over low  heat covered for about 5 min (just wilt the onion).    Remove cover, increase heat to medium and add the spices and chile.  Cook  about 1 min, stirring, then add the rest.  Bring to a boil, cover and  simmer for 30 min. The liquid should be only slightly thick, add water if  needed.    NOTE: to prepare frozen posole: add to 2 qt lightly salted, boiling water  and boil for 45 min.  One cup of frozen posole will make 2-3 cups  cooked,  drained posole.  It can be refrozen at this point.    Michael Bowers,  Internet: mikeb@radonc.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
