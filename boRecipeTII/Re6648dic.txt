Sprinkle in the polenta,  stirring all the time. bring back to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer  for 25 mins, stirring frequently. This gets very thick. I sometimes add so  frozen corn while it is cooking.    Spoon the mixture onto a cookie sheet sprayed with no-stick spray, and use  wet hands to pat into a flat square. Leave to set. When it is cool, cut  into squares. Grill in the oven or over hot coals until lightly browned and  crispy and dip into soya sauce!    I also shape these into flat patties and use instead of bread rolls for  soya burgers, or flatten into a pizza pan, add tomato paste, garlic, basil  and sliced onions, tomatoes and lots of mushrooms. Bake in a hot oven until  the topping is cooked, for a lovely pizza!    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #72    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
