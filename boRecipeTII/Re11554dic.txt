submitted by: jmchee@goodnet.com (Marina Cheesman, Phoenix, AZ)  This is an incredibly simple recipe that was developed out of the desire to  serve a "non-caffeinated" drink!    Tea bags: I brew mine in the coffeemaker just like I would brew coffee.  Then I allow the used bags to stay in the tea until serving time.    Place all the ingredients in a large pitcher. Chill. We serve ours with  fruited ice cubes. I reserve enough juices to fill an ice-cube tray and we  place slices of strawberries and blueberries into each cube.
