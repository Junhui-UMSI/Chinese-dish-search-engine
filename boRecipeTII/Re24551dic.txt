Remove  from the heat and gradually blend in the milk and stock. Cook, stirring,  until the soup thickens a little. Add the asparagus, reserving two tips for  garnish, and simmer for 5 minutes. Rub the mixture through a sieve, or  puree in a blender or food processor. Add salt and pepper to taste. Reheat  the soup and pour into two warmed bowls. Garnish with the reserved  asparagus and serve with Croutons. Note: use some of the liquid from the  canned asparagus if it is not too salty.
