Pimiento Cheese Spread
Velveta (softened or melted), Size can Pimentos (mashed), Sugar, 
sprinkle of Black Pepper    Mix together and add enough mayonnaise or salad dressing to make moist and  spreadable (about 1/2 c), adding more sugar for taste.    I soften velveda/pimento in micro for 2 min or so, then use Hellman mayo,  and sometimes a touch of minced fresh onion.
