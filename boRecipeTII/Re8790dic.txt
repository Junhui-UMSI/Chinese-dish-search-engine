"A rich cake based on a French-countryside recipe from restaurant  consultant Rozanne Gold.  Made without butter, and with cocoa powder  instead of chocolate, the cake is like a souffle that rises, then sinks as  it cools."    DIRECTIONS:  ==========  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Line bottom of 8-inch springform pan with  2-3/4-inch high sides with parchment paper.  Spread pan and paper with  vegetable oil spray.  Sprinkle pan with 2 tablespoons sugar.  Finely grind  nuts with 2 tablespoons sugar in processor.  Transfer nut mixture to large  bowl.  Mix in 10 tablespoons sugar and cocoa, then oil.    Using electric mixer, beat egg whites and salt in large bowl until soft  peaks form.  Fold whites into cocoa mixture in 3 additions.  Spoon batter  into prepared pan; smooth top.    Bake until cake puffs and tester inserted into center comes out with moist  crumbs attached, about 30 minutes.  Cool cake in pan on rack about 30  minutes.  (Cake may fall.)  Cut around pan sides to loosen cake.  Remove  sides of pan and cool cake completely.  Sprinkle cake with powdered sugar.
