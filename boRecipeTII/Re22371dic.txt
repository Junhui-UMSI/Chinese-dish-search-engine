Turkish Pilaf
Salt, Vegetable oil, Golden raisins, Split blanched almonds, Shelled pistachio nuts, Chopped dried apricots, Water, Long-grain rice, 
*Ms. Bacon suggests that the rice be rinsed first in order to remove excess  starch.    Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in large saucepan over high heat. Add the rice and  cook, stirring constantly, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until  all the grains are coated. Add water and salt and cover the pan witha  cloth, then with the lid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 15  minutes.    Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry, nonstick skillet. When they start  tto give off their characteristic aroma- in about 5 minutes- they are  ready. Remove the rice from the heat; it should have absorbed all the  liquid. If not, return the rice to the heat uncovered for a few minutes to  finish evaporation. Transfer the rice to a large bowl and stir in the  almonds, pistachios, raisins and apricots.    Serve the rice heaped in a mound on a serving platter; or press it into a  ring mold brushed with oil, then unmold to give rice an attractive shape on  a platter. Decorate with sprigs of fresg greens, such as coriander leaves,  watercress or mache.    NOTES: Serve this dish lukewarm or cold. this dish is commonly served on  Friday nights and festivals.
