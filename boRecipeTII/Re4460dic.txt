Or substitute turkey if you like."    *To make amaretto poundcake, simply sprinkle a couple of slices of  commercial poundcake with amaretto or coffee-flavored liqueur and top each  slice with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Couldnt be easier.    *If you make your own pesto sauce, freeze a batch in an ice cube tray. Once  firm, pop out the pesto cubes, wrap individually and store in a plastic bag  in the freezer. These small amounts come in handy for recipes like this or  you can thaw several cubes when larger amounts are needed.    *When you cant find fresh pesto, buy it refrigerated or frozen. Frozen  pesto thaws quickly at room temperature or in a few seconds in the  microwave.    *REF: QUICK FIX, "Preso: Pesto Chicken," By JOAN DRAKE, Special to The  Times, Wed 5/13/1998 < www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/FOOD/ > Sent by  Hanneman/buster    Notes: MENU * Pesto Chicken Salad * Cherry Tomatoes or Tomato Wedges *  Baguette * Amaretto Pound Cake with Coffee Ice Cream    Recipe by: Joan Drake, *See ref    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Kitpath <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on May 14,  1998
