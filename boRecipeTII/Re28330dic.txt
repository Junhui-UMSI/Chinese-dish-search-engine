Baked Ham and Swiss French Toast Casserole
Ham, Swiss cheese, Mustard, Eggs, Milk, 2% lowfat, French bread, Mayonnaise, 
The night before serving, combine the ham, cheese, mayonnaise and mustard;  set aside. Lightly toast the bread in a toaster. Divide the ham mixture  evely over 4 slices of the bread. Top with the remaining 4 slices. Cut each  sandwich diagonally into 4 triangles. In a well-greased 9-by-9 inch baking  dish, stand each triangle upright on its outside edge, making 2 rows.    In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and the milk and pour the mixture over the  triangles. Cover and refrigerate overnight.    Next morning, preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Bake the casserole,  uncovered, for 35 minutes, until set. Let the casserole stand about 5 to 10  minutes before serving. Slice between the sandwiches, and serve 3 or 4  triangles per person.    >From "Vive La French Toast!" by Gail Greco    Typos by Brenda Adams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com>; mc post 7/9/97    Recipe by: Boydville, The Inn at Martinsburg, West Virginia Posted to  MC-Recipe Digest V1 #663 by Badams <adamsfmle@sprintmail.com> on Jul 09,  1997
