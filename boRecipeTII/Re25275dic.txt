This is SOOOO good.  I make it without the sour cream and it is SOOOO good  without the sour cream that it is probably devine with it. Warning: once  you start cooking this, you should have your accompaniments ready; the  cooking goes pretty fast.  I heat up a toaster oven first and when the time  comes to keep the steak warm, I turn OFF the toaster oven and pop the steak  in (it JUST fits). Combine crushed pepper, butter, and garlic into a paste.  Spread evenly on both sides of the steak. Heat oil in heavy frying pan over  medium high heat.  When very hot, add steak and brown evenly on both sides.  Allow 7 minutes per side for rare, 8 minutes for medium rare, and 9 minutes  for medium. Place steak on a serving platter and keep warm. Deglaze the pan  with the wine and cognac and cook 1 minute. Reduce heat, add cream and  chopped parsley and continue cooking 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.  Season to taste with salt. Carve steak diagonally across the grain into  thin slices.  Pour the sauce over steak and garnish with parsley.
