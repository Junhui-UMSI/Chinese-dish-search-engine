If you would like to make your own graham-cracker  crumbs, pulverize crackers in blender or in food processor with knife blade  attached as manufacturer directs; or place them in sturdy plastic bag and  roll into fine crumbs with rolling pin.    2. In pie plate or bowl, mix crumbs with remaining ingredients. If you  like, set aside 3 tablespoons mixture for topping. With hand, press mixture  onto bottom and up side of pie plate.    3. Bake crust 8 minutes; cool on wire rack. Fill as recipe directs or with  chilled pie filling; top with reserved crumb mixture or garnish as recipe  directs.
