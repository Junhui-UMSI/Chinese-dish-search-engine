Apfelpfannkuchen (German Apple Pancakes)
Vanilla extract, Cooking apples, Confectioners sugar, Flour, Butter, milk, Salt, Nutmeg, grated, 
Preheat oven to 475.  Peel, core and very thinly slice the apples: you  should have approximately 1-1/2 cups. Melt 3 T sp. of the butter over  medium low heat in a small fry pan, and saute the apples until they are  just tender.  Keep apples warm while preparing the batter.    Place a 9 or 10 inch cast-iron skillet in the oven to heat for at least 5  minutes--the pan has to be very hot for this to work. When it is well  heated, add the remaining 2 T sp. of butter to melt and put the skillet  back in the oven;  the butter should be very hot buy not brown when you add  the apples and the batter.    Place the flour, milk, vanilla, salt and nutmeg in a blender and whirl  until smooth.  Remove the skillet from the oven, quickly arrange the warm  apple slices over the melted butter, and pour the batter evenly over all.  Bake for 15 min., reduce heat to 375 and bake 10 min longer. The pancake  will puff and climb up the sides of the pan. Sprinkle with confectioners  sugar, then cut in wedges and serve with maple syrup.    Note:  If you do not use apples, add 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter to the hot  skillet.
