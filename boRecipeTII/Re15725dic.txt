Mix together in a bowl all the dry ingredients including dates and walnuts  (leave out only the buttermilk, honey, orange half and rhubarb). Put the  buttermilk and the honey in the blender. Wash an orange, cut off any price  or brand marks and cut it in half. Cut the orange half into chunks and add  it to the blender, being sure that you have removed all the seeds. Run the  blender until the orange chunks are chopped into little bits. Now add the  buttermilk mixture, along with the rhubarb chunks, to the dry ingredients  and mix well.   Pour immediately into greased cans, filling each can no more than  two-thirds full. Cover the filled cans with aluminum foil, and secure the  foil with a rubber bands. Place them in a large pot, on some kind of a rack  so they are not touching the bottom of the pot. Pour in hot water until the  bottom 2 inches of the cans are covered. Bring to a boil and keep the water  boiling gently for about 1 1/2 hours.   The pot should be covered and there should be a little steam escaping at  all times. Check the pot occasionally to make sure that there is enough  water left.   At the end of 1 1/2 hours, check with a skewer, right through the foil. If  it does not come out clean, cook for another half hour and recheck. When  the loaves are done, take the "hot" cans out of the pot. When you are ready  to serve, uncover a mold, shake the loaf out onto a breadboard and slice  it. Serve warm with butter or cream cheese.
