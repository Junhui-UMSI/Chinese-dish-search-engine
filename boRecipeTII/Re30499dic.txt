Taco Salad (Mr Food)
Cheddar cheese, Ground beef, black olives  , iceberg lettuce, Tomatoes, Dark red kidney beans  , Dry taco seasoning mix, Sweet-and-spicy French salad dressing, Ranch-flavored tortilla, 
In a medium-sized skillet, brown the ground beef with the taco seasoning  mix over medium-high heat, stirring to break up the meat; drain and cool.  In an extra-large salad bowl, layer half of the lettuce, then half of the  cheese, beans, ground beef, tomatoes, and olives. Repeat the layers once  more, then top with the crushed tortilla chips. Before serving, add the  dressing and toss well to coat.    BUSTED BY MEG ANTCZAK 1/21/98    Recipe by: MR FOOD    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Beach Princess<barbra@pipeline.com> on Jan  22, 1998
