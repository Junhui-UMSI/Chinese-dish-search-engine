Tandoori Paste
Chilies (seeds or not is up, Garam masala, Cultures are good), Several pieces chopped fresh, Ginger, Few chopped hot green, Cayenne pepper or paprika, Turmeric, Nonfat yogurt (active, To you), Several cloves garlic, 
In a blender:    Ive been unspecific with the measures, because the balance of spices in  this is kind of up to the cook...there are probably other ingredients  besides these in the commercial tandoori paste, but these are the  essentials as I remember them.    Anyway, to prepare the food, marinate whatever youll be cooking in a  mixture of lemon juice and salt for about 1/2 hr. Then add the lemon  juice/salt to the stuff in the blender and whirl it up. When you lean over  to sniff it should bite back, hard. Pour the tandoori paste over the food,  let it sit for up to two hours. Then (for eggplant slices, for example)  toss on the grill still lightly coated with the tandoori mixture (messy) OR  for something big like a head of cauliflower, wrap in tinfoil, slathering a  lot of the paste over the top before closing it up. Bake until its almost  done, and then open the tinfoil to let it dry out a bit while it finishes  baking.    If you want really bright red, mix some red and yellow food coloring and  paint it onto the food during the lemon and salt phase.    From:    cgibas@wraightc3.life.uiuc.edu (Cynthia J.
