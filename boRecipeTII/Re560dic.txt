Frittata
Onions, Potatos, Rosemary, Salt, Eggs, Cottage cheese, Olive oil, Parmesan or romano, 
it is just like a giant omelet. It can be made with all sorts of vegetable  combinations (and meats, too, if youre so inclined and either dont keep  kosher or are prepared to skip the dairy ingredients).    My basic recipe is dairy. As youll note, it is foregiving.    Saute onions in olive oil (my preference) until they begin to brown. Add  potatos, rosemary and salt. This can all be done the night before and  refrigerated, if you desire. (I often do this in multiples for huge  brunches.)    When ready to cook: heat a bit more oil in a pan, preferably cast iron.  Beat the egss with the optional cottage cheese or buttermilk (I find that  they improve the texture, but they are absolutely not traditional). Then  add the potato-onion mixture, distributing evenly. Cook over low heat until  almost fully set, then top with parmesan and run under the broiler for  30-60 seconds, until lightly brown. Serve hot, warm or cool.    Alternatives: When I make this for a crowd, I do it in the oven rather than  on the top of the stove. Any large ceramic dish works well. At about 350,  it takes 30 - 40 minutes or so to cook. If you have time, run it under the  broiler for that light browning.    Other alternative: Any appealing combination of vegetables works. Ive done  onions, spinach and mushrooms, added portabellas to my onion/potato basic,  done eggplant, red peppers and tomatoes w/ basil, and probably several  others.
