1.  In a large bowl or food processor, dissolve yeast in water.  Add  honey, margarine, salt, dry milk, pumpkin, spices.  Beat well to  blend, then gradually beat in about 4 cups of the combined flours to  make a stiff dough.    2.  Turn dough out onto a floured board and knead until smooth about  15 to 20 min, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking.    3.  Turn dough over in a bowl coated with nonstick spray, cover and  let rise in a warm place until doubled (1 1/2 - 2 hours)  Punch down  dough, knead briefly on a lightly floured board to release air.    4.
