Mix up dressing in small bowl, adding enough water (about 2-3 T) to make it  runny enough to pour over carrots.  Pour over carrots.  This can be served  hot or cold (I think it is a bit better warm - I just nuke it in the  microwave).    You could also steam or blanch the carrots slightly to soften them up a  bit; since I used frozen carrots, this was not a problem.
