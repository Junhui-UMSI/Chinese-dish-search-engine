Source: Jewish Cooking in America by Joan Nathan    Put the carrots in a saucepan with cold water to cover, add the salt and  simmer about 15 minutes till tender (I left the carrots slightly crunchy -  I like it better than completely soft)    Mix together the lemon juice, oil, garlic, peper, cumin, and paprika and  pour it over the carrots. Refrigerate it for a day or two, sprinkle it with  parsley and serve.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by syschwartz@juno.com (Sarah J Schwartz) on  Sep 23, 1998,
