1. My favorite tomato thing to freeze is what Marian Morash (THE VICTORY  GARDEN COOKBOOK) calls Tomato Fondue or Tomato Coulis. I make it in big  batches and freeze in 1 pint portions and it brings just a delicious taste  of lovely fresh tomatoes all winter long. I use it for many things, but my  favorite use, other than for pastas, is as a light sauce for stuffed bell  peppers. Much better, and tastier than the heavier pasta-style sauces  usually used. Its also good on scrambled (or otherwise cooked) eggs, baked  potatoes, etc.    Chop enough fresh, ripe tomato pulp (skinned) to make three cups pulp.    Saute 2-3 Tbsp. minced onion in 2 Tbsp. butter. (Or use shallots.) Add some  minced garlic and then add tomatoes. Cook over medium-high heat for 4-5  minutes to evaporate the juices and thicken the sauce. Season with salt,  pepper, and herbs to taste, such as basil, oregano, thyme, etc. For  freezing, though, I leave the herbs out until sauce is thawed and reheated  for serving. Freeze in tightly sealed containers, filled up to 1-inch  expanding space.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by KrisE56749@aol.com on Aug 18, 1997
