Cannellini Soup
Extra Virgin Olive Oil; Note, Garlic, Cannellini Beans; Cooked,, salt and pepper, Nonfat Vegetarian Beef, Chopped Fresh Flat-Leaf, Toasted Thick Crusty Bread, 
Note 1: Original recipe used 1/2 C extra virgin olive oil    Note 2: Original recipe used 1 C homemade beef broth or 1/3 C canned beef  stock diluted with 2/3 C water. I used vegetarian nonfat beef broth.    There is very **little** liquid in this soup, but if you like more liquid  then you can add more broth or water.    Put the oil and garlic in a saucepan. Cook over moderate heat, stirring,  until the garlic is a pale gold. Add the beans and a pinch of salt and  pepper. Cover and cook gently for 5 min.    Transfer 1/2 C of the beans to a food mill or processor or blender, add the  broth and puree back into the pan. Simmer the soup for 5 min, then season  with salt and pepper. Swirl in the parsley. Ladle the soup over the toasted  bread and serve.    This was very good!! It was quite filling and had good flavor. We used  untoasted french bread.
