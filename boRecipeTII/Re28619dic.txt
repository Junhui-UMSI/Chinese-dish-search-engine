Cook and stir  the sausage, onion and the bell pepper strips in a 10-inch skillet over  medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sausage is done, about 10  minutes; drain and reserve.  Heat 1 Tbls of margarine in a skillet over  medium heat until hot and bubbly.  Pour eggs into skillet.  As the eggs  begin to set at the bottom and sides, gently lift cooked portions with a  spatula so tha the thin uncooked portion can flow to the bottom.  Avoid  constant stirring.  Cook until the eggs are thickened throughout, but still  moist, about 5 minutes.  Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Spoon about 1/4  cup sausage mixture onto each of the tortillas; top each with about 1/4 cup  of the eggs and 2 Tbls of the cheese mixture.  Fold tortillas into halves.  Arrange 5 assembled tacos in ungreased jelly roll pan 15 1/2 X 10 1/2 X  1-inches; brush with melted margarine.  Bake until light golden brown,  about 10 to 12 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining tacos. Serve with the  guacamole and salsa.    Miscellaneous recipes from the collection of Mike Orchekowski.
