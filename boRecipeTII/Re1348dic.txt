Serves 8    This recipe is from THE AMERICAN VEGETARIAN COOKBOOK by Marily Diamond. She  uses a Tablespoon of oil in the original but I never have. I also have to  double the recipe when I make it. My family eats several bowls for each  person, so it doesnt last long.    Posted to fatfree digest by afisher@osh.earthreach.com (Albert Lee Fisher)  on Nov 10, 1998,
