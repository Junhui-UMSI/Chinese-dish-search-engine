Sift flour once, measure 4 cups; add baking powder and sift together 3  times. Cream shortening, add sugar gradually; cream together until light  and fluffy. Add flour alternately with milk, a small amount at a time,  beating after each addition, until smooth. Add almond extract. Beat egg  whites until they hold up in moist peaks. Stir quickly but thoroughly into  batter. Bake in 4 greased, floured 9 inch layer pans in a 375 degree oven  for 20 to 25 minutes. Cover with desired filling. This recipe can be used  as two layer cakes.     To make filling: Melt butter in double boiler; add sugar. Slowly add the  beaten egg yolks. Cook in double boiler until it begins to thicken, then  add lemon juice. Continue cooking until it is as thick as cream. Remove  from heat; beat until thick. Spread on cold cake.
