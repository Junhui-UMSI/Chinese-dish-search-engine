Syrian Meat Pies
Pomegranate juice, salt and pepper, Ground meat, Pillsbury Buttermilk, Lemon juice, 
Mix all ingredients (except for the bisquits) and let marinate overnite in  the fridge.  As mom described it..."well see what it says in the morning"!    Open the bisquit package, and let them get to room temp.  Coat a cookie  sheet with oil, and press those biscuits into 6 inch pies, using more oil  to lubricate them with your fingers.  Fill the pies with the meat mixture,  and turn over the ends slightly.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes,  or until browned.  These are great to make ahead of time...they freeze  well, and can be nuked for a lunchtime snack.
