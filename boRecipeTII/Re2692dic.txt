From: romuld@mercury.cs.umanitoba.ca (Lynne Romuld)    Date: 3 Jan 1994 22:27:51 GMT  Heres my recipe for Peanut Butter Balls.  Mix together well and form into  small balls.  Freeze well.    Melt chocolate in a double boiler, add parrafin (sp?) wax.  Once completed  melted together dip balls into chocolate and put on wax paper to harden.  I  just measure the chocolate/wax by guesstimate. :-)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
