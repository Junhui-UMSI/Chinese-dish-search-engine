from D. Ornish - Eat More Weigh Less. (This is probably closest to those  you can buy)    Slice the tofu into 4 slices lengthwise. Set aside. In a flat pan or  nonstick baking dish just large enough to hold the slices in a single  layer, combine the lime juice, soy sauce, honey, ginger, garlic and chili  sauce. Place the tofu in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 2 or up  to 6 hours, turning occasionally.    Preheat the oven to 350F.    Remove the dish from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature. Bake  for 45 minutes.    Makes 4 servings.    Per sv: 108 cal; 2g fat; 1054mg sodium.    NOTE: There is now a lower fat tofu on the market which would lower the fat  content (I dont mean Mori-Nu - Im not sure of the brand - maybe White  Wave?). Also, I like to press the tofu before I use it (see next recipe) .  Posted to fatfree digest by "Richard M. Swanson" <sharpy@sedona.net> on Apr  30, 1998
