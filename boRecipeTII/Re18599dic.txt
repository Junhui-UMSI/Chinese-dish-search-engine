American Goulash
elbow macaroni, Ground beef, Onion, green bell, mozzarella cheese, Water, Spaghetti sauce, Garlic salt, Black pepper, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef, bell  pepper, and onion over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring to  crumble the beef, and cook until no pink remains in the beef; drain off the  excess liquid. Add the remaining ingredients except the cheese; mix well.  Place in a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish that has been coated with nonstick  vegetable spray; cover and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and  top with the mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, for 15 to 20 more minutes,  or until heated through and the cheese has melted.    NOTE: This is a perfect dish to make ahead and freeze. You can even freeze  it in individual portions. That way the kids can microwave a dish after  school or anytime they need a quick meal.
