Killer Jerky
Soy sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, Water, Salt, Pepper, Onion powder, Garlic powder, Tabasco sauce, Liquid smoke, 
Mix all together and let sit for about an hour. Stir once in awhile.    Get about 3-4 pounds of the cheapest, leanest meat you can find.  I like  flank steak or arm roast, but they arent very cheap.  Put it in the  freezer for a couple hours. Its easier to slice properly when its partially  frozen. Slice the meat WITH, NOT AGAINST the grain of the meat. Slice into  strips 1/8 - 1/4 inch thick. TRIM AS MUCH FAT OFF AS POSSIBLE. Dip the meat  strips in the sauce with a stirring motion to cover the meat with the  spices.  Layer the meat in a pan.  Pour the remaining sauce over the  layered meat and marinate overnite.    Drain the meat, trying to keep as much spice as possible on the meat  strips.  Place on a drying rack or oven rack and heat about 175 degrees for  about three hours.  The meat should be dry and leathery, not brittle.
