Potato Hamburger Cabbage Casserol, Pk Lake
Pepper, Sharp cheddar cheese;, Cabbage, cheddar cheese, Lean ground beef, Spaghetti sauce, Potatoes, Salt, 
In a large baking dish place a layer of potatoes and cheese .Bake at 350  degrees for 20 minutes.    Brown meat and drain while potates and cheese is baking, add the shredded  cabbage and stir togethers until cabbage is mixed with beef. Add spaghetti  sauce to this mixture. Add meat and cabbage mixture to potatoes.    Top with 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese.    Bake 20 minutes more.    The left overs are excellent the next day for the seasoing blend togethe.    NOTES : At times I will use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound fresh sausage  in place of the two pounds of ground beef. Also instead of the cheddar  cheese I will use a blend of mexican cheese with jalapano peppers.
