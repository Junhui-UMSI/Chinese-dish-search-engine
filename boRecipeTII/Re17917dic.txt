It  goes exceptionally well with Deep Fried Wheat Bread, a raita and Pumpkin  with Onions and Fenugreek."    Cook the potatoes until tender. Peel and set aside. In the container of a  blender or food processor, mince together the onions, garlic and ginger. In  a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the  asafoetida (if used) and cumin. When spices darken (1 to 2 seconds) add the  minced onion mixture and saute until browned (about 12 minutes). Add the  salt, cayenne, tumeric and tomatoes and cook until they soften (about 5  minutes). add the peas and water; reduce the heat to low, cover and cook  for 5 minutes. Halve the cooked potatoes if they seem too large. Add them  to the pan and cook covered for another 5 minutes. Mix in the garam masala  just before serving.
