Deep-fried squid is one of the most popular seafood dishes in the world. It  is made in almost every country where squid is eaten. Once you taste it,  youll see why. The rings emerge juicy, sweet and crisp.    Served with several dipping sauces, this dish makes an excellent hors  doeuvre or main course. This recipe calls for a dry coating. Wet coatings,  such as tempura batter, are delicious, too, though they are a little more  trouble to apply.    Dry the rings thoroughly with paper towels. Coat with flour, to which salt  and pepper have been added.    Heat oil to 350F in a deep-fat fryer or heavy casserole. If you dont have  a temperature control or thermometer, you can guess at the temperature by  dropping a few drops of water into the oil. It should sizzle immediately on  contact. Plunge basket laden with one layer of squid into oil which should  bubble vigorously on contact. If you dont have a basket for deep frying,  use a large spoon or tongs to immerse squid in oil, and to remove. Fry  until coating turns golden brown, about 3 or 4 minutes.    Remove squid and drain. Turn down heat to moderate until just before you  are ready to cook the next batch; oil will overheat when the fryer is  empty. Remove excess oil from squid with paper towels.    Serve rings hot with any of the dipping sauces described below or with  lemon wedges. Cole slaw is a natural with deep fried squid.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; February 22 1993.
