For cake, beat eggs and sugar until thick and lemon colored. When at  ultimate volume, gently mix in flour by hand. Spread batter on a 20x20-cm  baking tray and bake at 400C (200F) for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from tray,  and cut into three pieces 18/12-cm each. To make filling, beat together egg  yolks, sugar, Tia Maria and vanilla. Soften gelatin in cold water, remove  and melt over stove until completely dissolved. When egg mixture has  reached full volume, stir in gelatin. Add mascarpone cheese and mix at high  speed until mixture is a soft cream. Combine first four ingredients for  topping. To assemble: spread two slices of sponge cake with filling and  stack. Top with remaining layer of cake, then spoon topping mixture over  all.  Sprinkle with powdered cocoa (optional) and serve cut into squares.    From the Post Hotel, Lake Louise, Alberta    Calgary Herald, December 4, 1991 From: Fred Towner Date: 08-03-93
