Pour  the cider over the chicken and marinate overnight in the refrigerator,  turning the pieces occasionally. (sometimes I only marinate for a couple of  hours)    2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    3. Remove the chicken from the cider but reserve the cider. Mix the flour,  ginger, cinnamon, and salt and pepper to taste in a shallow bowl. Dredge  the chicken with the flour mixture and place skin side up in a shallow  baking pan.    4. Bake the chicken for 40 mintues.    5. Meanwhile combine the reserved cider, the brown sugar, applejack, and  apple slices.    6. Pour the marinade mixture over the chicken and bake 25 minutes more,  basing occasionally with the pan juices.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #017    From: "Barbara S.
