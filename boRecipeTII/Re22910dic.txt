Add the onion and green pepper  and saute until both are wilted, about 5 minutes.  Remove from pan and set  aside.    Put the minced and cubed beef into the saucepan and saute throughly until  cooked, about 10 minutes. Drain off fat and put cooked green pepper and  onion back into pan with the beef.    Add the chicken stock, arbol chiles, cumin, chili powder, garlic and salt  and pepper to taste. Simmer over medium-low heat until most of the liquid  has evaporated, about 1 hour.    Serve with white beans or pasta, either combined with the chili or on the  side.  Serves 4.
