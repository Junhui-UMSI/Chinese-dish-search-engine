Wash the sorrel and dry it well, by hand or in a salad spinner. Chop the  sorrel coarsely, and again squeeze away any liquid.    Blend the sorrel, shallots, pine nuts, parsley, chives, orange peel and  onion in a food processor or blender. (If using a blender, make sure these  ingredients are already finely chopped.)    Add dry mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne, and mix again. SLOWLY drizzle  in the oil while the blade is moving. Transfer to tempered glass jars and  store in refrigerator (for up to 8 to 10 weeks) or in the freezer for up to  a year.    NOTES:  Sorrels peak season is summer, although you can find hothouse  sorrel year round in some stores. You may reduce the amount of orange peel  by 1/4 or 1/2 if youd like to emphasize the sorrel or other flavors.  Walnuts or almonds may be substituted for the pine nuts.
