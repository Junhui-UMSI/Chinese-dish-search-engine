Potato Salad Dressing

* I use reduced fat mayonnaise instead of fatfree because I think the  fatfree is totally tasteless and why bother.  I make this very rarely, so I  justify the use of the mayonnaise to myself.    This is better if you make the potato salad ahead of time and let it sit  over night in the fridge so the tastes can marry well.    I hope you enjoy it!    DB    From:    DBONGIORNI@a1.pbs.org.
