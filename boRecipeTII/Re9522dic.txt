When hot, add butter,  let it melt and then turn dark brown - not burned. This will add a  wonderful flavor to the crust. Pour into processor and turn machine on to  incorporate the melted butter. Butter the sides of a 10" springform pan,  put the crust mixture into it and press down to form a solid bottom layer.  In an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until it is very smooth, scraping  down the sides of the bowl frequently to ensure a smooth mix. Add the sugar  and beat again till smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, then the yolks, mixing  well after each addition. Add the sour cream, vanilla, pumpkin and spices  and mix again, scraping the bowl to keep that mixture smooth. Taste - you  may want to add more spices. If so, do it now and mix again. Preheat oven  to 275F and bake it for 2-1/2 hours. Remove from oven and immediately run  knife around the cake, about 2" deep, to release it a bit from the pan and  reduce risk of cracking. Let cool to room temperature on rack. If cake has  cracked - dont worry. At this time of year there are beautiful flowers and  leaves that would look wonderful on top of the cake. Buy some rusty colored  mums, wash the stems well and place them strategically over a crack. Also  use lemon leaves or rose leaves. If you want to get fancier, make chocolate  leaves - and "hope" the cake cracks so you can put them on top!
