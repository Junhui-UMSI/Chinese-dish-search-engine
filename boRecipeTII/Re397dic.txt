Lemon Confit
Lemons, Sugar, 
This is a delicious condiment that goes great with seafood, lamb, poultry,  and just about everything else. Use it as you would a chutney or relish.  Its also good with many vegetables and in salads.    Boil the whole lemons in enough water to cover for 15 minutes. Drain and  set aside to cool. In a small stainless steel saucepan combine the sugar  and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil, stirring to make sure all the sugar is  dissolved. Reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes. Cut each lemon into 8  wedges and add to the syrup. Simmer about 15 minutes, until the lemon skin  is tender. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for 1 hour. Place the  lemon wedges and syrup in a covered container. They will keep refrigerated  for several weeks. Allow two wedges per serving.
