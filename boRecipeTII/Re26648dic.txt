Baileys Beef Stock
Water, Ribs celery; cleaned, Tomato paste, Thyme; leaves, Garlic, Parsley sprigs, Onions; cut in half, Mixed beef and veal bones, Carrots; scrubbed, Peppercorns, 
Preheat oven to very hot, about 500F degrees. Place bones in a single layer  in a roasting pan, break carrots and celery into large pieces and sprinkle  among the bones, ditto with the onions. Roast for 30 to 45 minutes until  meat, bones, and vegetables begin to brown, even burn a little. Dump these  into a deep stock pot. Pour about a half inch of water into the roasting  pan and dissolve any bits which have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Pour  over bones. Add more water to several inches above bones. Bring to a boil  and stir in tomato paste. Add parsley, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic.  Cook, barely simmering, for several hours, adding more hot water as  necessary. Strain and boil slowly until reduced and flavor is intensified.  Allow to cool and skim any fat from the top.
