Pat the turkey fillets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and  pepper.    You will probably need to sear the turkey in batches so that it will  brown.  Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Spray  one side of the turkey fillets with Bakers Joy. Cook 1-2 minutes or  until golden. Spray the remaining side, turn and cook for an  additional minute. Hold seared turkey fillets on a warm plate and  repeat with remainder.    Add the raisins, wine, capers and chicken broth mixed with cornstarch  to the same pan, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Return  turkey to the pan to heat.    Serve turkey on individualy plates with sauce spooned over the top.  Sprinkle each portion with toasted pine nuts.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
