Creamy Reduced-Fat Mashed Potatoes
Russet Potatoes, Olive, Low-fat Sour Cream, Salt, Black Pepper, Reserved liquid, 
The Cook & Kitchen Staff will be offering you four different Thanksgiving  Day Dinner menus during the month of November, and were about to begin our  second recipe collection, featuring "Thanksgiving Day Dinner ~ Light"  cooking.    Todays recipe is for the traditional serving of mashed potatoes, less some  of the fat. Our creamy potatoes still taste great, but each serving  contains only 126 calories, 1 gram of saturated fat, and 4 grams of total  fat. Potatoes are naturally rich in vitamin C, beta carotene, and  potassium.    If your holiday dinner table has more people wanting less, then our  "Thanksgiving Day Dinner ~ Light" recipe collection is for you and your  guests.    Place the potatoes in a large cooking pot and cover with lightly salted  water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and  boil for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are very tender. Drain the  potatoes, making sure to reserve about 1 cup of the cooking liquid.    Either pass the potatoes through a ricer or mash them in the original  cooking pot. Stir in the oil, sour cream, salt, and pepper until well  blended. Mash or rice again, gradually stirring in some of the reserved  cooking liquid, until the potatoes are creamy and smooth. Serve warm.    Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by Recipe-a-Day  <recipe-a-day@bignetwork.com> on Nov 6, 1998,
