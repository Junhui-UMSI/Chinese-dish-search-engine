Pommes Soufflees
Idaho potatoes, Vegetable oil; preferably, Salt, 
Peel the potatoes.  Shape them into smooth ovals with a mandoline, slicer  or knife. Cut into 3/8" rounds or the thickness of a half dollar. Pour the  oil to a depth of 5" in 2 deep frying pans. Heat 1 pan until the  temperature reaches 350 F and the other 400 F. Take about 10 slices at a  time and drop them one by one into the 350 F oil. As you do this, slide the  pan back and forth on the burner to make sure the slices are cooking  separately. Remove when they began to swell, which should take about 8 to  10 minutes. Using a skimmer, transfer these slices into the 400 F oil. They  should puff immediately. After they puff up, place them on a linen napkin  to drain. Discard any that do not puff up. Finish putting the potatoes in  the 400 F oil until you have used them all. Salt to taste and serve. and  serve.
