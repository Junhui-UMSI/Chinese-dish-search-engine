Vevas Corn Casserole
Cream-style corn, cheese, Whole kernel corn, onion, salt and pepper, Butter, macaroni, uncooked, 
So Im sending along some of favorite foods my Mom used to fix in the 40s  and 50s. Her name is Veva.    Do not drain corn. Combine all ingredients in large casserole. Bake  uncovered for one hour at 325 F. Stir once after 30 mins. of baking. Posted  to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #209 by "William & Evelyn Hall"  <wchall@nevia.net> on Aug 30, 1997
