Penne with Vodka and Spicy Tomato-Cream Sauce
Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Plump fresh garlic, Vodka, Dried Italian tubular pasta,, Sea salt, Fresh flat-leaf parsley, peeled Italian plum, Crushed red peppers, Heavy (whipping) cream, 
In an unheated skillet large enough to hold the pasta later on, combine  oil, garlic, crushed red peppers and a pinch of salt, stirring to coat with  oil. Cook  over moderate heat just until the garlic turns golden but not  brown, 2 to 3 minutes. If using whole canned tomatoes, place a food mill  over the skillet and puree tomatoes directly into it. Crushed tomatoes can  be added directly. Stir to blend, and simmer, uncovered, until sauce begins  to thicken, about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning.      Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil. Add  3 tablespoons salt and the penne, stirring to prevent sticking. Cook until  tender but firm to the bite. Drain thoroughly.     Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss. Add the  vodka, toss again, then add the cream and toss. Cover, reduce the heat to  low for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the pasta to absorb the sauce. Add the  parsley and toss again. Transfer to warmed shallow soup bowls and serve  immediately.
