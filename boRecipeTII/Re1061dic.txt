Cookie Icing
milk, Light corn syrup, 
This is the best cookie icing recipe I have ever found. It dries hard and  shiny and stays on the cookies without cracking off when you bite into it.  It has been in the "Wilton Cake Decorating Yearbooks" every year forever.    Mix the sugar and milk thoroughly. Stir in the syrup and mix well. Colour  as you like and "colour" your baked cookies. Thin with small additions of  more corn syrup if needed.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Peggy Geromette" <pegger50@hotmail.com> on  Oct 20, 1998,
