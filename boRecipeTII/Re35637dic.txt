Stuffed (Or Smothered) Zuchinni
Ground beef, Seeded, Romano cheese, Zuchinni -- per person, "Manwich" mix, 
Brown the meat.  Drain off the fat.  Add the Manwich mix per instructions  on envelope. Microwave the zuchinni (5 min for me) to tender. Put cooked Z  on plate and fill to overflowing with Manwich prep. Top with Romano.    Recipe By     : JohnT6020    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
