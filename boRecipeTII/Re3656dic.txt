1. Clean a fresh duck and pump it full of air through the neck to       separate the skin from the meat. (At home, a bicycle pump may be       used.) Pour boiling water over the duck three times. Carefully       dry duck, slit stomach, and remove innards.       2. Prepare marinade of hot water, maltose, and vinegar. Rub       outside of duck all over with the mixture.       3. Hang the duck by its neck at room tempera- ture, about 65       degrees, for at least 12 hours.       4. The next day, pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Place duck in       pan and cook for 10 minutes. Turn heat to 450 degrees F and cook       for additional 30 minutes or until the meat is tender and the       skin is crispy.       5. To carve the duck, place it breast side up and cut downwards       towards the head. Slice thinly. Use only the outer slices-those       which have skin. Slice both breasts. Slice the legs, cutting from       the joint to the end of the leg. Discard remaining meat (without       skin) or use for another dish. (See part 2 for more)
