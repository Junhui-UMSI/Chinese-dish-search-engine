In New Orleans, Red Beans and Rice has evolved into a traditional Monday  dish, but its a fine accompaniment anytime for fried chicken, pork chops,  ham, or sausage. ~------------------------------------------------------  ~----------------- In a large saucepan combine the dried beans and the  water, cover, and soak overnight. Add the pork, bacon, or ham and bring to  a simmer. Cook, covered, for 15 minutes.    Meanwhile, in a medium skillet heat the oil and saute the onion and garlic  for 3 minutes or until golden. Add the mixture to the beans along with the  parsley, salt, and Tabasco sauce. Cover and simmer 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours  longer, or until the beans are tender enough to mash one easily with a  fork.  Add hot water as needed to keep the beans covered, and stir  occasionally.  When the beans are finished they will have soaked up most of  the liquid.  Serve over the hot cooked rice.
