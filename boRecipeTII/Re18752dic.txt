Soak the beans overnight in water to cover.  In the morning rinse the beans  with cold water and place in a large pot with fresh water to cover. Stir in  the salt, cover and simmer slowly 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until the beans are  tender.  Add water when necessary and stir occasionally to prevent the  beans from burning. Add hominy and simmer, covered, 1 hour, stirring  occasionally.  The hominy and beans should be very soft and moist, but not  too watery. While the beans and hominy are cooking, roast, peel, seed and  dice the chiles. Sprinkle on top of the cooked beans for garnish.
