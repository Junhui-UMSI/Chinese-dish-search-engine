Pick over rice and dal to remove any pebbles or dirt. Process in a food  processor or blender until a coarse flour, about 5 minutes. Mix ground  mixture with water, yogurt, and salt in a bowl. Cover with plastic and set  aside in a warm place at least 12 hours or as long as 24 hours. When ready,  batter should be smooth and foamy, a bit thinner than pancake batter.    Just before cooking, add tomatoes, serrano chiles, red onion, and cilantro  to batter. Stir to combine.    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small, wellseasoned castiron skillet over high  heat until medium hot. Pour in 1/3 cup batter, reduce heat to low, and  spread batter evenly with a ladle or spatula. Fry until well browned, about  2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat this procedure, heating an additional  tablespoon oil each time, until all batter is fried. Stack pancakes between  layers of aluminum foil in a roasting pan and keep warm in a 200 degree F  oven.    To serve, arrange 2 pancakes on each plate and top with yogurt, tomatoes,  and cilantro. For smaller servings, slice each pancake into quarters and  serve with garnishes for dipping.    Yield: 8 servings or 64 canapes TAMALES WORLD TOUR SHOW #WT1A13    Recipe by: Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #807 by Holly Butman  <butma001@acpub.duke.edu> on Sep 26, 1997
