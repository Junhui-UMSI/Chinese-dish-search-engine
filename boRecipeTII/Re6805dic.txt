Pollo En Vino Rojo
olive oil, 3lb fryer chicken, cut up, Onion, Salt, Bacon, cut up, Carrot, chopped (1/2 cup), Dry Red Wine, Garlic, Vinegar, Dried oregano, crushed, Bay leaf, Can tomatoes, choped, 
In a deep bowl, place the chicken, vinegar, oil, onion, garlic, bay leaf,  oregano, salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Allow this mixture to marinate in the  fridge for about 8 hours, or overnight.  Fry the bacon in a frying pan  until crisp, then remove bacon, but reserve the fat. Allow bacon to sit on  some paper towel, to soak up the fat.  In the bacon grease, brown the  pieces of chicken for about 15 minutes or until well browned. Take the bay  leaf and clove of garlic out of the marinade, then pour the liquid over the  chicken in the skillet.  Add the tomatoes in their liquid, the carrots and  the red wine.  Cook for 35-40 mins., covered and on a low heat. Remove the  chicken to a warmed serving platter, add the bacon to the sauce in the pan  and season the sauce to taste, with salt and pepper. Spoon sauce over the  chicken. Source:  Adapted by Deborah Kuhnen from "Better Homes and Gardens  Mexican Cookbook".
