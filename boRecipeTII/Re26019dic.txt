No eggs, no wheat, no dairy foods-and favored even by those who can handle  all of these. Almond-topped tofu tarts are high in protein and rich in  dynamite nutrients, and tbough they are low in calories, they taste like a  zillion!    To make the filling, first drain the tofu by cutting it in cubes and  placing the cubes on a folded dish towel. Place another towel on top. Place  a cookie sheet or an oblong cutting board over all, then add about 3 pounds  of weight. (Use jars of water or cans from the pantry.) Let stand for 10 to       15    minutes.    While the tofu is draining, cook the figs or raisins in the apple juice  until they are soft-about 10 minutes. In food processor or blender, puree  the fruit with the orange luice concentrate  Add the orange rind, tahini, vanilla, honey, and drained tofu. Blend until  smooth and creamy. Set aside.    To make the crust or bottom layer, mash the banana in a flat soup bowl. Add  the ground sunflower seeds, coconut, cinnamon, and allspice.    Preheat oven to 3500F    Line the cups of three muffin tins with paper liners (1 dozen in each).  Place a teaspoon of the banana mixture in the bottom of each, and then a  heaping tablespoon of tofu filling. Top each with sliced almonds.    Bake for 20 minutes.    Yield: 3 dozen.
