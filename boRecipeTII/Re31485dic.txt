Barbecue Sauce (Mrs Lucille Millslagle)
Vinegar, Sugar, Bottle lemon soda, Garlic, Butter, Worcestershire Sauce, Salt, Crushed red pepper to taste, Bottle catsup, 
Bring to a boil and simmer until thick, about 30 to 45 minutes. Keeps well  in the refrigerator. From "Whats Cookin In Sheffield" compiled by Womens  Missionary Society of Wesleyan Methodist Church, Sheffield, Illinois dated  1956.    I add a little black pepper for balance, not a bad basic sauce.    Posted to bbq-digest by mike moberley <lonechimney@earthlink.net> on Mar  22, 1998
