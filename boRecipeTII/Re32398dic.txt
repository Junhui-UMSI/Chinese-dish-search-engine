Barley-Shiitake Mushroom Soup
Quaker Quick Barley, Dry shiitake mushrooms, Yellow onions, Seasoning, Stalks celery, Salt or to taste, Water, Carrots, 
Rinse the shiitake mushrooms and set them aside to soak in plenty of water.  They will need about an hour to soak.  Chop the onions, celery, and  carrots. Put the vegetables and Michelles seasoning in a large stock pot  with the water. When the mushrooms are soft, snip them into smaller pieces  (approx. a square inch each) and drop them in the pot. Bring the pot to a  boil, turn down to simmer. Cook until the carrots just start to soften. Add  barley and simmer for another 10-15 minutes. Taste the broth occasionally  while cooking, add salt to taste and more of Michelles seasoning if  needed.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/fatfreex.zip
