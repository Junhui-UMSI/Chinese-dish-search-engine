Celery Root Gratin With saffron And Gruyere Cheese
Celery root, Russet potatoes, Heavy cream, butter, Saffron, Garlic, Gruyere, salt and pepper, , 
From the Dean & DeLuca Cookbook by David Rosengarten    1. Preheat oven to 400@    2. Place the celery root and the potatoes in separate large saucepans with  enough salted water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until soft. Strain  both the celery and the potatoes and set aside.    3. In a heavy saucepan bring the cream to a boil over moderately high heat,  and add the butter, saffron and garlic. Reduce the heat to moderately low,  and cook about 5 minutes, or until the cream mixture is bright yellow.    4. Puree the celery root in a food processor, gradually adding the cream  mixture. Set aside. Place the potatoes in a bowl and mash until you have a  rough texture. Add the celery root mixture to the potatoes, and add 1 cup  of the Gruyere. Mix together with a wooden spoon and season generously with  salt and pepper.    5. Butter a 13 x 9" ovenproof dish (about 10-cup capacity). If you prefer  to serve individual portions, you could use instead eight #4-size ramekins  (each one has a 1 1/4 cup capacity). Place the celery root-potato mixture  in the large, ovenproof dish or in the individual ramekins.    6. Sprinkle the top with the parsley and the remaining Gruyere. Bake in  oven for about 15 minutes, or until the casserole is heated through and the  top is golden brown.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by lynnthomas@juno.com (L. Thomas) on Aug 30,  1998,
