Traditional Cherry Pie
Granulated sugar, Almond extract, Pastry For 2-Crust, Unsweetened Tart, Butter or margarine, Quick-Cooking Tapioca, 
*note- you may substitute 4 cups of frozen unsweetened tart cherries If  using canned cherries, drain them well. Discard the juice or save for  another use. If using frozen cherries, it is not necessary to thaw them.  Combine well drained canned cherries or frozen cherries, granulated sugar,  tapioca and almond extract in a large mixing bow; mix well. Let stand 15  minutes. Line a 9 inch pie plate with pastry; fill with cherry mixture. Dot  with butter. Adjust top crust, cutting slits for steam to escape, or cut  top crust into strips and make a lattice-top pie. Bake in a preheated  400-degree oven 50 to 55 minutes, or until crust is golden brown and  filling is bubbly. George Washingtons favorite dessert!
