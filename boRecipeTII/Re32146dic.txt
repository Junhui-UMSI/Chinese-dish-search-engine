Cut octopus into strips or leave whole if small enough. Wash well and place  in a glass bowl.  Add oil, lemon juice, herbs and garlic. Cover and place  in refrigerator for 24 hours stirring occasionally. Cut capsicums into four  lengthways, remove seeds and white membrane. Brush outer skin with oil and  place skin down on hot barbecue until skins are well blistered, rub skins  off with a towel.  Arrange on plates, alternating colours. Drizzle with  half of the dressing and set aside. Heat barbecue to medium heat. Place  Octopus on the barbecue plate and cook for 15-20 minutes, turning  frequently and splashing on a little marinade as they cook. Remove and pile  into the centre of the pepper salad. Pour over remaining dressing and serve  with fresh garden salad.    found on rec.food.recipes Stephanie da Silva (arielle@taronga.com),  moderator
