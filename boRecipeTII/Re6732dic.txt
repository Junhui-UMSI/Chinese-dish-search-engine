1. Rinse the dried mushrooms. Place each variety of dried mushrooms in 2  cups of cold water and soak for at least 4 hours or overnight.    2. In a large pot, bring the stock to a simmer. Add the celery, onions, and  carrots. Strain the dried mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid. Add the  strained soaking liquid to the soup. Chop the hydrated mushrooms into  1/4-inch pieces slightly larger than the diced vegetables and add to the  soup. Add the sliced white button mushrooms.    3. Cover and cook the soup until the vegetables are tender, about 60  minutes. Bring the soup to a boil. Stirring constantly, add the orzo.  Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and, stirring occasionally to prevent the  pasta from sticking, cook until the orzo is cooked through, another 6 to 8  minutes.    4. Meanwhile melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the  flour and cook, stirring constantly until smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove 1  cup of the broth from the soup and add to the roux, whisking constantly  until slightly thickened and free of lumps. Stir the thickened liquid into  the soup. Add the chopped parsley and dill.    5. Finish the soup with sour cream: Add 1/4 cup of the thickened soup to  the sour cream. Whisk until smooth. Add the sour cream to the soup,  whisking constantly until it is well incorporated, about 3 minutes. Season  to taste with salt and pepper.
