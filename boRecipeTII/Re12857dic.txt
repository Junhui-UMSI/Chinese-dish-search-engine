Zabaglione (Wine-Flavored Custard)
Egg yolks, Sugar, Medium white wine, 
Beat egg yolks with electric mixer in top of double boiler until foamy.  Beat in sugar gradually.   Pour just enough hot water in bottom of double boiler so that top part does  not touch water. (Water in double boiler should not boil.) Cook egg yolks  over medium heat; mix in wine slowly, beating on high speed until smooth,  pale and thick enough to stand in soft mounds. Serve immediately in shallow  stemmed glasses.
