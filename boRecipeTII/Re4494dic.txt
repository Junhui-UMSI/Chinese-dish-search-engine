Season  to taste with salt and pepper. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1  week.    Note: Omit the Parmesan cheese and pine nuts if you plan to freeze the  pesto before using. Add the cheese and nuts after the pesto has thawed and  use immediately for up to 1 week. Variations: For a lower fat version,  reduce oil to 2 tablespoons, and add 3 tablespoons chicken broth and 2  tablespoons part-skim ricotta cheese.    Pesto with vegetables: Cut 2 medium red potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes. Steam  potatoes and 4 ounces tender green beans until crisp-tender, 6-8 minutes.  Toss with hot pasta and pesto.
