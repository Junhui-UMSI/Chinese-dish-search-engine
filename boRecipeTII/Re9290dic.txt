I love Puerto Rican Food!... Its usually simple, yet rich with lots of  cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can be  simplified to taste.  I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and garlic  with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).    I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).    In a large heavy kettle, brown meat in oil.    Add green pepper, sweet chili, onions, cloves, cilantro,  vinegar (or lime  juice), oregano, tomato sauce, bay leaves, and salt. Mix and bring to a  boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 1 hour.    Add carrots to kettle.  Drain liquid from peas into kettle and mix (reserve  peas)   Bring rapidly to a boil, reduce to low, cover and cook about 1 hr  until meat is almost fork-tender..    Add potatoes, olives, capers, raisins, and 1/2 tsp salt, bring rapidly to a  boil,  reduce heat to low, cover and cook about 1 hour, or until meat is  fork-tender and  vegetables are done.    Ad reserved peas and mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning (uncover, and boil to  thicken sauce to taste).
