Taralli (Italian Pretzels)
Salt, Yeast cake, Flour, Fennel seeds, Water; lukewarm, 
Dissolve the yeast in the water. Add enough of the flour to make a soft,  smooth dough, cover the bowl & leave in a warm place to rise, about 30  minutes. Sift the remaining flour & salt together & make a well in the  middle. Fill the well with the risen dough & mix well. Knead vigorously,  addding a little more water, if necessary, until the dough is smooth &  elastic. Roll into a ball, place in a large bowl & leave covered with a  damp cloth in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until the dough has  doubled.    Divide the dough into 24 pieces. Roll into small "sausages" about 1/2 inch  thick. Shape each sausage into a ring, closing the ends firmly together.  Arrange them on a floured baking sheet & leave to rise in a warm place for  about 2 hours.    Sprinkle the rings with fennel seeds & bake in a moderate oven (375 F) for  about 1 hour. They must be crisp.
