Drain the tomatoes, reserving the juice. In a heavy nonreactive soup pot or  saucepan, saute the onions and chile or cayenne in the oil for about 5  minutes, until the onions begin to soften. Add the cumin and lima beans and  saute, stirring, for a couple of minutes. Add the juice from the tomatoes,  cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Chop the whole tomatoes right in the can.  Stir the chopped tomatoes and corn into the pan. Cover and simmer until the  vegetables are tender (recipe said this should only take about 10 minutes,  but it took a lot longer. I dont know if it was because I was using fresh  instead of frozen lima beans but it took more like 30 or 40 minutes). Stir  in cilantro and add salt and black pepper to taste. Serve plain or topped  with suggested garnishes. Serve over rice, polenta, or quinoa, or with warm  tortillas or cornbread.    Recipe is from _Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home_ and was modified just  slightly by me.
