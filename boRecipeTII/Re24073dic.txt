COMMENTS:Bake in miniature size and use as an hors doeuvre, suggests the  owner of this recipe, who uses muffin pans for his favorite dish for a  December family reunion. To accompany the mini-tourtieres, he likes  home-made tomato-and-peach ketchup and dry red wine. TIP: Add a pinch or  two more herbes and spices. Heat oil in a large, heavy frying pan and  saut=82 ground pork, veal and beef, breaking up meat until crumbly. Add  garlic and onions, and saut=82 until vegetables are soft. Add beef broth,  sage, ba= y leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, parsley flakes, dry celery  leaves and celery seeds. Cover and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Add brandy  and breadcrumbs. Blend in salt and pepper. Simmer briefly. Mixture should  be moist. Cool. Preheat oven to 425F.. Line 3 9-inch pie pans with pastry,  reserving an equal amount of the dough for top crusts. Fill each pan with  meat mixture. Cover with pastry, cutting two slits in the center of each  pie to permit steam to escape. Brush each pie with beaten egg. Bake  tourtieres for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350F. and cook until crust=    is golden-brown, about 25 minutes. Serve hot or cool completely, wrap and  freeze. Makes 3 tourtieres. From the MOTREAL GAZETTE, DECEMBER 5 1984.
