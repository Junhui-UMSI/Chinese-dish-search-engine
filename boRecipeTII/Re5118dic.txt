1. Preheat oven to 375?    2. In a large mixing bowl lightly beat the egg yolks, lemon juice, and  rind.    3. Into a saucepan shift together 1 1/2 cups of the sugar, the cornstarch,  flour, and salt. Set the pan over very low heat and gradually add the  boiling water stirring constantly until the mixture thickens.    4. Stir the flour, cornstarch, and water mixture into the egg mixture a  little at a time.    5. Pour back into pan the saucepan, and cook again over medium to high heat  until mixture thickens to a point that the bottom of the pan is visible  when a wooden spoon is pulled across the bottom.    6. Remove from heat, blend in the butter. Let the filling cool until luke  warm.    7. Spread filling into a 10 inch graham cracker or 10 inch baked pie shell.    8. In a mixing bowl beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, add the  remaining 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup at a time, continuing to beat until stiff  peaks form.    9. Spread meringue over top of pie insuring it touches the edge of the  crust all the way around the pie.    10. Set the pan in the oven and cook 25 minutes or until the meringue is  delicately browned.    11. Let pie cool before serving.    HINT: After meringue is spread on pie, take a spatula and lay it on the  meringue and lift it straight up. Do this all over the pie to form  decorative peaks. If you sprinkle it with sugar the cooked pie will have  pretty little brown droplets formed by the melted sugar. If you use  confectioners sugar add 2 Tsp vanilla    NOTES :         If you like the tangy taste of lemon youll love this pie.  Posted to MasterCook Digest V1 #339 by "Max H.
