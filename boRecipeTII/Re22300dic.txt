This is and the following recipes will be from Eva Exner, Braten und  Schmoren im Roemertopf, ISBN 3-87059-080-7    Wash and remove outer leaves of broussel sprouts, quarter tomatoes and chop  the onions. Put into watered claypot and add the mushrooms. Sprinkle soup  seasoning onto it and put turkey on top. Mix pepper, paprika, salt and  squeezed garlic with oil and paint turkey with the mixture. Cut bacon into  thin stripes and cover the turkey with them. Close claypot and cook the  turkey for about 150 minutes at 220 degree C (428 F). Remove turkey from  cleypot and keep warm. Use the package gravy sauce and the water from the  mushrooms and make a gravy. Add the vegetables from the claypot and boil  quickly.    Serve turkey and sauce with potato dumplings.    (*) yes, the recipe calls for tinned mushrooms, which I only realized when  they spoke of the mushroom water    (**) soup seasoning is just a mix of glutamat, much salt and some spices, a  still :-( much used enhancer of soups    (***) gravy sauce is used either for thickening of self-made sauces or on  its own when one does not have any fond. It is basically a dark roux with  also mostly too much salt and some spices.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 28 Jun 97 by Carmen Bartels  <caba@SQUIRREL.HAN.DE> on Jun 29, 1997
