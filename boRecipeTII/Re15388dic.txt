White Castle Hamburgers
Pickle slices, Salt to taste, Hot dog buns, Black Pepper, Onion, American cheese, Ground beef, 
1. Prepare the beef ahead of time by separating into sixteen 1-ounce  portions and flattening each on wax paper into very thin square patties  about 2-1/2 inches on a side. Using a small circular object like the tip of  a pen cap, make five small, evenly spaced holes in each patty. Freeze the  patties (still on waxed paper) completely and youre ready to cook.    2. If youre using hot dog buns, cut off the ends and then cut each bun in  half to make 2 buns from each. If youre using hamburger buns, cut each  down to about a 2-1/2-inch square.    3. Slice the onion into match-size pieces.    4. Grill the faces of the buns in a large pan over medium heat.    5. In the hot pan, spread out tablespoon-size piles of onions 3 inches  apart. Salt and pepper each pile of onions.    6. On each pile of onions place a frozen beef patty. You may have to spread  the onions out some so that the hamburger lies flat. Salt each patty as it  cooks.    7. Cook each burger for 4 to 5 minutes on the onions. If you made the  burgers thin enough, the holes will ensure that each patty is cooked  thoroughly without flipping them over.    8. Assemble by sandwiching the patty and onions between each grilled bun.  Makes 16 burgers. Notes: If you want to add pickle slices to your burger,  as they do at White Castle, stack them on top of the grilled onions. For a  cheeseburger, youll have to cut a slice of American cheese to the same  size as your burger, and then it goes on top of the onions, under the  pickles, if you use pickles.
