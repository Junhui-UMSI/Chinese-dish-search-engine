When you buy corned beef, ask for the "first cut," which is the  leanest part. If you prefer your meat more piquant, add a few chilies  to the pot. Let the corned beef rest about 15 minutes after baking,  for smoother, easier slicing.    1. Place corned beef in a large, heavy pot; cover with water.    2. Stud the onion with cloves. Add to pot along with the peppercorns,  garlic and chilies.    3. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low,  partially covered and simmer for 2 1/2 hours or until meat is tender.  Preheat oven to 350F.    4. Remove beef to a small, shallow baking dish. Set aside 3/4 cup  cooking liquid. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper, then spread  marmalade over top. Pour reserved cooking liquid into pan. Bake 25  minutes, basting occasionally.    Per serving: 476 calories, 31 grams fat, 157 milligrams cholesterol.
