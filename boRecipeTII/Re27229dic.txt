If ladyfingers are soft, toast them in a 350 degree F oven for 6 to 8  minutes.    In a small bowl, stir together 3 T of the brandy, coffee granules and 1 cup  water.  Brush over the flat side of the ladyfingers. Set aside.    Bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer in the bottom of a large saucepan.  Combine egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and 3 T cold water in a  heatproof mixing bowl that will fit over the saucepan. Set the bowl over  the simmering water and beat with a hand-held mixer at low speed until an  instant-read or candy thermometer registers 140 degrees F, 4 to 5 minutes.  Increase speed to high and continue beating over heat for 3 minutes (The  mixture should form a ribbon trail.) Remove the bowl from the heat and beat  until cool and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Set aside.    In a large bowl, beat mascarpone and cream cheese until creamy. Add about 1  cup of the beaten whites and the remaining 1 T brandy and beat until  smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Fold in the remaining whites.    Line the bottom and sides of a 3 quart trifle bowl or souffle dish with  ladyfingers.  Spoon in one-quarter of the filling and tip with a layer of  ladyfingers. Repeat with two more layers of filling and ladyfinters,  arranging the fourth layer of ladyfingers decoratively over the top,  trimming to fit, if necessary. Top with the remaining filling. Garnish with  chocolate shavings.  Cover and chill for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Dust with confectioners sugar and serve.
