Flesch" <mflesch@mail.coin.missouri.edu>  Eve Fleck requested a recipe for vegetable stock; heres one I got from the  Canyon Ranch cookbook. I usually throw in whatevers in the fridge as well:    Combine all ingredients in large pot and bring to boil. Reduce heat and  simmer uncovered for 1 hour.  Line strainer or colander with cheesecloth  and set over a large bowl. Strain stock; cool. Refrigerate or freeze. Makes       16    cups.
