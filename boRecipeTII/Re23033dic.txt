Trout with Cream and Honey Sauce
Flour, Whole almonds, Honey, Lemon juice, Milk, Trout, heavy cream, Butter, 
Chop the almonds finely.  Prepare the fish, wash and dry and then soak  in milk for 5-10 minutes.  Toss in seasoned four.  Melt half the butter  in the frying pan, and fry the fish for 5-7 minutes on each side. Make  the sauce by melting the rest of the butter, adding the chopped almonds.  Saute for a few minutes.  Then add the honey and lemon juice; bring  carefully to simmering point, and add the cream last, making sure the  temperature is fairly low so it wont curdle.  Pour over the fried fish,  and serve garnished with lemon.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mm-trout.zip
