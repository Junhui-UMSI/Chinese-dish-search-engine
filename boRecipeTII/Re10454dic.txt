Quick Creole Sauce
Onions, Tomato sauce, Garlic, Margarine, Parsley, Bay leaves, Thyme, Green peppers, olives, Pepper, milk, 
* Original recipe called for one 10-ounce can of tomato soup; I prefer  tomato sauce, but use soup if you wish, or try a mixture of the two. The  flavored tomato sauces are excellent.    Saute green pepper, onion, olives and garlic in margarine for 5 minutes (or  mix olive oil for half the margarine). Add remaining ingredients; mix well.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
