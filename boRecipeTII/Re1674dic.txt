Carrots with Hijiki (Or Arame)
Dried hijiki; or arame, Carrots; julienned, Soy sauce; to taste, Fresh ginger root; slivered, Toasted sesame seeds, Dark sesame oil; *, 
* Original called for 2 tablespoons for sauteing. However, by adding just a  teaspoon or so later in cooking, the dish will still have a sesame flavor.    Soak the hijiki in water for 15 minutes. Drain, and put in a saucepan with  2 tbsp soy sauce and fresh water, and boil for, then simmer for 15 minutes.  Drain again.    (If using Arame, soak for 3 minutes, then drain.)    Stir fry the ginger and carrots until the carrots begin to color around the  edges, about 2 minutes. Add the seaweed and cook for 5 more minutes,  tossing frequently. Add 1 tbsp soy sauce and let it cook off. Add the  sesame oil, if desired.    Garnish with toasted sesame seeds.    >From Ellen C. <ellen@elekta.com>    Per serving: 197 Calories; 6g Fat (25% calories from fat); 8g Protein; 33g  Carbohydrate; 0mg Cholesterol; 2102mg Sodium Food Exchanges: 6 1/2  Vegetable; 1 Fat    Recipe by: Vegetarian Cooking For Everyone, Deborah Madison    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Ellen C." <ellen@elekta.com> on Sep 14, 1998,
