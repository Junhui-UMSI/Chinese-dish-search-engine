Combine 1/2 cup of the olive oil with the garlic, coriander seeds and  1 cup of the minced basil in a medium-size, non-reactive bowl. Add the  prawns, cover and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or in the  refrigerator overnight.    To grill the prawns: Prepare a medium-hot fire (a light layer of gray  ash should cover the charcoal), place the prawns on the grill and  cook, basting with the marinade and rotating the prawns to cook  evenly, for 4-5 minutes or just until they are opaque to the center.  Remove from the grill.    To bake the prawns: Place prawns in a single layer, with marinade, in  a baking dish in a preheated 450F. oven. Cook for 5-7 minutes or  just until the prawns are opaque to the center. Remove prawns from  baking pan with a slotted spoon.    Arrange the arugula and the remaining basil on a large platter. Top  with the warm prawns, roasted peppers and feta cheese. Drizzle with  the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and sprinkle with freshly ground  pepper.
