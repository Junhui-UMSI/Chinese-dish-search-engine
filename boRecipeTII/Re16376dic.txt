This is a recipe I got at a science fiction convention where they were  serving it.    Boil water, add the tea and steep 5 minutes.  While steeping, mix the  juices, allspice, and honey.  Strain tea, add to juices with sliced fruit  and cloves. Like most punches, you can adjust for your taste ;-).    MARCIA@NETCOM.COM    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
