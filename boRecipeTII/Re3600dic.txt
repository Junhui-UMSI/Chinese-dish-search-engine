Pecan-Crusted Pork Tenderloin
saffron rice, Black peppercorns, Pork tenderloin, Dijon mustard, pecans, Fresh thyme, Nonfat yogurt, asparagus, 
1) Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Preheat grill pan or oven-proof skillet to  medium high heat.  2) Add yogurt cheese, mustard, thyme and black pepper to a small bowl. Mix  to combine well.  3) Set out three sheets of wax paper. Spoon the yogurt mixture onto the  first and the pecans on the second. Roll each tenderloin medallion in the  yogurt, leaving the cut ends clean. Then roll each medallion in the chopped  pecans, again leaving the cut ends clean. Set each medallion, end up, on  the third sheet of wax paper and set aside.  4) When the water for the rice begins to boil, place the medallions on the  grill or skillet, ends down. If using a grill pan, cook for 2 1/2 minutes  and then give each medallion a 90-degree turn to cook for 2 1/2 minutes  more. Turn the medallions and cook the other end for 5 minutes. If using a  skillet, cook each medallion for 4 minutes per side. Place skillet or grill  pan in the oven and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until just done. The pork  should have a slight blush in the center for maximum flavor and tenderness.  Serve with saffron rice and cooked asparagus.  Posted to MasterCook Digest V1 #190    Recipe by: E.
