Info:  from "Real Thai" by Nancy McDermott posted by Perry Lowell    Yum kai kem is a simple, country-style accompaniment to rice, and is often  served with green curries as a sharp, salty complement to their rich, fiery  heat.    Peel the eggs, halve them lengthwise, and arrange them on serving dish.  Sprinkle the chili slices and shallots over the eggs. Drizzle with lime  juice and serve.
