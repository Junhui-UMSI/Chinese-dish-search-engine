Lumpia is a traditional Filipino appetizer, not unlike eggrolls. Recipe  from Chef Andy Pforzheimer <apforz@pfood.win.net>:    Saute garlic in oil until light brown. Add chicken and onion. Season with  fish sauce. Remove from pan. Repeat the process with the shrimp, but  stir-frying quickly and remove from pan immediately. Return the  chicken-onion mixture to the pan, add in sequences, green bean, garbanzos,  carrot, rutabagas, yam, cabbage, bean curd. Add a little stock and allow to  simmer until the desired tenderness. Season with salt, fish sauce to your  taste. Add the Chinese parsley last, just before removing from the pan.    To assemble the lumpia, you will need:    Lumpia wrapper - commercially available Romaine or green or red or butter  lettuce    Lumpia Sauce:    Bring the water to a boil. Add the sugar to the boiling water and stir  until dissolved. Remove 1/4 cup of the syrup, add the cornstarch, blend  into a slurry and return to the pot. Remove from heat when thickened. Mix  in garlic.    NOTE: lumpia; lumpia wrapper [LOOM-pee-ah] This Philippine version of the  EGG ROLL consists of a lumpia wrapper (a thin "skin" made of flour or  cornstarch, eggs and water) wrapped around a filling and fried. Sometimes a  lettuce leaf is used to enfold the filling mixture, in which case lumpia is  not fried. The filling can be made of chopped raw or cooked vegetables,  meat or a combination of the two. Lumpia can be served as an appetizer or  side dish.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by J Pellegrino <gigimfg@ix.netcom.com> on Sep  13, 1998,
