When hot, add potatoes and salt (and optional cajun seasoning  or curry powder) to taste. Cook, turning infrequently so potatoes brown,  till about 1/2 done. Add onions and peppers, and continue to cook till  done. Season with pepper, and optional herbs, green onions, and roasted  pepper (the seasonings truly are optional - its good with just salt and  pepper).    Eat as-is, or top with fresh salsa, or thickened nonfat yogurt.  Good  served with scambled Better-n-Eggs (the best liquid egg sub. in my opinion)  or scrambled tofu.
