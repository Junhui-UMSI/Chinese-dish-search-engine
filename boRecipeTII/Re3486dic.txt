Makes 10 burgers, 5 servings    from Bharti Kirchners "Vegetarian Burgers"    Heat oil in skillet; cook garlic until golden. Add onions, mushrooms,  chard, tamari and rice vinegar. Cook, covered, until vegetables are  softened. Place vegetable mixture and the bulgar in food processor or  blender; pulse several times until well blended. Scrape into large bowl and  add ground pecans and bread crumbs. Mis with spoon or hands until all  ingredients are thoroughly combined. Form into pattied 1/2 inch thick and 3  inches diameter. Preheat broiler. Place patties on cookie sheet and broil  3-5 inches from heat, 7 to 9 minutes per side or until lightly browned.  When one side is done, turn patties carefully with spatula. Serving  suggestions: on whole wheat bun, or focaccia bread, with shredded lettuce  or cabbage, sweet onion rings, or a gravy. (My note: we ate once as a  burger-on-a-bun, another as a cutlet entree with light vegetable gravy. I  can attest that they are also delicious cold right out of the  refrigerator!)
