Divide dough into 6 pieces.  On floured surface, with floured rolling  pin, roll each piece of dough into 7 inch round. Top left half of each  round with cheese mixture, dividing evenly. Moisten edges with water; fold  right side of dough over so edges meet. Press edges to seal; crimp. Place  on large baking sheet; with scissors, make three 1/2 inch slits in top of  each.    3.
