Stan Frankenthaler, is a chef at Caffe Gianni, in downtown Boston. This  dish is equally good hot or at room temperature.    Set the oven at 425 degrees.  In a large bowl, toss the butternut squash  with the olive oil and salt and pepper. Place the mixture in a large heavy  duty baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 20 minutes or  until soft but still holding its shape.    While the squash is baking, place the red wine vinegar, hone and garlic in  a small sauce pan.  In a grinder or using a mortal and pestle, grind the  chilies, coriander seed and fennel seed together and add to the saucepan.   Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to 1/2 cup. Taste to make sure the  glaze is a little more tangy then sweet and adjust seasonings if necessary.    When the squash is cooked, remove from the oven and place in a decorative  bowl.  Toss with the glaze, adjusting the salt and pepper if needed.    Source:  THE BOSTON GLOBE; November, 1993
