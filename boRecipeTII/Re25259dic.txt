olive oil, Serrano chiles, Garlic, Pasta, Onion, 
1. Pour olive oil in a fry pan and heat    2. Meantime:    thinly slice a big onion mince up a few fresh serranos crush a few cloves  of garlic    3. When the oil is hot add all above to it and cook till the onion is  clear. (Do not let the garlic get too brown.)    4. Pour all the above on some cooked pasta.    5. Toss. Salt and pepper to taste.    6. Eat    If you have some leftover veggies in the fridge - broccoli, string beans,  whatever, (even a small can of peas and/or garbanzo beans or kidney beans)  ~ add them to the frying pan just long enough to heat through.    Grated Cheese can be added just before serving and just before salting.  The product gives a warm glow to ones cheeks and stomach. Its lovely on a  cold, rainy evening, or for lunch on a hot day.
