Penne with Shrimp and Bacon
Frozen peas; thawed, Salt and pepper, Butter; (1 used less), Penne rigate pasta, Medium shrimp; peeled/trimed, Ricotta cheese; * see below, Parmesan cheese; grated**, Puond bacon; cut in narrow, 
I cut this recipe in half to serve two. We each had a very large helping  and there was a generous serving leftover.    * I did not have ricotta cheese and didnt want to buy it for the 1/4 cup I  would use here, so I used 1 slice of provolone cheese, minced and enough  fatfree sour cream to equal the 1/4 cup ricotta cheese.    ** I used fat-free Parmesan cheese    Cook Penne in boiling salted water. In a large fryping pan, heat bacon  until fat begins to melt. Stir in thawed peas and saute for 1-2 minutes  before adding the shrimp. Cook until just done. Remove from heat and stir  in 1-2 Tbsp. butter until melted. In a bowl, combine ricotta, salt, pepper  and Parmesan. Just before serving add 2 Tbsp. boiling pasta water and whisk  thoroughly.    Drain penne when al dente and mix in ricotta. Add bacon-shrimp mixture and  toss well before serving.
