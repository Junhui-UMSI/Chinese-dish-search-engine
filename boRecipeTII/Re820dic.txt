Herb or Spice Flavored Oils-Warm Infused Method
Finely chopped fresh, OR, Ground cumin, cinnamon, OR, Chopped fresh ginger, olive oil, 
Put herbs or spices and oil in a heavy saucepan. Heat over high heat until  the mixture begins to sizzle gently. Let cook, for about 10 seconds, remove  pan from heat, and swirl contents until sizzling stops. Pour through a fine  strainer or coffee filters into a sterilized jar or bottle. Press down on  herbs to release the last bit of oil and flavor. Seal tightly, refrigerate,  and use within 1 week for best flavor.    Note: Use this method for tough-leafed herbs such as rosemary and sage as  well as dried spices. Use the amounts of flavoring ingredients as a guide,  feeling free to add more or less depending on the quality of your  ingredients and your taste preferences. Dried spices extract very well and  make delicious oils. For the best flavor, grind your own spices from the  whole spice. The amount given will make a strongly flavored oil; dilute  with more olive oil if desired.
