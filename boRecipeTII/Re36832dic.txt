From: Suzan Herskowitz <zwriter@bcfreenet.seflin.lib.fl.us>    Date: Thu, 8 Aug 1996 11:58:06 -0400 (EDT)  (this can be made with any fruit including mango)    Someone (sorry I forget who) recently asked about mangos and what to do  with them. Browsing through todays food section of the paper, I saw  something that may be interesting. Sounds cool and refreshing. I am going  to try the "Morir Y Sonandor".    These were culled from the Fort Lauderdale _Sun-Sentinel_ on August 8,  1996, although the article was written by Elaine Louie at the New York  Times. Some background (without reproducing the entire article. These are  basically my words): Columbians call these _batidos_, which translates  loosely as "shakes." Mexicans call them _preparados_ or _licuados_. What  they are are fruit drinks blended with sugar, milk or water and whipped  until smooth and foamy.    Found throughout Central and South America and Southeast Asia, a _batido_  can be made with any fruit (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries,  mangos, papayas, bananas, tamarind, passion fruit (also known as _maracuya_  or _granadilla_.) Pineapples can also be used.    So while not Jewish Food specifically, I can imagine that Mexican and  Central and South American Jews will sip these cool summer treats.    Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth.
