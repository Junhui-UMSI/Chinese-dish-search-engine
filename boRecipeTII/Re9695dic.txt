Ogden writes:  "...  this recipe makes a light fluffy pie that shows off  the flavor of our Small Sugar pumpkins. " *This recipe should work with  other pumpkins, however.    Slice pumpkin in half and place halves face down on a pie sheet in a 350 F  oven.  Bake 1 hour, or until knife penetrates skin easily. Remove from  oven, scoop out seeds and scrape pumpkin pulp from skin - yield two cups.  In a food processor, blend until smooth with the remaining ingredients,  using the steel blade. Pour into pie crust and bake at 375 F for 40  minutes.    Recipe developed by Ellen Ogden.  In "The Cooks Garden" catalog, Vol. 9,  No. 1. Spring 1992. Pg. 47. Typed for you by Cathy Harned.
