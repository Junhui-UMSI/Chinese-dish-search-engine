Whenever cold soups call for chicken broth, be sure to defat it  completely for best results. Also, black pepper is the only spice in  this chowder, so freshly ground is a MUST.    1. Place broth, corn cobs and dill sprigs in a heavy pot. Bring to a  boil, reduce heat, simmer 10 minutes. Discard cobs and dill.    2. Add potatoes to broth and cook for 8 minutes or until tender. Add  corn kernels and cook 1 minute longer. Remove from heat; pour soup  through a strainer, reserving vegetables and broth.    3. Place yogurt and 2/3 of the diced cucumbers in the bowl of a food  processor; pulse on and off just to combine ingredients (so some  texture remains). With motor on, pour in 1 cup of reserved broth  through feed tube and pulse machine on to just combine ingredients.  Remove to a bowl. Save any leftover broth for another use.    4. Stir in the reserved vegetables, remaining diced cucumber, bell  pepper and chopped dill. Season with fresh black pepper. Refrigerate  for up to 2 hours. Serve chilled.

Then divide corn between  bowls and ladle soup on top.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
