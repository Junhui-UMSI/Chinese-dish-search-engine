Preheat oven to 350 deg. F and butter a 9-inch springform pan. Make base:  In a small saucepan melt butter and stir in cocoa powder. Remove pan from  heat and add brown sugar, stirring until dissolved. Stir in flour, walnuts,  egg, and vanilla and spread batter evenly in springform pan. Bake base in  middle of oven 10 minutes, or just until firm, and transfer to a rack to  cool. Make filling: Arrange walnuts in one layer on top of base. In a small  heavy saucepan combine butter, brown sugar, and honey and cook over  moderate heat, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until a candy  thermometer registers 280 deg. F. Remove pan from heat and add cream,  vanilla, and lemon juice, stirring until smooth. Cool mixture to room  temperature and pour over walnuts, spreading evenly. Make ganache: In a  saucepan bring cream just to a boil. Finely chop chocolate. Put chocolate  in a metal bowl and pour hot cream over it, stirring until smooth. Cool  ganache to room temperature and beat with an electric mixer until it just  holds soft peaks (do not overbeat or it will become grainy). Spread ganache  evenly over filling. Chill cake, covered, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.  Run a thin knife around edge of cake and remove side of pan. With a large  spatula transfer cake to a plate and let stand at room temperature 30  minutes before serving.    Makes one 9-inch cake.    At the cafe this dessert is accompanied by raspberry sauce and topped with  whipped cream.
