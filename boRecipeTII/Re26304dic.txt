Add the tomatoes, stock, sugar and salt  and pepper. Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally, then lower the heat  and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Puree in an electric blender and  then sieve (strain), or press mixture through a sieve (strainer). Return  the soup to the rinsed-out pan and bring to the boil again. Add the  vermicelli and cook for 6 to 10 minutes until pasta is tender yet firm to  the bite. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately with freshly made  croutons.
