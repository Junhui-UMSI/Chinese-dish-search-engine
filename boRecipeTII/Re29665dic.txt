Here are a few recipes that use ground beef.  I got most of them from a  cookbook called "country Ground Beef".  To order the cookbook, specify code  11608 and send $9.98 each plus 2.50 S & H to:  Country Store, Suite 3227,  5925 Country Lane, P.O. Box 990, Greendale, WI  53129.   This cookbook has  around 300 recipes with ground beef and they are wonderful. Cook onion,  celery and beef; drain.  Stir in salt and pepper.  Spoon into a greased  12x8" dish.  Mix in soup.  Top with frozen potatoes.  Bake @ 400 about 40  min. or until bubbly.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with cheese. Return to  oven and bake until cheese melts, about 5 mins.
