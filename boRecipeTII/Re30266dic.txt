1.  In med bowl, beat together first six (wet) ingredients.    2.  In large bowl, stir together remaining ingredients.  Add banana mixture  and stir to moisten.    3.  Spoon into 12 greased muffin cups and bake at 425F for 14 mins until  tester comes clean.    My notes:  I left out nuts.  Make sure bananas are very ripe and large! If  in doubt use three, it cant hurt. Truly great for breakfast and a good  source of fibre.
