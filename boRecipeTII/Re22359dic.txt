Turkish Delight
water, granulated sugar, unflavoured powdered ?, Zest of 1 orange, Zest of 1 lemon, cornstarch, 
Dissolve the granulated sugar in half of the water over medium heat. Add  the strips of lemon and orange peel and the juices. Bring the mixture to a  boil and simmer for 15 minutes. Soften the gelatin by soaking it for 5 to  10 minutes in the rest of the water. Add the gelatin to the sugar syrup  stirring well, and boil for 10 minutes, until the syrup reaches the thread  stage.    Strain the mixture into shallow dampened pan or onto platters, and let it  set for 24 hours. Cut the candy into 1-inch (2 1/2 cm) squares. Sift the  confectioners sugar and cornstarch together into a shallow dish. Roll the  pieces of candy in the mixture. Store the squares in boxes with more  confectioners sugar and cornstarch between each layer. Posted to EAT-L  Digest  by "Storm, Paula" <PAULAS@NCMS.ORG> on Dec 17, 1997
