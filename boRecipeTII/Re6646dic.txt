Polenta
Salt, Parmesan cheese, Butter, Yellow corn meal (polenta), Water, 
Bring salted water to boil; add polenta, stirring constantly with a wooden  spoon.  Add butter and cheese; cook over low heat, stirring continuously  for 25 minutes. Polenta can be served with Italian sauce, or rinse a  shallow baking dish with cold water, pour in polenta mixture, spreading so  it is 1/2 inch thick. Cover; cut into 2 inch squares; saute in 1/4 cup  butter over moderate heat, turning 3 or 4 times until lightly browned and  serve as a starch with any kind of meat.
