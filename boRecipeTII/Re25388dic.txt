Tortilla Bake
Cooked diced chicken, Corn tortillas; cut into, Onion, Cheddar cheese, (19 oz.) red kidney beans, Jar; (14 oz.) prepared salsa, olive oil, 
Heat oil in saucepan. Add onion and cook until softened. Add beans and  salsa. Cook, stirring occasionally for 15 minutes. Add cooked chicken and  cook for 5 minutes. Spread 1/3 of bean mixture in baking dish. Cover w/half  tortilla strips. Repeat layers and top w/remaining bean mixture. Sprinkle  cheese over bean mixture. Bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. (My note: I  didnt use the medium onion since the salsa had onions in it).    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Morris Hymes <mhymes@DC.INFI.NET> on Dec 9, 1997
