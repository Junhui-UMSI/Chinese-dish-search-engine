Set aside a wax paper-lined baking sheet.  Chop the  white chocolate into small pieces and set aside.  Toast the nuts on a  baking sheet in a single layer for 5 to 8 minutes. Set them aside.    In the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling water, melt the white  chocolate and the butter in the water.  Stir until smooth.    A NOTE on Melting White Chocolate: Since the fats in white chocolates melt  at different temperatures, and since the milk proteins tend to clump if  overheated, melting white chocolate can be very frustrating.  Ive found  that the easiest method is to chop the chocolate into small pieces and melt  them in the microwave. Microwave at high power for 1 minute, then stir. If  necessary, continue the process for additional 30-second intervals until  completely melted.  Microwave only until smooth; DO NOT OVERHEAT!!!    Pour into a bowl and add the yolk.  Continue beating until the mixture is  fluffy and cooled to room temperature.  Chill until firm (about 4 hours).  Remove from refrigerator and form into 24 1-inch balls.  Sandwich between 2  nut halves.  Chill until ready to serve.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
