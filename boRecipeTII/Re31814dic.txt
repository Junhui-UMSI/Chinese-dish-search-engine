During this time, prepare the sauce: mix  together the hoisin sauce, chili sauce, Shao Hsing, soy sauce, fish sauce,  chili paste, sesame oil, peanut oil, hot chili oil, sugar, and the MSG. In  a wok heat 4 cups of peanut oil to 375 degrees F. When the shrimp are ready  to cook thoroughly wash off salt with cold water. Add another teaspoon salt  to shrimp and let sit 30 seconds, and wash off the salt. Repeat this  procedure twice more. The final time drain well but do not dry, let some  water cling to the shrimp. Immerse half the shrimp into the hot oil, and  cook until just past translucent, about 20 seconds. Remove. Add the other  half of the shrimp. The oil will not be as hot, so this portion may need 30  seconds to finish cooking. Remove.    Drain all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the wok. Over very high heat, stir  fry the ginger, garlic, scallions and dried chilies for one minute. Add the  reserved shrimp and toss, add the sauce to coat shrimp and serve.    Note: Chili sauce is an American product available in any supermarket; it  was introduced to China early in this century and has become a part of  Chinese cuisine. Shao Hsing is rice wine, and is available in Chinese  liquor stores. Dry sherry is a good substitute.
