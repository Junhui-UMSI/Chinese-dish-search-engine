Egg yolks; beaten, Vanilla extract, Superfine sugar, Cream of tartar, Vanilla, Milk; scalded, Peanut butter, Egg whites; room temp, MERINGUE, Sugar, Flour; all-purpose, 9-inch pie shell; baked, Ground ginger, 
Prepare the prebaked pie shell; cool completely. In the top of a double  boiler set over simmering water, combine 1/2 cup of the hot milk with the  sugar and flour. Add 1 1/2 cups of hot milk to the mixture in the double  boiler and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes or until thickened.  Stir a small amount of the hot custard into the egg yolks. Combine the egg  yolk mixture with the mixture in the double boiler. Cook for 2 minutes  more. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the vanilla. Beat the peanut butter  with the remaining milk. Add the peanut butter mixture to the hot custard.  Turn the filling into the pie shell. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. While  the filling is still hot, prepare the meringue. Beat the egg whites,  vanilla, and cream of tartar until the mixture holds stiff peaks. Gradually  add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until very stiff and glossy.  All the sugar must be dissolved. Spread the meringue over the hot filling,  sealing it to the edge of the crust. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden  brown. Cool, and chill until serving.
