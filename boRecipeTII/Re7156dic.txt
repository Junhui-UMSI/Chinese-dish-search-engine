Porcini Oil
Water, Salt, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Dried porcini, 
~--In a small saucepan, combine the porcini and the water.  Cook over high  heat until all the water has evaporated. Reduce the heat to low, add the  olive oil, and heat until the oil reaches 250F; keep it at that temperature  for 10 minutes. ---Remove from the heat and let cool. Put the oil  (including the mushrooms) and the salt in a blender and blend to a coarse  puree.  Pour into a one-pint glass jar, let the oil come to room  temperature, and then seal the jar with a tight-fitting lid. Store the oil  in a cool dark place for several days before using. Refrigerated, the oil  will keep for up to 3 months.    Recipe By     : DDMmom    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
