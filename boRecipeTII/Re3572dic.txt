Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Juice one orange, and place rind and juice  in pan with whole yarns. Bake in a foil-covered baking dish for  approximately 1 hour. Mash the hot yams with a fork. If you prefer a  smoother texture, whip them with a hand mixer. Add juice and zest from  other orange, spices, vanilla, salt, maple syrup and dissolved kuzu. Set  aside. The Crust MAKES 2 9-INCH CRUSTS Combine flours and salt. Introduce  the oil into the flour in quick motions with the fingers--do not over-mix.  When oil is randomly distributed, sprinkle in the water until a ball can be  formed. Allow dough to sit for a few minutes, then roll out and place in  pie plate. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour yam filling into the unbaked  crust and even out the surface with a spatula. Make sure you leave enough  room for the pecan topping. Place pecans mosaic-fashion in pan on top of  filling. Combine barley malt and maple syrup and sprinkle over nuts so they  are shiny but not drenched. Bake the pie for 40 minutes, or until topping  is bubbling and carmelized, and the crust is brown at the edges. Pie must  cool before slicing.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 26 Jan 97 by "Ted D.
