This recipe was in Chile Pepper a few yrs. ago. Its good! I think I made  some changes in this version from the original.    Filling: Place ingredients in pan and cover with water and simmer for an  hour and a half or until the meat starts to fall apart. Remove the beef,  strain the broth, and save for the sauce. Allow the meat to cool and shred  the meat by using 2 forks or your fingers.    SAUCE: Combine flour and 3 Tbsp. oil to make a roux. Saute the mixture,  stirring constantly, for 3-4 minutes. Set aside. Saute the onions and  garlic in remaining oil. Stir in chiles, cumin, tomatoes, and broth. Bring  to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the roux and  simmer fir a few minutes to thicken. NOTE: I add 2 Tbsp. hot chili powder    THE ENCHILADAS: Fry tortillas briefly in hot oil to soften. Drain on paper  towels. To assemble: For each enchilada stack, place a little sauce on  bottom of casserole dish, place a tortilla on top, then the beef, some  cheese and onion, then some sauce. Repeat the procedure for 3 more layers  and finish with a tortilla. Pour the sauce over the top. Bake at 350 for 15  minutes. Serve with lettuce and chopped tomatoes. May be topped with a  fried egg if desired.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on Feb 17,  1998
