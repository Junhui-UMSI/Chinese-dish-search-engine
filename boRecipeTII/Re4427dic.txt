Pesole with Pork
Red chili powder, Water, Pork, Oregano, Dry pesole, Salt to taste, 
Pesole is a whole form of hominy and it can be found in any Latin  American or Mexican shop. Or, you can use regular hominy and will enjoy the  dish, I know. This is another basic food product of the Southwest. I  suspect that you will come to think of it as a staple in your pantry.      Soak the pesole in the water overnight. Then, place the pesole and water  in a 3-quart cooking kettle and add the remaining ingredients. Simmer,  covered, until the kernels burst, about 2 hours.      This is really a complete meal. But since most of us are not used to  thinking that way, I suggest you add some Cabbage and Salt Pork, along with  bread and a salad.
