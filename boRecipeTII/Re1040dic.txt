This is the easiest recipe for coffee cake ever. I make it for everything  and it always gets rave reviews. My mom gave me the recipe when I got  married, but it came from her good friend, Sue.    Sprinkle nut mixture around greased tube or bundt pan.    Mix all cake ingredients with mixer. Pour first layer in pan. Add strusel  mixture. Add more cake mixture and alternate layers leaving a little nut  mixture for top. Bake 50-60 minutes at 350 degrees.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Amy R" <amyrze@hotmail.com> on Oct 10,  1998,
