salt and pepper, Fresh basil, chopped, Green bell pepper, diced, Stock, as necessary, Garlic, Green beans, fresh or frozen, Ripe tomatoes, chopped, Spaghetti, olive oil, Parsley, 
Heat oil gently in a large pot.  Add the garlic & saute for 30  seconds. Add the green bell pepper & continue to saute gently for 1  minute or so. Add the green beans & stir well.  Add the tomatoes,  stir & simmer for 10 minutes.  Add the basil, parsley, salt & pepper.  Continue to cook until the tomatoes are rendered into a sauce.  You  may wish to add some stock, but do not add too much or the sauce will  become very watery.  Check seasonings.    Serve hot sauce tossed over cooked spaghetti with lots of home-made  garlic bread on the side.    Recipe by Mark Satterly    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/vegan4.zip
