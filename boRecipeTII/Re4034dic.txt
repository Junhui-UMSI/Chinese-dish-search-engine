Heat slowly, stirring  constantly, until sugar dissolves, then cook, stirring, until mixture  reaches 300 on a candy thermometer (a tsp of syrup will separate into  brittle threads when dropped into cold water).    Stir in food coloring and extract until blended; remove from heat.    Drop from tip of a teaspoon onto well oiled cookie sheets to make 1 1/2  inch rounds,or spoon into well oiled 1 1/2 inch molds. If syrup hardens  while shaping drops, heat slowly until just melted.    Cool on cookie sheets or in molds until firm, then remove carefully with  spatula.
