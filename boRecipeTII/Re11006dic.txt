Raels Purty Darn Good Redbean-N-Rice Burritos Adobo
See instructions, 
Seriously good. Just made these puppies. Use leftover RB&R, preferably  (always better the next day, ya know). Anywho, heat the leftovers up,  getchya a couple o three tortillas, grease em up well with your favorite  hotsauce(s), throw in a nice amount of the RB&R, some sauteed red onions  (saute em up in some balsamic vin. for a strange, but good, flavor(-ing)),  roll that baby up, cover it in some adobo sauce, hit it with some jack  cheese, if desired, mind you, bake, serve, eat, belch, and thank El Grande  for chiles and thank any other higher power you may subscribe to for food  in general. Could throw a nice fruity salsa in there with it <he thinks,  eyeing some canned pineapple....hmmm...>    Belch again, if desired.    Nothing special, nothing exotic, but damned if they dont go down good...    Peace, Hendrix, and CHiles.......
