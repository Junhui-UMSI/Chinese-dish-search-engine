People are always telling me that they cannot make good gravy. The secret  to simplicity is in the roux and dry sherry. Its easy!      Add the broth to the skimmed drippings and reduce by one third.  Remove  from the heat and stir in the roux, using a wire whip. Return to the heat  and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens. Add the sherry and Kitchen  Bouquet, just to the desired color. Salt and pepper to taste. If too thick,  add a bit more broth and cook for a few moments.     sauteed mushrooms make a nice addition to this gravy. If you are still  unhappy with your efforts, try adding some Maggi seasonings liquid, a fine  product from Switzerland. It is most helpful.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
