Honeyed Apples
Peeled; cored and sliced, Honey, Vinegar, 
Source: The Joy of Cooking    Mix the honey and vinegar together in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Put  a few apple slices in, a few at a time and simmer them until they turn  translucent. Then skim them out and add another batch of apples and repeat  the process. Serve warm or cold.  This makes a fairly small amount - I would double or even triple this  recipe for a family of 5.    I was out of white vinegar when I wanted to try it out so I substituted red  wine vinegar. The result was very nice as a side dish for a roast! I mean  to try this with white vinegar as a dessert.
