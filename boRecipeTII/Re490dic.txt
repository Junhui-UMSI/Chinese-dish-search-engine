Lemon Pound Cake
Lemon zest, Salt, Egg, Butter, Sugar, Cake flour, 
Preheat the oven to 325F. Grease and Flour bundt pansor mini- loaf pans.  Put the butter in a large mixing bowl and beat until creamy. Slowly add  sugar, beating constantly, until the mixture is well blended. Add the eggs  one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the flour and salt and  beat until smooth and throughly blended. Add the lemon zest and beat  another few seconds. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth top with  spatula. Bake for about an hour or until a straw comes out clean when  inserted into the center. Let cool in the pan 5 minutes before turning onto  rack to cool completely.    NOTES : Using a food processer or standing mixer works best. Also the  original calls for loaf pans, but I never had luck with regular sized pans.  Mini-loaf or Bundt pans seems to work best.
