Basic Marinara Sauce
Sugar, Crushed tomatoes , Chopped, garlic, olive oil, Parsley, Fresh oregano, 
Place the oil and garlic into a 2 quart saucepan and heat just until  the aroma of the garlic releases - DONT overcook the garlic (it  shouldnt even turn brown)!  Pour in the crushed tomatoes and set  heat to simmer Stir in the sugar until disolved Stir in the oregano  and parsley Simmer for fifteen minutes    NOTES : Dried oregano can be used if you dont have fresh, but it  definitely affects the flavor.  This sauce can be used as a base for a  variety of recipes - its great as a pizza sauce; loves to have things  added to it like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms etc. and is even  better after it has set for a day.    Cooking Tip: When removing the cover from a simmering pot of tomato  sauce, dont let the condensation from the lid drip back into the  sauce. Its acidity will effect the flavor.
