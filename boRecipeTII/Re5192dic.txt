Pikelets
Self-raising flour, Vanilla essence, Sour milk, Butter, White sugar, Egg, 
This is really an off the top af my head recipe .. but with a large  collection of young sisters it really does the trick. SECRET  : Use SOUR MILK. If you dont have any add about 1 tsp of white vinegar and  leave it to curdle (about 5 minutes) PIKELETS  : (Quantities off the top of my head .. but should be about right) - Sift  flour into a medium mixing bowl or bowl for electric mixer          ( Can also use a blender, milkshake maker, etc..) - Break egg into a  cup - beat with fork - Combine Egg/ Vanilla essence/ about 1/2 cup of milk  and mix - Add above mixture to flour. Beat vigourously. Add milk until  mixture          is about the consistency of wood glue.. bubbles should remain on          surface of mixture. Im sorry this is imprecise, but afew experiments          should get it about right. - Leave mixture to sit for about 10  minutes. - Heat frypan/gridle to a medium temp (I use about 6 on a scale  1-10) - (I transfer mixture to a jug at this point) - Add about 1tsp of oil  to frypan (more if mot using a non-stick frypan)          Pour mixture into pan to form pikelets of requird size (2"-4")          Turn when bubbles burst and dont fill in. They will only take about          half a minute once they are turned!!          If the underside is burnt reduce heat .. if uncooked increase it :) -  Serve with Jam/Cream, Honey, Maple Syrup, Vegemite, Whatever!!! I know this  is a bit rough.. but It shouldnt take long to pick up the art.    MATT@PHYSICS.SU.OZ.AU (DR_BUNGO)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
