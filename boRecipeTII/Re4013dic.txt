Recipe By     : Terrific Pacific Cookbook    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 23 November 96    Date:    Sat, 23 Nov 1996 21:22:32 -0500    From:    Randee Fried <Noellekk@AOL.COM>    NOTES : Asian believe there is nothing like a tart, spicy beginning to a  meal to tease the appetite, tantalize the palate, & aid digestion. This  spiky    tamarind broth, called Rassam (which simply means broth) is of South Indian    provenance. The recipe was given to me by a dignified elderly Tamil man we    encountered on an agternoon stroll through the Indian quarter of Peneng.  This    is a soup that is supposed to be drunk rather than eaten with a spoon, so    offer small cups of this delicious brew to your guests before proceeding to    dinner.
