Eggplants with Labaneh
Eggplants, Coarse salt, Flour, Vegetable oil, olive oil, Pine seeds, 
First you slice the eggplants without peeling them, about 1/2 inch thick.  Put them in a slieve and sprinkle them generously with salt (if possible  coarse sea salt, but any other salt would do). Let the bitter fluid go.  After one hour you wash the eggplants with running water. You dry the  slices with a towel. Dip them in the flour and deep fry them in the boiling  oil. Recover the slices, put them on baking paper or directly on a serving  plate, one next to the other.    When the plate is full, take your prepared Labane, and distribute it in  rings on the slices like the topping of a cake. Leave an empty space in the  middle. In the meantime heat the olive oil in a small pan, do not overheat.  Add the pine seeds. Be careful not to burn them but only to slightly brown  them. Immediately take off the heat and distribute with a tablespoon some  pine seeds and some olive oil over the eggplant slices with the Labaneh.    Serve immediately.    An absolutely delicious and easy (once you tested it and know all the  little tricks) apperitif for as many guests as you like, when they arrive.  Calculate 2 slices per person.
