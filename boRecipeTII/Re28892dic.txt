Thai Lemongrass Lemonade
Lime juice, Lemon juice, lemongrass, Sugar, Water, salt, 
Combine water and lemongrass in a pot or saucepan. Boil and add sugar. Stir  until sugar has dissolved. Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.    Let cool 1 hour and pour into a glass pitcher, straining out the lemongrass  stalks. Add lemon, lime juices, and salt. Stir. Add ice to glasses and  drink.    Serves: 4 (we drank it all and wanted more, see notes below) - this will  probably serve more, less thirsty people.  *Note: This recipe requires (begs) for FRESH lemongrass. Using old  lemongrass (it begins to smell old,or not smell like, well, fresh  lemongrass) will cause the lemongrass lemonade to smell like youve used  water from the disposal in your sink. Not removing the lemongrass will  achieve the same effect, but to a lesser extent.    **Second note: The weekend we first tried it, we made and drank it ALL.  Made a second batch and drank it. On the third batch, I used old lemongrass  and, unfortunately, crocked the double batch. It was bitter, slightly, but  I drank it anyway (this batch took a few days to finish).
