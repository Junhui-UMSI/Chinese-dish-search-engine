It is also juicy, fragrant and  delicious for eating out of hand and packed with nutritional pluses.  A  medium size pear contains 100 calories, and has generous amounts of  vitamins C and E as well as potassium. They are fat-free and fibrous. They  are very popular in Europe. Barbara Burman of Cape Fruit in America says  that it is the most versatile cooking fruit she can think of.  It was  introduced in South America in 1922. It has been exported to this country  by Cape Fruit for nearly 40 years.  They are found in the spring.  Recipe by: Cape Fruit Co.
