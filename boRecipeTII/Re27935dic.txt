Rosemary sticks are sturdy enough to cook on and add extra flavor. If you  cant find them, bamboo skewers will do. For lemon marinade, stir together  chicken broth, lemon peel, lemon juice, honey, rosemary, salt and pepper in  a small mixing bowl. Cut pork into 3/4" cubes. Place meat in a plastic bag  set into a large bowl. Pour marinade over meat. Seal bag and turn to coat  meat well. Marinate in refrigerator 1-2 hours, turning bag occasionally.  Place rosemary sticks or bamboo skewers in water; soak 30 minutes. Remove  pork from bag, reserving marinade. Thread 4 pork cubes on each rosemary  stick or skewer. Brush with reserved marinade. Grill on the rack of an  uncovered grill directly over medium coals about 10 minutes or until pork  is tender and juices run clear, turning once halfway through grilling. Or,  to broil, place kabobs on the unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 5-6"  from the heat about 8 minutes or till pork is done, turning and brushing  with reserved marinade halfway through broiling time. Makes 12.
