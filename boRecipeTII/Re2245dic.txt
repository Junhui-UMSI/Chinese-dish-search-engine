Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-in nonstick skillet over  medium-high heat. When hot, add vegetables and fennel seeds. Sprinkle with  1/2 teaspoon salt and stirfry until vegetables are barely tender, about 3  minutes. Stir in red pepper flakes to taste, garlic and pasta sauce. Taste  and adjust seasoning; mixture should be highly seasoned.    3. Transfer mixture to large bowl, add pasta and toss well. Layer 1/2 pasta  in shallow greased 2 1/2 - quart casserole. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups  mozzarella. top with remaining pasta and sprinkle with remaining  mozzarella. (recipe can be prepared several hours ahead and kept at room  temperature.)    4.
