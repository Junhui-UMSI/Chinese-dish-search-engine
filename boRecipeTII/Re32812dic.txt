This is simply a fancy way of serving sweet potatoes. In the North we eat  sweet potatoes only during the winter holidays, but in the South this dish  is on the table at every Sunday supper. We would be wise in the North to  put a wider variety of vegetables on the table regularly, and the South can  teach us how to do it. This one can be served very often.      Boil the potatoes with the skins on until tender. Peel, and run the  vegetables through a potato ricer into an electric mixing bowl. Add the  remaining ingredients, except the optional marshmallows, and whip until  light. I use my KitchenAid for this and the potatoes are absolutely fluffy!  Place in a baking dish and top with the marshmallows. Bake at 375? for 10  minutes or until the marshmallows brown and the dish is hot.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
