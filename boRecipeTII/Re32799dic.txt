Saute the onions in a little broth in a large non-stick frying pan til  very soft, adding broth as needed. Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Add  more broth, grated sweet potatos and spices, and stir for about 10 minutes  over medium heat until sweet potato is tender. This will require attention  and more broth, as the sweet potatoes will stick, even to the non-stick  surface. But dont be to vigorous with the stirring or the sweet potatoes  will turn to mush.     When tender, make sure all broth has evaporated and remove the sweet  potato mixture from the heat. Put 1 tortilla each in the bottom of 4 metal  pie pans of about the same diameter as the tortillas. Divide the sweet  potato mixture between the pans and top with the cheese. Cover with the  remaining tortillas and press down firmly. Bake at 425 degrees F. for about  10-12 minutes, until the tops are beginning to brown, and the tortillas are  crispy.  Remove from the pie pans with a spatula, and cut into wedges to  serve. Serves 4.     Notes: The use of cheese (or a substitute that melts) is important for  serving, or the top tortillas will not stay in place. If using glass pans,  Pam is needed. We cut this in half for 2 and are usually stuffed afterward  if we have a vegetable as well.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #36    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
