Ramen Seasoning Packet Uses
WOMANS DAY; 3/12/1996, 
Some ways to use those leftover seasoning packets:    Soup base: add 1 packet to 2 c water.    Roast potatoes: Toss 1 lb quartered, small, red-skinned potatoes with oil  to lightly coat, then sprinkle evenly with 1 seasoning packet before  roasting.    Pan gravy: stir into pan drippings along with flour. Whisk in water instead  of stock.    Cutlet, chop, and fish coating: mix 1 packet per 2 tb flour for dredging.    Season ground meat for burgers, meatballs, and meat loaf: mix 1 packet per  lb ground meat.    Tyops courtesy of Sylvia Steiger.
