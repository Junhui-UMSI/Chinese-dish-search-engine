Got this recipe off of Neosofts recipe site at:    http://www.neosoft.com/recipes/    It is a good site with thousands of recipes. They had like 8 different  lasagne recipes.  COOKING DIRECTIONS: Brown ground beef in 3 quart saucepan with minced  garlic; drain. Add spaghetti sauce and simmer for 10 minutes. Cook lasagne  according to package directions; drain. Separate lasagne and lay out flat  on wax paper or aluminum foil to keep pieces from sticking together as they  cool.) Combine cheeses, egg whites, parsley, basil, oregano, salt, and  pepper for filling. Pour about 1/2 cup meat sauce on bottom of 13" x 9"  baking pan. Arrange 4 pieces of lasagne lengthwise over sauce, overlapping  edges. Spread 1/3 of the cheese filling evenly over lasagne and cover with  about 1 cup meat suace. Repeat layers of lasagne, cheese, and meat sauce  twice. Top with a layer of lasagne and remaining meat sauce; sprinkle with  additional parmesan cheese, if desired. Cover with aluminum foil; bake at  350 degrees for 30 minutes (until hot and bubbly). Remove foil and bake for  10 more minutes, until lightly browned. Allow to stand for 10 minutes  before cutting for easier handling. 10 to 12 servings.  Posted to FOODWINE Digest 19 Mar 97 by =Mark <mstevens@EXIT109.COM> on Mar  19, 1997
