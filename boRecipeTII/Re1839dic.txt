LATIN AMERICAN COOKING ACROSS THE USA by Novas and Silva    Rinse the chicken under cold running water. Put the chicken, water, half of  the minced onions, 2 cloves garlic, and the salt and pepper in a large  stockpot. Bring to a boil, covered, over medium-high heat, then reduce the  heat and simmer the chicken, covered, for 1+1/2 hours.    Remove the chicken from the stock to a large plate. Bone the chicken  breasts and cut into bite-size chunks. Return the chunks of chicken breast  to the pot. Reserve the rest of the chicken meat for another use.    Cut the pieces of yuca in half lengthwise, cut away the fibrous core in the  center of each piece with a paring knife, then cut the yuca into 1/2-inch  chunks. Add the yuca, potatoes, the remaining onions and 2 cloves garlic,  and the cumin to the stock. Bring to a boil, covered, then reduce the heat  and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.    Add the plantains and lemon juice to the soup, and continue simmering until  the plantains are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the soup from the heat,  and stir in the scallions and cilantro. Taste and adjust the seasoning, and  serve at once.    Serves 8 to 10 as a first course and 4 to 5 as a main entree.    Source: Latin American Cooking Acorss The U.S.A.
