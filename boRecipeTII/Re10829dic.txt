Quinoa is an ancient South American  high-protein grain recently popularized in the United States. This pearly,  nutty grain adds texture and nutritional value to a bread that makes good  toast or sandwiches with tuna, cold meat, or an assertive cheese.    To cook quinoa, add it to twice its measure of boiling water.  Simmer for  10 min.  Drain off any excess liquid and let cool.    Add the cooked quinoa and all remaining ingredients in the order suggested    by your bread machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according  to the manufacturers directions.    aaaaah-Excellent!!
