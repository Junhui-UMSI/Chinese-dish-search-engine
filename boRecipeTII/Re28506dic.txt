The World Of Jewish Cooking, Gil Marks    Method:    Preheat the oven to 375-degrees F. Set aside a baking dish large enough to  fit the fish.    Sprinkle the fish with the salt and pepper and place in the baking dish.  Drizzle with the butter or oil. Add enough water to almost cover the fish.    Place in the oven and poach, basting occasionally, until tender, about 35  minutes for 3 pounds, about 50 minutes for 4 pounds.    Transfer the fish to a serving platter and drizzle with the pomegranate  sauce. Garnish with the pomegranate sees or parsley. This is frequently  served with fried eggplant slices.    Pomegranate Sauce Cut the fruit in half. Squeeze the juice into a strainer  and discard the hard white kernels.    Boil the pomegranate juice until reduced almost by half. Add the onion,  basil, coriander, and garlic. Let cool.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #038    From: Pat Gold <plgold@ix.netcom.com>    Date: Wed, 25 Sep 1996 09:50:22 -0700
