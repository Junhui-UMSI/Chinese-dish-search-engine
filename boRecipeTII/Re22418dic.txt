powdered sugar, Eggs, CHOCOLATE FROSTING, Flour, Butter or margarine, Unsweetened Chocolate, milk, Pecan halves, Baking soda, Butter or margarine, Salt, Brown Sugar, Vanilla, 
Resift flour with soda and salt. Cream 1/2 cup butter and brown sugar  together thoroughly. Add 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk and beat well. Stir in  vanilla. Add dry ingredients and mix well. Arrange pecan halves in groups  of 3 or 5 on greased baking sheets to resemble head and legs of turtle.  Roll rounded teaspoons of dough into balls. Dip bottom of each into  remaining unbeaten egg white and press lightly onto nuts so tips of nuts  show. Bake at 350F 10 to 13 minutes. Cool.    Meanwhile, to make frosting, combine chocolate, milk and 1 tablespoon  butter in top of double boiler. Cook over simmering water, stirring until  smooth. Remove from heat and beat in powdered sugar until smooth and  glossy, adding more sugar if needed. Frost top of cookies.
