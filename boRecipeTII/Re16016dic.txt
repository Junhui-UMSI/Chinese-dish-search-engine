http://www.lowfatlife.com/chipotle.htm    Drain and rinse the soaked beans; place them in a large saucepan with the  water, oregano or marjoram sprig, sage, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then  reduce the heat and cook, uncovered, at a gentle boil until tender, 30 to  35 minutes. While the beans are cooking, water-saute the onion and 1/2  teaspoon salt over medium heat until the onion softens, about 5 minutes,  then add the garlic, cumin, and dried oregano. Keep the onion on very low  heat. Add the beans and their broth to the onion with 1/2 teaspoon salt and  the chile purees. Cook, uncovered, over medium-low heat for 20 to 30  minutes. If the beans need more liquid, add a little water to keep the dish  saucy. Add the orange juice, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, and the cilantro just  before serving. Add salt to taste and a splash of vinegar if needed. For  spicier beans, add more of the Ancho and Chipotle purees.    Ancho and Chipotle Puree - Soak dried chilies in boiling water until soft.  Remove seeds if you want a miler puree. Place soaked chilies in a food  processor and add enough of the soaking water to make a thick puree.
