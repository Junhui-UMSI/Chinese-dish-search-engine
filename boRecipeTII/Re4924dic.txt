Pickled Ginger
Sugar, Fresh ginger root, Rice vinegar, Water, 
Combine sugar, vinegar (use ONLY rice vinegar) and water in 1-pint jar with  tight-fitting lid. Peel ginger then cut it into long, PAPER-THIN slices  using a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler. Place the slices in the pickling  liquid. Refrigerate at least 2 to 3 weeks before using. Yield: 1 pint. If  kept submerged in the liquid, this will keep indefinitely in the  refrigerator.
