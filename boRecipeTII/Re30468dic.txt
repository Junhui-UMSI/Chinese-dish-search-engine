Banana Muffins
Sugar, Vegetable oil, Salt, Ripe bananas, Baking soda, Baking Powder, Egg, Flour, Walnuts; optional, 
Preheat oven to 375degrees. Place cupcake papers in tin. Mash bananas in  large bowl. Mix in sugar and egg. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda  and salt. Add to banana mixture alternately with oil. Stir in walnuts. Fill  tins 2/3 full. Bake until golden and tester comes out clean...approx 25 -30  minutes.    NOTES : This is probably my favorite banana muffin.  Simple and low fat.  I  do not sift anything...do not mash bananas.  I beat them before adding the  other ingredients.  One bowl..quick!!   I usually do not use nuts.  Recipe by: Bon Appetit?    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 478 by "bertnevie"  <tess@shore.intercom.net> on Jan 8, 1998
