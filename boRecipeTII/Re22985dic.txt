Place crawfish in a large bowl and sprinkle with all but 3 tsp. of the  salt. Allow to set for 20 minutes. Bring one gallon water to a boil in a 6  quart stock pot. Wash crawfish in several changes of fresh water until the  water runs clear. Add the clean crawfish to the stockpot and bring the  water back to a boil.    In a heavy gauge pot, heat oil until very hot. Add flour, stirring  constantly until the roux turns dark chestnut in color. Add garlic, bay  leaves, black peppercorns and thyme. When the garlic is blonde, add onions,  celery and bell peppers. When onions are translucent, add tomato paste and  lower heat. When paste is cooked out, add Rotel tomatoes.    Drain the crawfish, reserving the liquid. Peel. Pass the crawfish and the  liquid through a food mill, strain and add 1/2 of the liquid to the roux  and bring to a boil. Smooth out paste and add remaining liquid to the roux.  Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer for one hour. Adjust seasonings  with salt, cayenne Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce. Serve very hot.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 510 by jecraig@lan-inc.com on  Jan 13, 98
