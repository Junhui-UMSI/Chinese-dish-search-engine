TAMALES WORLD TOUR SHOW #WT1B21, TUSCAN RISOTTO AND SALAD DINNER    Wipe the fresh mushrooms clean with a damp paper towel. Break into  bitesized pieces and reserve. Soak dried porcini in enough boiling water to  cover for about 1/2 hour, or until pliable. Drain them, reserving the  soaking liquid, and rinse mushrooms under running water. Chop into  bitesized pieces and add to fresh mushrooms. Strain soaking liquid, add to  stock and set aside.    Heat oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium low heat. Cook onions  with salt and pepper until soft and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in  garlic and cook until aroma is released, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and  saute until golden. Add brandy, turn heat to high, and scrape bottom of pan  with a wooden spoon to release brown bits.    Light alcohol with a match. When flame subsides, add rice and saute until  slightly colored, about 1 minute. Add bay leaves and 1/2 cup stock. Bring  to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook until near dry.    Once the liquid is evaporated, briefly saute rice. Then, add stock 1/2 cup  at a time, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon until absorbed. Repeat  procedure, stirring constantly and briefly sauteing between additions,  until all stock has been absorbed. You must constantly stir while cooking  rice. When done, the rice should be glazed outside and soft throughout. It  takes approximately 20 minutes to add all the stock. Stir in Parmesan  cheese. Serve immediately.    Yield: 4 to 6 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 25, 1998
