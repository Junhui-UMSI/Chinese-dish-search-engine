Dag Maluah (Salted Fish)
Mackerel, Salt, 
clean the fish and pat dry. In a tin (like the one for English Cake) spread  salt to cover the bottom. put the fish in it and fill the belly with salt  and cover on top with more salt. Youll need about 1 cup or more.  Refrigirate for 24-48 hours but not more.    Rinse the fish and cut in slices about 1/4 inch or 1 cm. You can serve as  is on the same day, or with lemon juice, oil and onions, and if you like  black olives. It can be an appetizer or on a buffet or with drinks, great  with cream cheese and chala. I make at least two at a time. One goes in an  instant. The second is skinned and sliced and put in a jar with lemon &  onion wedges in alternate layers, covered with 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 oil.  This way it will keep for a month in the fridge.    This is really an "old world" recipe as the story in my family is that my  grandfather was the expert on it and he is gone over 90 years ago.
