Wojape (Wo Zha Pee)
Sugar, Bag (5 lb) frozen berrys, Water, Cornstarch, 
Wojape (Wo-zha-pee) A pudding, a dessert. Wojape is a classic Plains Indian  dish that predates most of us living now. It was made with fresh wild  berries collected during that season and also dried berries, preserved for  use through the winter. The berries were mixed with sugar when it became  available, and also flour. Today is a different time and Wojape, like many  other things, has adapted to the easy access of ingredients. However, it is  just as delicious. It can be eaten after a meal as a dessert or as many  "out there" know, as a main course maybe with a hot cup of coffee.       Many thanks for this recipe go to:     Ms. Stacy Winter of Rapid City, South Dakota.       To a 5 quart pot (enamel or stainless steel) add all the berries and  smash them with a potato masher. (If you are fortunate enough to have a  food processor this would work fine also. However, stop just short of  puree, you want fine pieces throughout.)       To the smashed berries add the water and sugar. Boil (lightly) this  mixture (Approximately 15 to 20 minutes) until everything is cooked.  Thicken to desired thickness with cornstarch that has been dissolved in  cold water.       Serve warm and eat with Indian Fry Bread. Dip the bread into the Wojape  and eat in this manner.
