From: alchazal@msuvx1.memphis.edu    Date: 8 Apr 1994 23:04:22 -0400  This is a quick recipe for brownies (or Mississippi Mud Cake in some parts  of the country). My cousin once called this "Atomic Brownies" (biochem  major at Columbia) because they were so dense with chocolate !    Melt 2 sticks margarine with 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate. Add 2 cups  of sugar and 2 tsps. vanilla.  Let cool slightly. Add 4 eggs, lightly  beaten. Then add 1 c. plus 2 tlbs. flour. Add 1 1/2 c. chopped nuts. Spread  in 13x9x2 baking dish and bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes. Cover with the  following icing: 1/4 c. margarine heated with 4 tlbs. evaporated milk. Add  2 c. powdered sugar, 1/3 c. cocoa, and 1 tsp. vanilla. Spread on brownies  and cut in squares when cold (important). Enjoy !!
