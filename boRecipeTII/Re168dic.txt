Kumquat Marmalade
Kumquats, Water, Sugar, 
Cut the kumquats open and remove the pulp from the skins.  Cover the skins with cold water and cook until they are tender. If you don't want a bitter flavor then you will need to drain and repeat this process at least 4 times during the cooking time, replacing the cold water each time.      When the skins are tender, grind them. In the meantime, cover the fruit pulp with 3 cups of the water and simmer for about 30 minutes.   Strain and add the rest of the water to the juice.    Discard the pulp and the seeds.   Add the sugar and the ground skins.      Cook this mixture until the syrup jells.      Pour into hot sterile jars and seal.      Yields 6 small jars.
