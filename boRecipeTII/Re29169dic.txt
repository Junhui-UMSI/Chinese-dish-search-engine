Baked Salmon Supper
Cucumber, Mayonnaise, Salt, Dill Weed, Salmon, 
Rinse the salmon fillets and pat dry with paper towels.  Place fillets on a  raised rack in a 9" x 12" greased baking dish.  Sprinkle with salt. Layer  thinly sliced cucumber over each fillet.  Stir dill weed into mayonnaise  and spread over salmon and cucumber.  Bake in 375 oven for 30 minutes, or  until salmon flakes when tested with a fork.    Serve with a fresh Winter Orange salad, steaming baked potatoes topped with  a pat of butter and french bread from your local bakery.    Serves 8.
