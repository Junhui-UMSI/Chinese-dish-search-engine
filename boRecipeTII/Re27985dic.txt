Three Fruit Marmalade
Lemons, Grapefruit, Salt, Oranges, Sugar, 
Heres a marmalade recipe with some really citrus-y pizzazz! This will  make about 12 6-oz. jars... Scrub the fruit and slice very thin, saving the  juice. Discard the seeds and the grapefruit core. Measure the fruit and  juice.  Put the fruit and juice in a large pot and add three times as much  water.  Simmer, covered, for 2 hours, and then let stand overnight. Measure  the fruit and liquid, then add an equal amount of sugar and a sprinkle of  salt.  Cook rapidly, in two or three batches, until the jellying point  (when jelly slides off cold metal spoon in a sheet rather than in separate  droplets) is reached,    stirring frequently. Pour into hot, STERILIZED jars and seal. Susan  Argyelan    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #121 by EUGF52A@prodigy.com (MR DAVID H  WIELAND) on Apr 30, 1997
