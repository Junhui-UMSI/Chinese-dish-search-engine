Bacon and Egg Fried Rice
cooked rice, Black pepper, Bacon, -(up to), Soy sauce, Eggs, Cooking wine, Onion, 
This is more like American homestyle, not Chinese-resaurant style:     Break up the lumps in the cold rice with your hand; set aside. Prepare  other ingredients before cooking. Mix the soy sauce and wine in a small  dish.     Fry the bacon in a wok on high heat until nearly crisp. Remove most of the  fat, leaving ~2 tbsp or less. Add the onions and fry with bacon until soft  and golden. Push the bacon/onions to the side and scramble the eggs in the  fat at the bottom of the wok. Add the rice and mix everything together  until rice is hot. Sprinkle with soy sauce/wine and pepper and stir to mix.     Note: I like how this works with long-grain better than short-grain rice.
