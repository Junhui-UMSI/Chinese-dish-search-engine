Thai Pepper Rum
Vanilla extract, Thai peppers; whole,, Lime juice, Distilled white vinegar, 6-oz floozy bottle, Stick cinnamon, Bacardi Silver Label 80, 
Heat scale : 6 (delayed, short lived)    NOTE: *scale up for rum bottles; for a fifth, I would probably drop in a  vanilla bean, and I would probably split it lengthwise. Directions: put  everything in the bottle.  wait 3 months. Notes: The acid keeps the peppers  from spoiling, and the rum will eventually develop a dangerous looking  orange hue.  Ive stored it at room temp.  If you taste it, you should get  a rum taste with a hint of cinnamon (the vanilla is masked by the rum),  followed by a 2 or 3 second delay, and then a pure heat phenomena. There  isnt any taste when the heat kicks in, and it only flashes by. I only had  the bravado to taste a drop on my finger!    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
