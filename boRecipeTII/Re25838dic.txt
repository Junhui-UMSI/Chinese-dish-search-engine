Add a line of caviar inside of the salmon, then  sprinkle with chives.         Close the fish.  In a saute pan, heat white wine.  Add shallot puree  and bay leaf.  Place the fish in the saute pan (belly down) and bake in a  350 - 400 F oven for 20 minutes.  When fish is cooked, remove from pan,  remove the skin and reserve in a warm place.  Heat juices in saute pan for  a couple of minutes.  Strain juices into a saucepan containing a wine  butter sauce (see page 28).    For the Assembly and Garnish:  =============================         Place the baby salmon on a serving dish.  Ladle some of the  salmon-flavored red wine sauce over half the fish and the wine butter  sauce (flavored with the poaching liquid) over the other half.         Garnish with cucumber, tomato, chives, salmon eggs, and crayfish tails  (boiled).
