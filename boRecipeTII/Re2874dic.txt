Peanut Butter Fudge #02
Sugar, Vanilla, Cocoa, Creamy peanut butter, milk, Butter, 
Mix sugar, cocoa & milk in skillet (we use an iron skillet). Mix well. Cook  until boiling, stirring constantly. When small amount of mixture can be  dropped into a cup of tap water & forms a hard ball, cook 3 minutes more.  Remove from heat. Add vanilla, butter & peanut butter. Stir hard until  fudge begins thickening & pour into a greased 13x9-inch dish. (Hard ball  stage is important. If you cook too long, fudge may get hard before you  start to pour it. If you do not cook long enough, fudge may remain soft.)    TERESA BOYD    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.
