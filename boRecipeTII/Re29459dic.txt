Baking Butter Graham Cracker Crust
Baking soda, Sugar, Water, Baking Butter; Mrs., Lowfat graham crackers, 
Soften Baking Butter in the microwave for 20 seconds and mix it with the  warm water. In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients and mix well  until moistened. Divid the crumb mixture into 2, 9" vegetable sprayed pie  pans and press evenly on the bottom and up the sides. I prefer not TOO  thick a crust. Bake at 350 F. for 15 minutes. Cool. Fill with any kind of  filling you like.    These would freeze well, tightly wrapped.    Note: Mrs. Batemans Butterlike (tm) Baking Butter (tm) is a very low-fat  butter substitute that I have been pleased with, overall.
