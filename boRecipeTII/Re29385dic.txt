Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    Cook vermicelli according to package directions. Drain and place into a  baking dish that has been buttered, oiled or sprayed with cooking spray.    Melt butter in a sauce pan, and add onions and saute until transparent. Add  flour to make a roux and cook for about 3 or 4 minutes. Add the milk and  stir until hot. Remove about a cup of the milk and set aside. Add the  cheeses to the saucepan and continue stirring untill the cheese has melted.  Add the spices. Gradually add the eggs to the cooled reserved milk and beat  until the eggs are incorporated. Stirring continuously, add the eggs to the  saucepan a little at a time. Continue stirring and cook until the sauce  begins to thicken. Pour the cheese sauce over the vermicelli and sprinkle  withe the breadcrumbs. Bake for 30 minutes or until brown on top.    For a really neat looking dish, do a crust of breadcrumbs by layering the  bottom and sides of the baking dish with beaten egg followed by a layer of  breadcrumbs. Repeat several times. Then bake and unmold onto a serving  plate.    Recipe By     : George McTyre <MCTYREG@baylor.edu>
