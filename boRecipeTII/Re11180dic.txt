The first, "Malt Loaf  (Light)", is my mother-in-laws recipe for malt loaf (sorry, I dont know  where she got it from). It is a lighter and firmer loaf than is usually  sold in supermarkets, although it is still very nice. The second, "Malt  Bread", and third, "Raisin Malt Loaf", are both from the Good Housekeeping  Cookery Encyclopaedia -- one is for a yeasted malt bread, and one is for a  malt loaf which looks as though it should be much like the UK supermarket  variety.    Grease and line a loaf tin (about 8.5" x 4.5" top dimension). Sieve the dry  ingredients, add the raisins. Melt the malt and syrup in half the milk.  Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the malt  mixture. Add more milk as necessary to give a sticky, soft consistency.  Pour into tin and bake 1 - 1 1/4 hours at 160 C, 325 F, gas mark 3. Turn  out to cool on wire rack, and (attempt to) keep for 24 hours before  serving.
