Tomato Sauce Patrica Wells
Celery leaves, Garlic, Crushed tomatoes in puree, Several sprigs of parsley,, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Onion; minced, Sea salt, 
In a large unheated saucepan, combine the oil, onion, garlic and salt and  stir to coat with oil. Cook over moderate heat just until the garlic turns  golden but does not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. If using whole canned tomatoes,  place a food mill over the skillet and puree the tomatoes directly into it.  Crushed tomatoes can be added directly from the can. Add the herb bundle,  stir to blend, and simmer, uncovered, until the sauce begins to thicken,  about 15 minutes. For a thicker sauce, for pizzas and toppings, cook for 5  minutes more. Taste for seasoning. Remove and discard the herb bundle. The  sauce may be used immediately, stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days,  or frozen for up to 2 months. If small quantities of sauce will be needed  for pizzas or other toppings, freeze in ice cube trays.
