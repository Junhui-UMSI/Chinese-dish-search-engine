Baked Pumpkin and Onions

I cant give the amounts on this one. Its much too simple for that. Its  just an old-fashioned way of serving the great American squash. Make as  little or as much as you like. Your kids will love it.      Clean and peel some pumpkin and cut it into thick slices. Arrange them in  a buttered baking dish and add sliced onions. Add salt and pepper and a bit  of melted butter or olive oil. Repeat with another layer and top with a few  spoons of brown sugar.      Bake, uncovered, at 350? until tender, about 30 minutes. You may wish to  cook it longer.      I generally serve this as a vegetable dish.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
