Welsh Lamb Pie
Carrots; sliced, Salt, Short crust pastry, Neck of lamb, Beaten egg to glaze, Onion, Parsley, 
Remove all bones from the lamb and dice the meat, set aside. Put the bones  in a saucepan and add the onion, water to cover and season. Bring to a boil  and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Strain the stock.    Line a pie dish with half of the pastry. Put in diced lamb, carrots and  parsley and season. Cover with the remaining pastry, and seal and flute the  edge. Make a small hole in the center of the pastry lid and brush with  beaten egg. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 2 hours or until the pastry is  golden brown. Pour the stock through the hole in the lid, adding enough to  fill the pie, and leave to cool before serving.
