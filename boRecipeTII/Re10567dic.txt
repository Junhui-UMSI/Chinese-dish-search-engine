Quick Miso Soup (t)
vegetable broth, Red barley miso, tofu, Green onion, 
Heat broth/water until just boiling. Meanwhile, chop green onion and tofu,  and put 1 tsp miso in bottom of 4 bowls, more if you like. When broth  boils, pour it into the soup bowls, stir the miso a bit to break it up, and  add the tofu and green onion.    Makes 4 one cup servings.
