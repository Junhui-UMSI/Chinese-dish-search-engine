Heres a few Thai Prawn recipes - one for soup and two curries. If you are  not familiar with some of the ingredients, any Asian grocery store will be  able to help you. Or email me if you have any questions. I got these  recipes from "The Lemon Grass and Galangal Cookbook".    Place coconut milk, water, galangal, lemon grass, lime leaves, chili paste  and white pepper in a sauce pan and bring slowly to a boil. Do not heat to  strongly or coconut milk might curdle. When stock is boiling, add prawns,  reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until prawns are cooked. Remove  lime leaves, add fish sauce and lime juice. Garnish with coriander leaves.    Yield - 4 cups    Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Sep 96    From:    Serene Ong <sereneo@INFO.BISHKEK.SU>    Date:    Thu, 12 Sep 1996 03:54:41 +0700
