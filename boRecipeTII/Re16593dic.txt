Aioli
Salt, Egg yolks  /, olive oil, Garlic, milk, Lemon juice, Boiling water, Thick slice French bread, 
I find a recipe in my Encyclopedia of Cooking by JoAnna Morris for aioli.  Here it is: Remove the crusts from bread and soak in milk.   Squeeze dry. Place in large mortar with garlic & mash with pestle until a  fine paste.  Add the yolks & salt & mash in. Drop by drop pound in olive  oil.  When the sauce becomes thick; the remaining oil may be beaten in.  Thin with water & lemon juice to taste. FROM: PAM HOUGLAN (KFNR49B)
