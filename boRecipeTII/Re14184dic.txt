Melt 8 ounces premium or imported white chocolate, chopped, with 1 cup  heavy or whipping cream in medium saucepan over very low heat, stirring  frequently, until completely smooth. Cool completely to room temperature.  Beat 1 more cup heavy cream with a pinch salt in mixer bowl. Whisk one  quarter of the whipped cream into cooled white-chocolate mixture, then fold  in remaining whipped cream. Spoon into champagne or dessert glasses. Cover  and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. Serve with Raspberry Sauce and semisweet  chocolate shavings (optional). Makes 8 servings. Raspberry Sauce: Process  1 package (10 oz.) frozen raspberries in light syrup in food processor.  Strain through sieve, discarding seeds. Makes 1 cup.    NOTES : Cooking white chocolate is a delicate matter - the secret is to  melt it gently over very low heat.
