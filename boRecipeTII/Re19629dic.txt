Whatever you do,  dont use creamy peanut butter!  With just 1/2 cup nut butter mixed with 2  cups flour, the nut taste gets kind of lost. I used almond butter; we also  used Cantbelieveitsnotbutter for the margarine. Dont round those Tbspfulls  too high, as these cookies wind up a bit on the large size. I also forgot  about flattening them out; oh well... What I have are chocolate chip  cookies (mini-chips), with a faint almond flavor.]    [If anyone knows of a BBS with the Cooking echo in Sparks or Reno NV,  please let me know!  Ill be staying at the Peppermill hotel for about 2  weeks, and may be able to modem out...]    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
