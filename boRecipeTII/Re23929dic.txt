Asparagus and Red Pepper Soup
Roasted red pepper, Asparagus, Veggie broth, Evap skim milk, 
1. Place asparagus and broth into 4 qt pan and simmer for 15 min., until  tender.    2. Puree asparagus/broth in blender. Take out some pieces for a chunkier  consistency if you wish.    3. Put puree back in pan and add red pepper, any reserved asparagus, black  pepper, and can of milk.    4. Heat until thickened to your liking.    NOTE: You can add some thickener(flour,cornstarch) to hasten the process. I  started the pepper roasting at about the same time as the the asparagus,  and it worked out fine to add to soup.    Serve with a salad and hearty bread!    Posted by mmk3@Lehigh.EDU (MARGARET M.
