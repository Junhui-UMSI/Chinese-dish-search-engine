Backcountry Couscous
Broccoli, Sesame seed salad dressing, Whole wheat couscous, 
Submitted by LynLord@aol.com    Couscous is a great backcountry food (though really bland). You can boil  water in any small pot, or even a tea kettle and just throw it in, and  wham, its done in minutes. This is a great little recipe that I often eat  at home (shhhh). Simply prepare the couscous per usual, then pour in a  heaping of the salad dressing to taste. Add the broccoli (I prefer it raw,  but you can boil it if need be). Those little Nalgene bottles are great for  keeping separate the salad dressing (Uncle Changs brand is best), which  you definitely dont want spilling over your pack contents...
