The recipes  were published in the 7-13-94 issue of the Tyler Courier-Times. Both Pam  and her mother are known by the family and their friends for their cooking.  (Not the low fat low cal kind) Sorry the article does not state the serving  size or time, but it does say the total time to prepare the whole meal is  45 minutes (preparing dishes before baking).    Mix ingredients and pour over shrimp in casserole dish. Marinade at least  one hour in refrigerator (preferably overnight). Bring back to room  temperature and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes for 3 pounds of shrimp or  a little longer for 5 pounds.
