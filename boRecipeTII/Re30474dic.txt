Banana Nut Bread
Ripe bananas, Black walnuts, Baking Powder, Eggs, Stick butter or margarine, Sour milk, Sugar, Salt, Flour, Baking soda, 
Mix all together.  Grease loaf pan.  Bake at 350? for 60-80 minutes.    When making a double batch--which I always do, use 5 bananas.  Seems to be  the correct taste!  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #195    Date: Mon, 12 Aug 1996 21:17:01 -0500    From: kathi sandler <kas@flash.net>
