Lace Cookies
Oatmeal, Brown sugar, Flour, Salt, Butter, Egg, Vanilla, 
These cookies are deadly!  There's not much to them.  Like potato chips, once you start eating them, it's hard to stop.  Follow cooling instructions for best results.  The cookies will be very thin (you can see through them, hence the name "lace").    Mix together oatmeal, brown sugar, flour and salt.    Add butter, egg and vanilla.  Set oven to 350F.    Use ungreased cookie sheets (I find  parchment/baking paper works great here).  Drop well-blended mixture onto cookie sheets by the 1/2 tsp full.   Cook 5 minutes.   Cool on cookie-sheets about 2 minutes before removing them to cooling rack.     Note:  Do NOT use more than a 1/2 teaspoon to drop batter onto pan.  It may look small, but it spreads!
