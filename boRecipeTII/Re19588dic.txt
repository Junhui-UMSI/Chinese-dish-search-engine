Using your hands, mix in the eggs, breaking the yolks  as you go, and as you mix, you add more and more of the flour to the center  and knead for 10 minutes. (Or just put it in the mixer and knead for 5  minutes.  Add more flour if mix becomes sticky. This is a good noodle  dough.  Form it into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap or foil. Let rest at room  temp for 30 minutes.    Filling: melt chicken fat, add onions, saute until soft and opaque. DO NOT  LET BURN. If using the beef, add and cook until it turns grey.  Remove from  heat, add parsley, salt and pepper. If using chicken, just add to onions  and seasonings. To make kreplach: Cut dough ball in thirds for easier  handling. Keep unused parts covered until using. Roll dough out on floured  board until it is very thin, about 1/8 inch. Trim off rough edges. Cut  dough into 2 1/2 inch squares. Place about a teaspoon filling into center  of each square. Fold dough in half to make a triangle. Moisten edges and  pinch to seal.  Repeat this with the rest of the dough and fillings. Let  kreplach sit on a floured board for 15-20 minutes before cooking them in a  large pot of salted, boiling water. Cook for 20 minutes, drain and broil to  brown them.  Or cook them for 25 minutes and serve immediately in chicken  soup.  Or instead of boiling, fry in hot oil to be served as appetizers.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 310    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
