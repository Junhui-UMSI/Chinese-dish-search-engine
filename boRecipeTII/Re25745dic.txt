1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Cover baking sheet with foil. Wipe  eggplant and pierce with point of sharp knife.  Place on prepared baking  sheet and bake in preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes. When cool enough to  handle, peel eggplants and remove seeds.  Place in container of food  processor and sprinkle with lemon juice to keep from browning.    2.  Add tahini, garlic, and salt.  Process until smooth.    3.  Spread onto serving platter and pour small amount of olive oil over  top.  Garnish with chopped parsley, paprika, or pomegranate seeds. Serve  with warmed pita bread and crudites.  Cover and store in refrigerator.    Notes:  Baba ghanoush is a traditional dish of Lebanon and Syria, and is  often served with raw or blanced vegetables.  The combined flavors of  eggplant, garlic, and lemon juice are very Mediteranean.  For a smokey  flavor, grill eggplant over hot charcoal instead of baking in the oven.    Variation:  In Greece, olive oil is used instead of tahini.  In Syria  yogurt is added for a lighter tasting dish.  In Turkey it is called Hunkar  Begendi, tahini and garlic are omitted and 1 cup white sauce and 1/3 cup  grated cheese are mixed into the eggplant and heated before serving.
