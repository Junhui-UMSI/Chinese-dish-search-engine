Sweet Darkness
Chocolate malt, cracked, Crystal malt, cracked, Lactose, Citric acid, Black patent, uncracked, Salt, Kent Goldings hops (whole, Yeast nutrient, Yeast, Australian light syrup, Leaf), 
Bring  the  wort to boil (water and syrup to make 3 gallons),  then  add  crystal.  Boil 10 minutes, then add hops. Boil 5 minutes. Turn off  heat  and  add chocolate and black patent malt in a grain bag. Steep about  10  minutes.  Sparge  grain bag with about 2 gallons of boiling  water.  Add  lactose.  Chill and pitch. When fermented, try priming with 3/4  cup  of  light dry malt extract. This is based on Doug Roberts Mackeson Triple  clone.  This  will  be lighter than the real Mackesons with a lighter  head.  Very  similar aromas and head retention. Overall a resounding  success.  One  or  two things Ill do different next time: Reduce black  patent malt to 1/2  cup (crushed), add a bit of dextrin to increase body,  and maybe add a  touch of roasted barley. I recommend this to anyone who  likes  their  coffee strong, with cream and sugar.
