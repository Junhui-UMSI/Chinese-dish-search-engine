This sounds like a dandy brunch item.  Chipotle peppers are *very*  hot, so be warned...    Before you begin preparing everything else, pour boiling water over  chipotle or mora chiles.  Cover and let soak for at least 1 hour. When  chiles are well softened, puree them in a food processor with 1/4 cup  w or chicken broth.    Meanwhile, saute shallots in olive oil until softened.  Then add  flour and cook until lightly brown.  Stir in the herbs and slowly  whisk in the chicken broth.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then add the  cream.    Simmer sauce for 15 minutes or until slightly reduced.  Cream will  thicken. Add 2 teaspoons of the chipotle puree and simmer for 5  minutes longer to concentrate flavors.  If you want more chipotle  flavor, you may add more puree at this point.  Be careful, its  picante.  Taste, and add salt, if necessary.    Poach or lightly fry the eggs.    Cut corn bread into 6 large squares.  Put a square on each plate.  Place cooked eggs on top of corn bread and ladle on about 1/3 cup of  Chipotle Sauce per serving.    These eggs are great accompanied by black beans, turkey sausages and a  fresh fruit compote to cool down the palate.    Serves 6.    NOTE:  Reserve leftover chipotle puree for another recipe.  Or blend  with olive mayonnaise and dash of lime juice and use as a sandwich  spread.
