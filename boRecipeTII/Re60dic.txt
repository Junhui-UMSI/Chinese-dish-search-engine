keema is minced lamb or beef, and it can be cooked with a variety of  vegetables.    Wash and put the mince in a medium size sauce pan with 3 of the onions,  garlic, ginger, and tomatoes. Add all the dry masala. Add a quarter of a  cup of water. Cover with a lid and cook on a slow gas for about 15-20  minutes until the keema is cooked. When all the water has evaporated and  the color of the keema has changed to a pale brown, add the oil and start  to dry roast using a large wooden spoon. Add the tomato puree, coriander  and methi and continue to dry roast until the keema is a golden brown  color. In a large fry pan gently fry the okra and onions until soft (about  4-6 minutes). Add all of this to the keema and mix gently. Put into a  casserole with a lid. Garnish with a spring of coriande. Serve with either  brown rice.
