Heat a heavy, large nonstick skillet over high heat, add  pineapple and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Arrange  pineapple wedges on each pastry round, covering them completely. Sprinkle  each tart with 1 tablespoon sugar. Broil until edges of pineapple begin to  brown, watching carefully, about 5 minutes. To serve, transfer tarts to  large plates, spoon sauce aroun d and garnish with mint sprigs.    >From Taste Show # TS4680    Recipe by: David Rosengarten Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #548 by "Master  Harper Gaellon" <gaellon@inch.com> on Apr 4, 1997
