Goulosh
Onion, Egg noodles, Ground meat (beef), tomatoes in the juice, 
This is one of the easiest recipes I fix and my husband and daughter both  like it. All we ever call it is Goulosh, but everyones Goulosh is  different. But here it is.....    Cook ground meat with onions until done, add tomatoes. Meanwhile boil your  noodles until done. Drain noodles and add ground meat mixure. Stir. Serve  with crusty bread!!!
