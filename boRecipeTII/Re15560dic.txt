7-Layer Salad
Box frozen peas, Red onion cut and diced, Hidden valley ranch dressing, Sour cream, Bag lettuce, Shredded chedder cheese, Bacon; (fried), SAUCE RECIPE, Mayonnaise, Green peppers cut and diced, 
I am not sure if these measurements on the dressing are correct. I will  send the correct amounts tomorrow. Sorry. In a 13" x 9" pan layer it with  the lettuce, then cut the green peppers and layer them next. Next is to cut  the onion and add it, then the box of frozen peas. Fry the bacon till it is  nice and crispy. Crumble it and layer it on the salad. Add the cheese. On  top of all of this you add the sauce. It tastes best when it is cold.
