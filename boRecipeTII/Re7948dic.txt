Cook,turning meat occasionally,until meat is very tender when pierced  with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove meat to a platter and keep warm.    4. Spoon sauce into food processor or blender and puree until smooth.  Season to taste. Return sauce and meat to pot and reheat gently over low  heat. Watch carefully so that sauce does not scorch.    5. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta until tender yet  firm to the bite. Drain well.    6. In large serving bowl, combine the pasta with just enough of the sauce  to coat lightly, reserving the rest of the sauce for the meat. Serve the  pasta with the cheese,if desired,as a first course.    7. Gently reheat the meat and sauce. Slice the meat and serve with the  sauce.
