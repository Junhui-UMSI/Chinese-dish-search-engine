Vegan- Corn Tortillas
Warm water, Salt, Masa harina, 
With a fork, mix the Masa and salt. Add the water slowly until the masa  holds together and the water is absorbed evenly. The tortilla dough will be  moist, but not overly sticky. Divide the dough into 12 balls (about the  size of golf balls). Cover with plastic, as you dont want the dough to dry  out.    To make the tortillas, take a piece of wax paper and fold it in half. Place  a ball of dough in between the wax paper. Squish the ball down using the  bottom of a pie plate (PYREX is best, since you can see whats going on).  When the tortillas is thin, but not too thin, youre done. Do this for all  tortillas, layering them with the used wax paper sheets so they dont dry  out.    Heat a cast iron skillet to _hot_. Tortillas must cook fast else they dry  out. Cook each tortillas, flipping it several times and encoraging steam to  form; if youre lucky or skilled the tortilla will puff up like a baloon.  This should be encouraged by pressing lightly on the tortilla with the  bottom of a spatula while the tortilla is cooking. The steam keeps the  tortillas moist and tender. The tortilla is done when light brown patches  appear on both sides. Place the baked tortillas in a towel-lined basket (or  use the pie plate). Cover with another towel; this steams the tortillas.
