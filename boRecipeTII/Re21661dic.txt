Apple Squares
Butter or margarine, Brown sugar; firmly packed, Salt, Egg, Apples; peeled and finely, Sour cream or yogurt, Baking soda, Vanilla, Chopped nuts (optional), Cinnamon; (1 to 2), Unbleached white flour, Chopped (about 2 apples), 
Preheat oven to 350 deg. F.    In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar and margarine. Blend at low  speed, until the mixture forms fine crumbs. If you want to include them,  stir in the nuts now.    Place 2 3/4 cups of the crumb mixture into an ungreased 13x9 inch pan.  Press down firmly.    Add the remaining ingredients (except for the apples) to the remaining  crumb mixture. Blend well.    Stir the chopped apples into the batter. Spoon the batter evenly over the  crumb base in the pan.    Bake at 350 deg. F for 30-40 minutes. If you use the larger pan, bake for  25-30 minutes.    Cool before cutting. Better yet, let it wait 24 hours before cutting.    Store loosely covered.
