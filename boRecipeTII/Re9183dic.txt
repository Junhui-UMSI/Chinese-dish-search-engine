Cream 1 cup sugar and butter together. Add eggs, salt,  and milk. Add the sponge and beat well. Add flour, a little at a time,  until a dough as soft as can be kneaded is formed. Knead until smooth.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Set in a warm place to rise. When double in bulk  turn onto lightly floured board. Shape into buns. Place on well-oiled  baking sheet. Cover and let rise until treble in bulk. With a knife handle,  make a hole in the center of each bun. Fill with prune preserves or any  sweetened fruit desired.
