Date: Sat, 9 Mar 1996 12:55:37 -0500    From: AKACarl@aol.com  (Carl Shipman)  For us, two joys of the internet are this list and rec.food.sourdough which  has info on all aspects of sourdough and occasionally an offer of free  starter and directions for use from a kind gentleman in Washington state  named Carl Griffith. Using Carl Griffiths starter which I have cycled  through enough feedings so it is really sour, I make FF waffles that are  light as a feather, crispy, and so good we eat the first one without syrup  or anything. The starter is my pet and feeding it has become a hobby.    Evening before: Add one cup flour and 2/3 cup water to existing starter.  Leave at room temp overnight.    Next morning: Preheat waffle baker to WAFFLE temp setting if dial so  marked, otherwise about 2/3 of max temp. When hot, spray lightly with Pam  or equivalent.    Put 1 cup of active bubbly sourdough starter in 2-quart mixing bowl.  In  small bowl, mix 1 Tblsp sugar, 1/2 Tblsp salt, 1/2 Tblsp baking soda.    When ready to cook, sprinkle dry mix on starter and fold in. In a minute or  so, the batter will foam up to about twice the volume.    Ladle into waffle baker. Heat indicator lamp should go on. Cook until lamp  turns off.  Crispness is determined by setting of temp control. Hotter =  crisper.    Makes two full-size waffles. Planning to try these tomorrow morning with FF  sausage gravy prepared using secret recipe (posted to this list several  times heretofore).
