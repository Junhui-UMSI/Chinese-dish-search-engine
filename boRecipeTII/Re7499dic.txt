Well the porch has been making me hungry so figuired I best fire up the Q.  Got Paul Kirks, Championship Barbacue sauce book and some pork ribs  together and made a Rub, Mop and finishing sauce. Had 8 lbs of ribs already  cut individually. Made paul kirks Power Rub and applied to ribs and put in  frige for three hours. Started cooker and kept it at 150 degrees. Put Ribs  in cooker and as Paul says let them cook for awhile as will seal the rub  in. Next I built really my first real mop.    Simmered "A" for 15 minutes and added the following "B" ingredients.    Brought to a boil and then let simmer for 1 1/2 hours Turned up the heat to  230 degrees and moped every half hour for I think 3 hours few beers by  then. So now for my finishing sauce I had maybe half of mop left and added,  1/2 cup honey and a 1/2 cup maple syrup. Turned up heat to 260 degree and  finished moped it a couple times for half hour. My God what a treat, the  only thing I screwed up on is not making some sort of coleslaw, I see now  why I hear coleslaw mentioned on the porch so much, wish I would of had  some. You could just smell and taste the layers of flavor WOW.    Posted to bbq-digest by Don Havranek <phl3871@montana.com> on Feb 15, 1998
