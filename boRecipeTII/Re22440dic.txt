Tuscan Bean Side Dish
Dried white beans, Beet green, Good Sherry, olive oil, White onion, Carrots, , celery, garlic, Sweet, Tomato paste, Italian Sausages, White cabbage, 
1.  The beans are cooked, right? Heat the oil in a  large heavy pan over  low heat. Add onion, garlic     and celery. Cook until tender, just golden  brown. 2. Add the cabbage & greens and cook until wilted. 3. Mix in the  carrots, tomato paste and sherry. 4. Mix in the cooked beans, sausage and  simmer for about      45 minutes. The consistancy should be fairly thick  but still juicy...so people can serve on their plates. Salt & pepper to  taste. Make this the day before. Great with Ham or Turkey.
