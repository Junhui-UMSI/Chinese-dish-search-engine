Add the onions and green  pepper and saute until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the  tomatoes and the seasonings; cover and let simmer over low heat 20-25  minutes. This allows the flavors to blend. Trim all visible fat off the  steak. In a nonstick pan or a pan that has been sprayed with nonstick  cooking spray, lightly brown the steak on each side. Transfer the steak to  a 13=D79 inch baking dish; pour the sauce over the steak and cover. Bake at  350F for 1-1/4 hours or until steak is tender. Remove from oven; slice  steak and arrange on a serving platter. Spoon sauce over the steak and  serve.    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Mar 02, 1998
