Plum Dumplings
Butter or margarine, Flour, Mashed potatoes, Salt, Eggs, Plums, 
Cut the butter into the flour until as fine as cornmeal. Add the mashed  potatoes, eggs, and salt, mixing until smooth. Roll out to 1/4-inch  thickness and cut into 3 to 4-inch squares. Place a plum on each piece and  carefully and completely surround with dough. Gently put a few at a time  into boiling water, not allowing the water to boil too vigorously. Cook  about 15 minutes. Check often while cooking.    These may be steamed instead, if desired.    Serve with melted butter, sugar and cinnamon, or even a little cottage  cheese. Some people like them with buttered and browned bread crumbs.    Note: My mothers favorite way of preparing fruit dumplings would be to  saute them in butter (after they were boiled), and then sprinkle them with  the cinnamon and sugar.
