In a stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the beef in batches  and quickly brown on all sides. Remove the meat and reserve. Add the  carrots, onions, garlic and celery. Saute until the vegetables are lightly  colored. Return the beef to the pot and add the raw beets, tomatoes, stock,  wine, fennel seed and thyme. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer  partially covered for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until the beef is very tender.  Occasionally skim off the fat as the borscht simmers.    Strain the soup carefully, pressing down gently on the meat and vegetables  to extract as much liquid as possible. Set aside the beef cubes and discard  the remaining vegetables, if desired. Return the beef and strained liquid  to the stockpot. (The soup can be made ahead to this point and refrigerated  overnight.) Add the balsamic vinegar and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in  the parsley and keep warm.    In a separate saucepan, in lightly salted boiling water, blanch the  potatoes until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm. In a  medium saute pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the  cabbage and caraway seed. Saute until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.    To serve, ladle the borscht into warm soup bowls. Add the roasted beets,  potatoes and sauteed cabbage. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream.
