Quinoa Loaf
Sesame seeds, Gluten flour, Garlic, Quinoa, fennel, onions, olive oil, Tahini, red bell pepper, pinto beans, celery, Sea salt, Water, Sea salt, Whole wheat flour, 
Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan along with the water and 1/2 teaspoon  salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the water has  evaporated (about 15 minutes). Set aside.    Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the celery, fennel, onions,  garlic, and bell pepper, along with the salt, marjoram, and cardamom, for  about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Add the cooked  quinoa and the sesame seeds, pinto beans, and tahini to the sauteed  vegetables.  Blend the ingredients.    Mix the two flours together and blend into the vegetable and quinoa  mixture. Line a large loaf pan with a baking sheet liner and lightly oil  the liner. (In lieu of the baking sheet liner, you could just oil and flour  the pan.)  Press the mixture into the pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for about  45 minutes.  (The loaf should reach an internal temperature of 180-200  degrees F.)  Let the loaf cool, inverted, for 10 minutes before removing it  from the pan.  Serve the loaf in slices, with your favorite tomato (or  other) sauce if desired.
