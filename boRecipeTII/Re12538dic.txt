Yerushalmi Kugel
Vegetable oil, Thin noodles, Black Pepper, Eggs, Salt, Sugar, 
This is our recipe for Yerushalmi Kugel. We got it from Rabbanit Yehudit  Rabinovitz, the wife of the late Munkatch Rebbie, here in Petach Tikva.    Yerushalmi kugel should be sweet on the outside and peppery on the inside.  A friend of mine whose family comes from Jerusalem (something like 4 or 5  generations) claims that real Yerushalmim eat it with techina and pickles.    Cook noodles until medium done and drain well. Mix in a bowl all  ingredients except sugar.    Brown 4 tablespoons of sugar in a deep pot (You can use an enamel pot. I  use a regular pot and later remove the plastic handles).    Put mixture in pan and bake covered for 1 hour.    Remove from pot and brown 4 more Tablespoons of sugar. Put back mixture  upside down. Leave on the "plata" (blech) overnight.
