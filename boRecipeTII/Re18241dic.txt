Venison Sauces
Sweet Sauce:, White or red wine, Sugar, Champagne vinegar, White or red currant jelly, 
Sharp Sauce:    Sharp Sauce:--A quarter-pound of the best loaf-sugar, or white candy-sugar,  dissolved in a half-pint of Champagne vinegar, and carefully skimmed.    Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of white or  red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly unmelted in a small  sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for hare, fawn, or kid, and for  roast mutton to many tastes.    Gravy for Venison:--Make a pint of gravy of trimmings of venison or shanks  of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is browned, then  stew it slowly. Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it yields, adding salt  and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.    From: The Scots Kitchen with Old-time Recipes Shared By: Pat Stockett
