Combine the first five ingredients. Place chops in a glass baking dish and  pour the marinade over. Cover and refrigerate 3-6 hours or overnight.  Remove chops from marinade and grill or broil 4" from the heat to desired  doneness. Brush occasionally with marinade. NOTE: For best results grill  bone side down(chop standing up not laying flat on grill).    Lifted from the Country Women magazine June 91 issue.
