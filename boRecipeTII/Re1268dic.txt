Dan Gills Turkey Brine
water, Salt, Molasses, Garlic, Onion powder, Black pepper, Lemon juice, Maple flavoring, Ginger ale, 
Alternatively, use: 1/2 tablespoon ginger (ground, or minced) in place of  the garlic and onion.    * Table salt is not recommended because of the iodine. I usually use dairy  salt which is just a good quality sterilized fine salt. I buy it from a  farm supply store in 50 pound bags for curing meat and fish. Kosher salt  works fine too, it just dissolves a little slower.    Cover birds completely with brine and refrigerate overnight. In the  morning, remove from brine and drain while preparing smoker. Rinse birds  well inside and out. Smoke at around 250F (measured at grate level) to an  internal temperature of 170F in the thickest part of the thigh. Basting  with butter every few hours will give you a beautiful golden-brown skin.    Posted to bbq-digest by wight@odc.net on Nov 15, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.
