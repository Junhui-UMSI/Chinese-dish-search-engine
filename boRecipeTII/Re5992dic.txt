Pita Bread 2
Sour dough, Yeast, Whole wheat flour, Flour, Water, Honey, 
I set the ABM for dough, and when ready add flour as needed. then I shape  my circles, I have used a rolling pin, but last time tried, with exit, a  tortilla maker.  Once the "tortillas" are made, you have to leave then  about 1/2 an hour to rise.  Then you put them, flipping them, so the side  that was down is now up, on a cookie tray and into a very hot oven. When  they start inflating you turn them over.    I make my normal bread recipe, that is in the breadmaker I put, more or  less.
