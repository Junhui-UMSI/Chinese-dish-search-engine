Pomelo (Grapefruit) Cream
Cornstarch, Pomelo or grapefruit juice, Sugar, Eggs, 
In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the pomelo or grapefruit juice and  the cornstarch and stir until smooth.    Put the remaining juice in a medium nonaluminum saucepan. Add the sugar,  place over medium heat, and cook, stirring, until the sugar melts. Whisk in  the cornstarch mixture and remove from the heat.    With a whisk, lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl. Whisk the warm juice  into the eggs. Pour the mixture into a 1 1/2-quart  souffle dish and cover  with aluminum foil, pressing the foil around the rim to seal.    Put the souffle dish on the steamer rack, place over simmering water,  cover, and steam until the pudding is set and a knife inserted into the  center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.    Remove the souffle dish from the steamer pot and let cool. Refrigerate  until chilled. Serve cold.
