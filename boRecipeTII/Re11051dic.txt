Notes: By Tillie Labosky, Lansford. The Times News, PA    Red: Dissolve gelatin in hot water. Add cold water. Pour in mold and place  in refrigerator until partly congealed.    WHITE: Dissolve gelatin in hot water. Add cold water and cream cheese. Beat  with egg beater to dissolve cheese completely. Pour over congealed  strawberry gelatin.    GREEN: Dissolve gelatin in hot water. Drain syrup from pineapple and add  enough water to make 1 1/3 cups liquid. Add to gelatin mixture. Place in  refrigerator until partially congealed. When gelatin is of syrup  consistency, fold in pineapple and pour over congealed cream cheese layer.  Refrigerate until ready to serve. Cut into squares to serve. I make mine in  a 9x13 glass baking dish because it makes a lot. Eespecially at Christmas  its so festive looking.    Posted to recipelu-digest by ncanty@juno.com (Nadia I Canty) on Mar 6, 1998
