Thai Choo Chee Shrimp
Basil, Water, Fish sauce, Coconut milk, Red curry paste, Salt, shrimp, Brown sugar, Basil leaves, Long-grain rice, 
Stir the coconut milk and place 1/2 cup in a medium skillet over medium  heat. Bring it to a gentle boil and cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally,  until it thickens a little and releases its fragances. Add the curry paste  and cook 2 minutes, mashing and stirring to dissolve it and mix it into the  coconut milk, water, fish sauce and sugar. Bring to a gentle boil 8 to 10  minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sauce is smooth and  slightly thickened. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with fish sauce,  sugar or salt, if desired. Stir in shrimp and torn basil leaves; cook about  3 minutes or until shrimp curl, turn pink and are cooked through. Remove  from heat and serve over rice. Garnish with basil sprigs. Adapted from "The  Curry Book" by Nancie McDermott. Typed by jazzbel@batelnet.bs.
