Tournament Greens Bloody Mary
Red chile flakes, Quartered lime, Sprigs creasy greens,, Garlic, Shot vodka, Nuoc mam, Worcestershire Sauce, V-8 vegetable juice, or, Stalk celery, 
I call this "Tournament Greens Bloody Mary" because the creasy greens start  to grow big enough to harvest right around the time of the ACC and NCAA  basketball tournaments.    First, combine the nuoc mam, garlic, and chile flakes to make nuoc cham (a  Vietnamese dipping sauce). Take creasy greens, place in food processor, and  finely sliver. Put shot of vodka into a chilled glass, add nuoc cham,  slivered greens, worcestershire sauce, and V-8 or tomato juice. Squeeze  quartered lime slightly into the glass, then place firmly on edge of glass.    If you dont have creasy greens (barbarea verna), substitute cress.    Goes equally well while watching the pit or watching NCAA tournament  basketball. Go Tarheels!
