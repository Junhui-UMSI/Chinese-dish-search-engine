Unsalted butter, TOPPING, Unsalted butter; melted, Smoked salmon; up to 4, Eggs, Unbleached all purpose flour, Minced sweet onion, Fresh dill sprigs, Snipped fresh dill, Black Pepper, Salt, milk, 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place an 8 to 10-inch cast iron skillet or  other heavy skillet with a heatproof handle in the oven.    Combine the eggs, milk, flour, dill, salt and pepper in a bowl and whisk  until smooth. Using a pot holder, remove the skillet from the oven and add  the butter; swirl the pan to melt the butter and coat the skillet. Add the  batter all at once and immediately return the skillet to the oven. Bake  until the pancake puffs up around the edges, 18 to       20    minutes.    Cut the pancake into wedges and drizzle with a little melted butter. Top  each with a slice of smoked salmon and a few dill sprigs. Add a little  minced onion, if using, and serve.
