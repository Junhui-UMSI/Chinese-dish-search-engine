The tortellini in the recipe are the dried ones  that are handy to have on hand for nights when nobody feels like cooking. A  "takje" parsley is one stem; just chop the leaves off.    Recipe By     : Tip    Cook tortellini according to instruction. Drain and keep warm.  Put the  onion, water, bouillon tablet, pepper, thyme and garlic in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil and simmer about 10 minutes, until onion is soft. Stir  flour into yogurt. Add the yogurt mixture into the broth, stirring  constantly.  Cook over low heat, stirring, until sauce has thickened.  Remove pan from fire. Stir in the parsley. Salt and pepper to taste. Divide  the tortellini and sauce between two plates.
