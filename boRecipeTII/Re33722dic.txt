Sweet and Sour Beans
Salt, Green or butter beans, Vinegar, Vegetable oil, Sugar, Plain flour, 
Cook the beans in boiling, lightly salted water to cover. Make a roux (see  recipe for creamed spinach) with the oil and plain flour and add the beans  together with their cooking water, stirring constantly, to make a thickish  sauce (add more water if necessary). Add the vinegar and sugar and stir  until the sugar is dissolved. Taste and adjust if necessary by adding more  vinegar or sugar. Continue cooking, stirring, for a few more minutes.  Serve.
