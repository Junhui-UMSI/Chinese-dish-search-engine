After roasting the veggies, peal off the charred skin (except the habs)  leaving bits of charred skin on the veggies. Next place all of the  ingredients in a blender /food processor except the salt & olive oil. Puree  all until it is smooth. Next heat the olive oil in a saucepan and heat. Add  the sauce and simmer for 5-7 minutes. While simmering stir in the salt.    Note: use a ripe lime- which should be yellow not green.    The sauce should keep in a fridge for 1-2 weeks.  Like I said I just made this last night. I never make a recipe exactly the  same two times in a row... I like to play with my food.. guess I never  really grew up ;-).    Anyway last night I added a shot (+) of Triple sec to the sauce... yummy (  I also used 4 red Savina habs to make it hotter).
