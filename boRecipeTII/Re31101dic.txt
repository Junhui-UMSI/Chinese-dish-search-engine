Banana Softserve
Ripe banana, 
From: IWarfield2@aol.com    Date: Mon, 22 Apr 1996 00:30:02 -0400  Place ripe bananas, 1 per serving, directly into the freezer unpeeled. The  peel will serve as a protection in the freezer. Freeze solid.    Just before serving, peel off the skin with a small paring knife ( a little  trickier than it sounds), cut the banana into chunks & place in a blender  or in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Blend until the banana  breaks up, passes the icy stage & becomes creamy & whipped with air. The  consistency should be that of frozen custard.    Serve immediately.    Notes: Variation: Frozen berries, peaches etc. can be added, but for best  results it should be at least half banana.
