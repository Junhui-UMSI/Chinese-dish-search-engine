Water, Beef suet; ground fine or, Beef; cut in small pieces, Onion; minced, 
In 1918, Walker Austex was producing 45,000 cans of Walkers Red Hot Chile  Con Carne (with beans) and 15,000 cans of Mexene Chili Powder a day in  their new factory in Austin, Texas. But Walker had already been selling  canned Mexican foods for over a quarter century and may have been the first  to can chili. Gebhardts didnt start canning chili (as opposed to making  chili powder) until 1911. Walkers 1918 recipe booklet had recipes for  "chile huevos" and "chili mac" -- plus something called "combination chili  con carne" -- one can chili mixed with one can tomatoes.    Genuine Mexican Chile Con Carne. One pound of beef cut in small pieces; 1/4  lb. beef suet, ground fine (or you can use lard). Add two tablespoons of  Walkers Mexene, one medium sized onion minced; add water and boil until  thoroughly cooked. The gravy from this chili con carne is fine for  macaroni, spaghetti and vegetables. If beans are wanted, use any good red  bean. For instance -- California Bayous, California Pinks or Pinto Beans.  When these are not convenient, use French Red Kidney Beans. Boil the beans  separately and add beans when serving.
