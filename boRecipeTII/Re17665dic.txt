Beat the egg whites in a  deep bowl until stiff; lightly fold in the almonds & sugar & add a few  drops of almond extract. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a  large rosette tube & pipe it onto the baking sheets in small rosetts & S  shapes, leaving about an inch between each. Decorate the petits fours with  candied cherries, strips of angelica, silver shot, nuts, or candied  violets.  Bake in the center of a preheated oven at 350 about 20 minutes,  until golden brown.
