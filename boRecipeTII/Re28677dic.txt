Texas Mopping Sauce for Barbecue
Strong black coffee, Butter or margerine, Sugar, Salt, Worcestershire Sauce, Tomato catsup, Black Pepper, 
Combine all ingredients and simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring  frequently.  Store in a tightly covered jar in refrigerator. Heat before  using.  For ribs, I dunk the ribs in the sauce each time I turn them. This  sauce is very spicy and some people think its too strong for poultry; I  disagree.    The coarser the pepper is ground, the better it is. Warning: if this is  used on country style pork ribs it will make you throw rocks at steak!
