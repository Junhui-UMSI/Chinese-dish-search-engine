Coarsely chop tomatoes and set them aside along, reserving their liquid.    In a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat, cook onions in oil until soft,  about 5 minutes.    Add celery, carrots, garlic, and bell pepper; saute 5 minutes longer or  until vegetables are soft.    Add chili powder and cook an additional 2-3 minutes. Add tomato paste,  beans, sherry, stock, tomatoes with reserved liquid, cumin, and oregano.  Bring mixture to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.    Adjust seasoning with sugar and salt. Stir in cilantro and cook 10 minutes  more, uncovered.    Pattyes notes: We had this for dinner tonight and my entire family  (including a 5 year old and a 7 year old plus an 8 year old friend)  declared it the best dinner ever. I served it over brown rice with some  wheat berry bread.
