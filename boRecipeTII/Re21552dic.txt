In slowcooker, combine the above ingredients.  Cover and cook on low 5 or 6  hours or until pork is tender. (I have had to let this cook as long as 11  hours before - still turns out great...) Turn pot on high.  In a measuring  cup, combine 2 Tbs. cornstarch and 2 Tbs. cold water.  Stir into pork  mixture.  Cover and cook until thick.  Serve over rice and pass around  peanuts, coconut, raisins, and chutney as condiments.
