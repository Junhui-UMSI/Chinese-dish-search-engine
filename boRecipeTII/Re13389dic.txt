Yankee Pot Roast
Onions; chunks, Beef broth, Round or eye roast, Celery; cut up, Carrots; cut up, 
We use a round or eye roast. Place it in the slow crock pot. Throw in one  can of beef broth (removed from the can). Next add cut up carrots, celery  and chunks of onions. Cook all day.    When done you have two choices: the first is to serve the sliced roast with  with the veggies as a side dish, the second option yields a wonderful  gravy. Heres how you do it. Place the cooked veggies and some of the gravy  from the pot in a blender. Puree the mixture and serve.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "M. Hicks" <nitro_ii@email.msn.com> on Feb 7,  1998
