Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine flour with 1/2 cup of the sugar and  the baking powder. Cut 1/4 cup of the butter into pieces, and add to the  flour mixture. Stir in the milk until the batter is smooth; set aside.  Place the remaining butter in a 9-inch square or 10-inch round baking dish.  Place in the oven until the butter melts, 5 to 6 minutes. Swirl the butter  over the bottom and sides, then pour the batter evenly into the dish.  Arrange the peach slices, slightly overlapping, on top of the batter, in  rows if the dish is square, in circles if it is round. Combine the  remaining sugar with the cinnamon; sprinkle over the peaches. Place the  dish on a baking sheet, and bake until golden brown, about 45 minutes.  Serve warm, with whipped cream or ice cream.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #827 by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on  Oct 05, 1997
