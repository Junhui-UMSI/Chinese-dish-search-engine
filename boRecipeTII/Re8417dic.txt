Potato Sourdough Starter
Potato, Dry yeast, water, Sugar, Flour, 
Here is a recipe from Texas Highways Cookbook.    Dissolve yeast in warm water; and then mix all ingredients in a 1-gallon  crock.  (Do not use metal container) Cover with a close-fitting lid and let  the starter rise until light (12 hours in warm weather, longer in cool  weather). Do not let the starter get cold, ever. After using part of the  starter, add 1 cup warm water, 2 teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to mix  to the starters original consistency.  Add more potato occasionally as  food for the yeast, but dont add more yeast. Use daily for best results.  Starter improves with age. I am sure you will get some posts for flake  starters.  I do not have one.
