Kansas City is the sauce capital of the country, where they practically  pave the streets with the stuff. Over tha last half-century, local  pitmasters perfected a spicy, sweet sauce, thick with tomatoes, that  ultimately became the most common and popular style nationally. When you  look for a commercial sauce in a supermarket today, Kansas City-style may  be the only kind you find. Few of the packaged products, however, rival the  originals, still served in Bar-B-Q joints all over town, or good homemade  variations on the same theme. This version is modeled on the sauce that  Ollie Gates created years ago for this thriving small chain of Gates &  Sons restaurants. Like Gatess classic, our rendition will leave you  strutting with satisfaction.    In a saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and  saute until they are softened, about 5 minutes. Mix in the remaining  ingredients, reduce the heat to low, and cook the mixture until it  thickens, approximately 30 minutes. Stir frequently. If the consistency is  thicker than you prefer, add a little water. Use the sauce warm or chilled.  It keeps, refrigerated, for a couple of weeks.
