* according to this book, chipotle puree is chipotles in adobo sauce that  has been pureed. Go figure...    Drain the beans and rinse them well. Place them in a large saucepan with  the cold water, bay leaf, and whole sage leaves. Bring to a boil, reduce  the heat, and cook, uncovered, at a gentle boil until tender, abt. 30  minutes. Remove the herbs and set the beans aside.    Meanwhile, cover the chilies [sic] with the hot water, soak for about 20  minutes, and puree in a blender. Heat the oil in a large skillet; add the  onions, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon of the cumin. Saute over medium  heat until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for 1 to 2  minutes more.    Add the beans and their broth to the onion along with 1/2 teaspoon salt,  the remaining cumin, and the chili [sic] purees. Cook over medium heat for  20 to 25 minutes, stirring as needed. The beans should be saucy and soft  but not mushy. If they need more liquid, add a little water. Add the  chopped sage and salt to taste.    NOTES : Sez to use ancho chiles if New Mexican aint available.  Serve with  enchiladas or quesadillas or simply with warm tortillas.  Recipe by: frm.
