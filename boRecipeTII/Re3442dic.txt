Pecan Cinnamon Buns
Chopped walnuts or pecans, milk, Brown sugar, Yeast, Vegetable oil, Sugar, Salt, Eggs, Sugar, Lukewarm water, Flour, Light karo syrup, 
Put yeast and 1 tbl sugar and water in a large bowl. Set aside. Scald the  milk, take off heat.  Add oil, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and cool to lukewarm.   In a separate bowl, mix eggs and milk mixture.  Slowly add flour. Knead  lightly, place in a lightly greased bowl and let rise until double in size.  Punch down, take about 1/3 of the dough and roll to about 1/4" thick.  Spread with the following...   Melted butter, sprinkle with white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon. Roll  dough and cut about 1" thick.  Put in *Prepared Pans* (directions to  follow).  Cover and let rise until double in size. Bake at 350 for 25-30  minutes.  Let stand for about 1 minute, loosen rolls from the sides of the  pan and turn out on wax paper to cool. (at least to cool enough so you can  pick them up to eat cause they are best when warm.)   ***** Prepared pans:  Lightly grease bottom and sides of pan. Put a thin  layer of brown sugar on bottom, chopped walnuts or pecans also. Lightly  drizzle melted butter over the sugar and nuts, then lightly drizzle white  karo syrup over the mixture.  If you add too much brown sugar, butter and  syrup all the "sticky" will run off when cooling. You have to experiment a  little to see how much to add to your liking.
