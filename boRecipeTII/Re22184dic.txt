Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a  chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over peelings &  parings into a stock pot and fill with water. Add garlic cloves. Fill the  stock pot with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and let  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3. Remove from heat to cool cover  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another  large pot. Return the broth to the stock pot. Go through the collander and  remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard. Next, go through the turkey  remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any left  over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to the  pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place  over heat and bring to a boil. While youre waiting, cook the egg noodles  per package directions and drain. Simmer the soup just long enough to cook  the carrots. Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy. Adjust  seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to heat  noodles and serve.    Makes a bunch!
