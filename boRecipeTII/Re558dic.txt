Frightfully Easy Ghost Cookies
Vanilla-Flavored Candy, Nutter Butter Cookies, Miniature Chocolate Chips, 
1. In small saucepan, melt candy coating over low heat, stirring constantly  until smooth. 2. Line cookie sheets with waxed paper. Holding cookies with  tongs, dip entire top and side of each cookie into melted coating, letting  excess drip off. Lay flat, coated side up, on waxed paper-lined cookie  sheets. Place two chocolate chips in coating to form eyes. Let stand 10  minutes until set.         32    cookies    NOTES : I use white chocolate chips in place of the vanilla candy =  coating.  It works great.    Recipe by: Pillsbury Classic Cookies and Bars    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by candi@mcmsys.com (Candi) on Sep 08, 1998,
