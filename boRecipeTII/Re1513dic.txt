Brining Liquid for Turkey
Brown sugar, Maple syrup, Kosher salt, Garlic powder, Bay Leaves, Ginger, Black pepper, Cloves, Soy sauce, Allspice, Dried thyme, Water, 
Heres one I used last year with GREAT results:    This recipe is enough for a 12-to 14-pound turkey. The spicing is very  faint, mostly you taste the salt and a bit of the sugar. Its a bit like a  very elegant version of commercial smoked turkey, only without the smoke.  Double the recipe for a 24-28 lb turkey. Check your containers (crock)  volume.    Combine spices in saucepan. Add 1 quart water and bring to boil. Simmer 5  minutes, then add to remining 2 quarts of cold water. Chill thoroughly  before using brine.    Makes 3 quarts (enough for 12- to 14-pound turkey).    Brine for 2 to 4 days, turning the bird twice a day.    Cook turkey 12 minutes per pound:    450 degrees for 30 minutes, then,    375 degrees for remainder of time.
