Basic Cream Puffs
Sugar, Eggs, All-purpose flour, Margarine, Water, Salt, 
1. Heat water, butter, sugar and salt to a full rolling boil in large  saucepan.    2. Add flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until mixture  forms a thick, smooth ball that leaves the sides of pan clean, about 1  minute. Remove from heat.    3. Add eggs, one at a time, beating hard after each addition with wooden  spoon or electric hand mixer,until paste is shiny and smooth. Shape and  bake following your  recipe instructions for making the puffs and filling  with a creamy filling of your choice. Usually the recipes will call for  baking at 375 degrees until puff is delicately browned and there are no  beads of moisture left on puff. Test by taking a puff out of the oven and  if it does not fall it is done.    posted to recipelu 1-10-98 by Sarah Gruenwald    Contributor:  Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 0:40    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 490 by P&S Gruenwald  <sitm@ne.infi.net> on Jan 10, 1998
