Cut cake lengthwise into 1-inch-thirds. Cut cake  lengthwise into 1-inch-wide slices. Set aside.    For Filling: Mix thawed frozen raspberries and 3 tablespoons sugar in large  bowl. Set aside.    Using handheld mixer, beat egg yolks and remaining 3/4 cup sugar in large  metal bowl until well blended. Beat in 1 cup dry Marsala. Place bowl over  saucepan of simmering water (do not let bottom of bowl touch water). Beat  until mixture triples in volume and registers 160 degrees on thermometer,  about 6 minutes. Remove bowl from over ater. Cool yolk mixture to room  temperature, whisking occasionally.    Arrange enough cake slices in 12-cup trifle dish to cover bottom. Spoon 1  cup of raspberry mixture over cake, allowing some to show at sides of bowl.  Pour 1-1/2 cups filling over. Arrange enough cake slices over filling to  cover completely. Spread remaining raspberry mixture over. Pour remaining  filling over; smooth top. Cover and refrigerate trifle at least 4 hours or  overnight.
