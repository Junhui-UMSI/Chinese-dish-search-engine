from: Susanna Foo Chinese Cuisine, makes 50-60 dimplings       Heat the oil over high heat in a large saucepan. when hot, add the  spinach and immediately cover the pan. Low the heat to medium and cook for  2 minutes or until wilted. Remove the spinach from the pan and drain off  any excess liquid. when cool, chop finely and set aside.       In a large bowl, mix the veal, shallots, soy sauce, sesame oil,  scallions, basil or cilantro leaves and gingerroot, add the chopped  spinach.       Place about 2 teaspoons of the stuffing in the center of each wrapper.  Moisten the edges with cold water, then fold them over the filling to form  a half moon or half circle shape. Pinch together the edges with your  fingers. The moisten the 2 ends with water and bring them together in a  circle around the filling and the dumpling can be made in advance and  frozen, tightly sealed for up to 3 months.         Cook only the dumplings you intend to serve. Feeze the rest for  later use. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add about one-third of the  dumplings at a time, and cook until they rise to the surface and float. The  filling will still be raw. Add 1/2 cup cold water and return to a boil  again. When the dumplings float, taste one to see if it is done. If not,  add another 1/2 cup cold water and cook until the dumplings rise again.  Adding cold water slows the cooking so the dough does not break, allowing  enough time for the filling to be throughly cooked. (Sometimes I cook the  meat first in the microwave, Its cheating, but then I am in a hurry)        Remove the dumplings from the water with a strainer or slotted spoon,  drain and place 6 dumplings on each serving plate. Heat the Ancho Chili  Sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat for 3-4 minutes or until warm.  Pour 3 tablespoons over each serving. Serve any remaining sauce on the  side. Deocrate with Julienned basil leaves, Sichuan preserved vegetables  and fried Shallots if desired. Serve warm.    Note: Sichuan preserve vegetables are availanle in cans in many Asian  markets. Drain, rinse and saok them in cold water for 5 minutes. chop and  soak again in boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain and store in a jar in the  fridge for up to 1 week.
