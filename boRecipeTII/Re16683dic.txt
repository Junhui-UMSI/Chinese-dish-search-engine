Pre-heat oven to 375 F, 190 C, Gas mark 5.    Drain the can of salmon. Flake the fish. Mix with the cheese, onions and  red pepper. Set aside. Put the flour into a bowl, add the eggs, salt and  basil. Mix well to form a soft dough. Divide into egg size pieces. Knead  until smooth.    Roll the dough pieces on a lightly floured board to a maximum 2mm / 1/10  inch thick or roll each piece through a pasta maker reducing the setting to  5 or 6 over 3 or 4 rollings. Cut the pasta sheets into 3cm / 1 1/2 inch  squares. Put salmon filling onto one corner of each square then fold in  half diagonally to make a triangular "pattie". Dry on silicone paper for 1  hour before cooking, turning each pattie over after 30 minutes to dry  undersides.    Put the soup into a casserole dish and drop the salmon patties into it.  Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle  with the cheese. Continue cooking for a further 10 minutes. Serve with  salad.    Serves 4.
