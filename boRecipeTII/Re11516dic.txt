Sugar, * see note, Raspberries, Lemon juice, Egg yolks, Unsalted butter, 
* if the berries are not sweet enough    Puree the raspberries, combine them with the lemon juice and sugar, if  needed. Place in saucepan, simmer about 5 minutes, and strain through a  mesh sieve.    Place the strained raspberries in a blender or food processor. Melt the  butter in a saucepan until it is just bubbly. With the machine running,  slowly drizzle in the butter. Return the mixture to a saucepan. In a mixing  bowl, beat the egg yolks. Add 3 or 4 tablespoons of the raspberry mixture  to the egg yolks and blend well. Pour the egg yolk and raspberry mixture  into the saucepan with the rest of the raspberry mixture. Over very low  heat, stir until the mixture thickens, about 10 or 15 minutes. Cool and  refrigerate.    Raspberry curd will keep up to 10 days in the refrigerator. Makes about 1  pint.
