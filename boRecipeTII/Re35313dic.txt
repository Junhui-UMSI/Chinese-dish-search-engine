Preheat oven to 325F.  Saute bacon in heavy large Dutch oven over high heat  until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon  to paper towels. Season beef generously with salt and pepper; coat with 1/3  cup flour, using all of the flour. Working in 3 batches, brown beef in same  pot over high heat, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer meat to large bowl.  Add onions and carrots to same pot and saute until light brown, about 6  minutes. Add garlic and saute 1 minute. Transfer vegetables to bowl with  beef.    Add 1 cup broth and Cognac to pot; boil until reduced to glaze, scraping up  browned bits, about 8 minutes. Return meat and vegetables and their juices  to pot. Add wine, mushrooms, thyme, sugar, tomato paste and 2 cups broth.  Bring to boil, stirring occasionally. Cover pot and place in oven. Cook  until beef is tender, about 1 hour 20 minutes.    Ladle liquid from stew into large saucepan.  Spoon off fat. Boil liquid  until reduced to 2 3/4 cups, about 40 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.  Pour liquid back over beef and vegetables. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead.  Cover and chill.) Rewarm over low heat before serving.    From the Burgundy & Lyonnais region of France    Bon Appetit/May 94 Typed by Didi Pahl
