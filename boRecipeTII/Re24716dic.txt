Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Saute th epotatoes, onions, broccoli  and garlic for a few minutes. Add the seasonings and continue cooking for a  few minutes, stirring constantly.Finally, add the soysage and tofu and cook  until the mixture is hot, stirring constantly.    Roll out half of the dough and prepare the bottom crust for each of two  small pies. Put 3 cups of filling in each pie pan. Roll out the top crusts  and place them over the pies. Seal the edges of the top and bottom crusts,  wetting the edges first with water. Bake in apreheated oven at 400 degrees  for 40 mintues or until th etop crusts are browned. When the pie has baked  for about 30 minutes, you can glaze the top crust with amixture of 1/4 cup  barley malt syrup and 2 tbs water. Just lightly glaze the crust and return  the pie to the oven. The glaze will make the crust shiny and brown.    Variation:  You may prefer to add a bread crumb topping to the pie instead  of a top crust. Prepare the topping by lightly mixing 1/2 cup whole wheat  bread crumbs and 1/4 cup oil. Sprinkle it over the pie filling and bake the  pie acording to the recipe.    Source: Friendly Foods by Bro.
