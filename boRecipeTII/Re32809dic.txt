Salt, Green Onions/Tops; Sliced, Red Chiles; Ground, Sweet Potatoes, Diced, Raw, Bacon; Slices, Cut Up, Eggs; Large, Beaten, 
Heat enough salted water to cover the sweet potatoes, (1/4 Tsp of salt to 1  cup of water) to boiling.  Add the potatoes and cover.  Heat to boiling  again and then reduce the heat.  Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 6  minutes and drain.  Cook the bacon in a 10-inch skillet until crisp, remove  and drain on paper towels.  Drain the excess fat from the skillet reserving  1 Tbls in the skillet.  Stir in the potatoes and cook over medium heat,  stirring frequently, until golden brown.  Mix the eggs, ground red chiles  and salt.  Pour the mixture into the skillet.  Sprinkle the mixture with  the bacon and onions.  As mixture begins to set on the bottom and sides,  raise it so that the uncooked egg mixture flows underneath the cooked. Cook  until the eggs are cooked all the way through but still moist, about 3 to 5  minutes.    Miscellaneous recipes from the collection of Mike Orchekowski.
