Remove  bones from the pork; cut and pound the pork into 3 to 4 inch cutlets no  more than 1/4" thick. Press the pork into the crumbs to coat. Let cutlets  chill a bit and rest i the refrigerator (helps the crumbs stick without egg  or mayo). Juice 1 small orange. Grate or zest the rind. Heat the oil and  butter together. Fry the pork; about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Add other  ingredients to the skillet, reduce heat to moderate and ad other  ingredients to the skillet. Simmer about 4 to 5 minutes to reduce the  sauce.  Serves 2 to 3 people.    Tastes really good with Basmati rice (1/2 cup per person) and chopped  broccoli side dishes.  Also good with zucchini and carrot julienne.
