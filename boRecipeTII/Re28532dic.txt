Dip and chips -- yum!  This is a bit thicker than a dip.  Easy to make in  quantity for a big party or to pack in small glass containers for gifts.  Must be refrigerated.    Place beans in bowl and partially mash until chunky.  Set aside.    Heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and  garlic; saute 4 minutes or until tender.  Add beans, tomato, and next 3  ingredients; cook 5 minutes, or until thickened, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat; add cheese and remaining ingredients, stirring until  cheese melts.  Serve warm or at room temperature, with fat-free corn or  flour tortilla chips or cut-up veggies.    Makes about 2-1/2 cups.  Recipe may be multiplied.    When made with reduced-fat cheese: 1 tb = 21 cal, 1.3 gm fat.    Presented by Anne Steirer at a "Healthy Holiday Gifts" seminar on Oct. 24,  1995.    Sylvias comments: she served this on Baked Tostitos and it was quite good,  not dry-tasting.
