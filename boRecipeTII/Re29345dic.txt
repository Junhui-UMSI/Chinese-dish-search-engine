Baked Tomatoes Stuffed with Orzo
Granulated sugar, Salt, Black pepper, Orzo, Dried oregano, Parmesan cheese, Onion, Tomatoes, Chicken broth, Butter, Mozzarella cheese, 
Remove the center pulp and seeds from the tomatoes, hollowing them out  well. Lightly sprinkle into each tomato a little sugar, salt, pepper and  oregano; place four cubes of mozzarella in each tomato.    Preheat oven to 400-degrees.    Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the onion in it until soft; stir in  the orzo, stirring well so each grain of pasta is coated. Pour in 2 cups of  the chicken broth, stir well, and simmer until it is absorbed, adding more  broth gradually until the orzo is about three quarters cooked; firmer than  al dente (I cooked mine longer--dont like pasta that firm). Taste it as  you go and cook until its as firm as you like. Blend in the Parmesan,  stirring it in well.    Spoon the orzo mixture into the hollowed tomatoes, filling them. Place the  filled tomatoes in a casserole or baking dish with 1/2 cup of hot broth in  the bottom of the dish.    Bake, covered, for 15 minutes; remove the cover and cook an additional 10  minutes.
