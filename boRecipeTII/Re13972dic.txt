Winstons Fire
Black Pepper, Salt, Thyme, fresh ginger, Habs, White vinegar, Onion, 
I have a good one for you...straight from trenchtown <Jamaica>, I have a  few cooks from there who swear by this fiery recipe...    Blend all, and keep in the fridge, its raw and fiery, depending on the  sweetness of the habs or bonnets used.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #176 by ChefChile@aol.com on Oct 28, 1997
