Raspberry Viniagrette 7
Water or stock, Vegetable oil, Raspberry vinegar, Salt, Sugar, 
I used a bit of sugar because my husband does not like it tart. The water  or stock thins it down a little bit. Makes it very very light and quite  lovely served over fresh tender lettuce. This was a particularly nice  dressing. One I need to keep and remember. Sometimes the simplest ones are  the best.
