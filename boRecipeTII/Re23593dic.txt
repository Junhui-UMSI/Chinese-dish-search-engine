Place a layer  of crumbled crackers on the bottom, and moisten with some of the  water/oyster liquid. Top with a layer of oysters, placing the oysters in  the dish one, by one. Repeat with a layer of crackers, oysters and  crackers.    Mix together the remainder of the ingredients, excluding the margarine,  cheese and paprika, and pour over the top. Dot the margarine on the top and  place in refrigerator overnight or at least 2 hours.    One hour before serving, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and paprika and bake  for about an hour at 375 degrees; the time may vary depending on the depth  of the egg/oyster mixture. Let stand on counter for 10 - 15 minutes before  taking to table.    Serves 4 to 6.    Recipe by: Art Guyer    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by Art Guyer <Beach_Bum@usa.net> on Nov 26,  1997
