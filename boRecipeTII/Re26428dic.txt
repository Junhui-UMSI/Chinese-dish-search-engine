PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if large,  into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if theyre scarred, and  cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave some of the core so  that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes into large, neat pieces.  Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to taste and the potatoes, and  boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes, but save the water. While the  potatoes are cooking, warm the olive oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the  leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay  leaves. Cook slowly over medium heat until the onions have begun to soften,  after 6 or 7 minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately  half, then add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the  parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water to  cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can set the  stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top of the stove.  If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook slowly until the  vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking in the oven, preheat it  to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1 hour, or until done. Remove bay  leaves. Garnish with the remaining parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic  mayonnaise.    DEBORAH MADISON - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK
