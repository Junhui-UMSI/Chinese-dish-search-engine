Waffled Sweet Potato Chips
Sweet potato, Vegetable for deep-frying, 
Peel the sweet potato. Adjust the fluted blade of a mandoline to 1/4-inch  and with the mandoline slice the sweet potato, turning it a quarter turn  after each slice to produce a waffle pattern (If you dont have a  mandoline, just slice the sweet potato crosswise, about 1/8-inch in  thickness.) In a deep skillet heat 1-inch of the oil over moderately high  heat to 375 degrees F. on a deep-fat thermometer, in it fry the slices in  batches, turning them, for 1 minute, or until they are golden, and transfer  the chips as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.    The chips may be made 1 day in advance and kept in an airtight container.  Just before serving arrange the chips in one layer in shallow baking pans  and heat them in a preheated 400 degrees F. oven for 5 minutes. Sprinkle  the chips with salt to taste and serve them warm. Makes 2 servings.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 582 by QueenBerta  <QueenBerta@aol.com> on Jan 23, 1998
