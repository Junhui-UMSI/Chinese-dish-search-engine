The Most Incredible Chocolate Pudding And/or Dipping Sauce
Milk chocolate chips, Heavy/whipping cream, 
Combine chocolate and cream in medium saucepan; melt and stir over  medium-low heat until smooth. Remove from heat. (At this point you may stir  in 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, or 1  tablespoon brady or liqueur, if desired.) For a pudding, refrigerate at  least 2-3 hours or overnight. (This pudding is so deliciously rich that you  should plan to serve it alongside a treadmill or rowing machine!) As a  dipping sauce, immediately serve while still warm with whole strawberries,  chunks of fruit and/or cake to dip into the chocolate. Makes 1/2 cup.
