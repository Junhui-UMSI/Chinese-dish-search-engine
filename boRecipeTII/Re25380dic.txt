Bring 6 quarts of water to boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.    In a mixing bowl, stir together ricotta, parsley, Parmigiano, nutmeg and  eggs until well blended. Roll out pasta to thinnest setting and cut into  6-inch squares. Place 2 tablespoons ricotta mixture in the center of each  square.

Continue until all  pasta is done. Drop tortelloni into boiling water and cook until tender,  about 8 to 9 minutes.
