Pumpkin Pie 5
Cream, *pastry, Whiskey, Sugar, Egg, Cinnamon, Pumpkin, cooked, Butter, Cornstarch, 
Take a large pumpkin, wash, cut in half and place, cut side down, in pan in  warm oven. Roast until soft, but not mushy. Scrape out the flesh of the  pumpkin with a spoon or fork. Place into colander and let drain over night  in a cool place. The next morning, put 2 cups of the pumpkin in a bowl and  whip thoroughly with a fork until all lumps disappear, but avoid mashing.  Drain out as much liquid as possible, because the pumpkin should be dry.  Add the sugar, yolks of eggs, cinnamon and beat for 5 minutes. Quickly add  the cream, the whiskey and the butter, and mix well. Sprinkle the  cornstarch over the stiffly beaten whites of eggs and add to the first  mixture. Pour into a pan about 2 1/2 inches deep which has been lined with  pie pastry, and bake for one hour at 375-F. Allow pie to become cold before  using.
