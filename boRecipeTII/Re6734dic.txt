Polish Noodle Casserole
White pepper, Powdered mustard, onion, Sour cream, noodles, cooked, Cottage cheese, Salt, 
INSTRUCTIONS Place: Cooked and drained noodles in a buttered 1 quart  casserole dish. Mix: Sour cream, cottage cheese, minced onion, salt,  powdered mustard, and white ground pepper. Mix the above with the noodles  in the casserole dish.  Bake  in a preheated 350 F. oven for 25 minutes.  (The noodles on  top should begin to brown.) To be a bit more fancy, when  the 25 minutes is over, pull  the casserole out of the oven, smear it with  a bit of butter,  and allow it to cook another 5 to 10 minutes. To be even  more fancy, sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top of the butter before  putting the casserole back into the oven.
