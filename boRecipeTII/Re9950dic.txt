Peel squash: cut into large chunks, removing and discarding all seeds and  fibers. Put broth into large saucepan or soup pot and add the squash  pieces. Bring to a boil over high heat; then lower heat, cover. and simmer  20 to 25 minutes, or until squash is very tender. Meanwhile, melt the  margarine in a large skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat; then saute  the onion until it is tender but not browned. Add the apples and saute  until they are tender. In batches, using a blender or food processor,  (fitted with the steel blade), process the apples, onion and cooked squash  with just enough of the squash broth so the mixture can be easily pureed.  (Reserve the remaining broth.)    Stir the pureed mixture back into the pot containing the reserved broth. If  the soup is too thick, stir in additional broth as desired. (The soup may  be made ahead to this point.) Shortly before serving, reheat the soup,  stirring often. Season with salt, if desired.
