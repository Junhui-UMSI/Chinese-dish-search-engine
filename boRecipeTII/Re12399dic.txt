Heres the one I like out of New Recipes from Moosewood Restaurant:    Place the bulgar in a bowl and pour the boiling water over it. Cover and  set it aside until it has absorbed the water and become soft and chewable.    Saute the onions and garlic in the oil until the onions are just  translucent. Add the zucchini, dired herbs, and black pepper and continue  to saute on medium to low heat until the zucchini is tender, but not  falling apart.    In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Mix in the feta and cottage cheese. Add  the chopped parsley, tomato paste, and soy sauce to the bulgar and mix  well.    Assemble the casserole in an oiled 9 x 9 casserole dish. Layer first the  bulgur mixture, next the suateed vegetables, and then the feta mixture. Top  the casserole with grated cheddar cheese, tomato slices, and a light  sprinkling of sesame seeds.    Bake covered at 350 for 45 minutes. For crustier cheese, uncover the  casserole for the final 15 minutes of baking. This casserole can be more  easily served after it sits for 5 to 10 minutes.
