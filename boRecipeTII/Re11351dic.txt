Sift the cornmeal, salt and soda together into a large mixing bowl.  Add  milk, eggs, oil, rice, corn, onion, chile and  cheese and mix together  gently. Pour mixture into a 12 inch cake tin or ovenproof frying pan which  has been greased and sprinkled with cornmeal. Cook in a preheated moderate  oven (180 c / 350f / gas 4) for 40 to 45 minutes.    This "bread" always goes down well at parties or picnics and I tend to vary  the hotness according to who is going to eat it  (whispers - Ive even been  known to use green sweet peppers instead of the chiles but only for  decidedly non chile-head company). I mostly use the standard UK supermarket  chiles (variety unknown but cone shaped, 2 - 3 inches long, up to 1inch  wide at stalk end ,fairly thick fleshed, medium hotness)    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #276    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
