Pour la Frances Fudge Caramel Cake
Brown Sugar, Cashews, layers of choc Cake, Light corn syrup, Heavy cream, Salt, Fudge Icing, Caramel Sauce, Heavy cream, Semisweet Chocolate, Butter, 
FOR CAKE:     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to  make 4 round cake layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and  top with Fudge Icing, Caramel Sauce and Cashews.  Repeat with next 2 cake layers. Place final cake layer  on top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing  and cover sides of cake with chopped cashews. FUDGE  ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in chocolate until  melted and smooth. This will be very soft but will  harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable  consistency. NOTE: The time it takes to get to a  workable consistency depends on the weather. This is  much like making fudge candy. The author, (Arlene  Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and  had no problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4  ingredients to boil and reduce to thick syrup. Very  carefully, (because it will splatter), add cream.  Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny  Mattingsley, of Pour la France, 7959 Broadway, San  Antonio, Texas......
