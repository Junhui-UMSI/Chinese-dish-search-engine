Almond Brunch Loaf
Active dry yeast, Sugar, Sugar, Orange juice, Almond cake & pastry filling, Egg, Toasted almonds; chopped, Orange juice, Butter, Salt, Bread flour, Orange peel; grated, 
Add 1/2 cup orange juice, egg, butter, salt, bread flour, sugar and yeast  to a bread machine according to manufacturers directions. Select dough  cycle. When dough cycle is complete, remove dough from machine. Cover and  let rest for 10 minutes.    On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 24" x 8" rectangle.  In a  small mixing bowl, stir together the almond filling, almonds, and orange  peel.  Spread filling over dough to within 1/2" of the edges.  Fold dough  loosely from a short side, making about eight 3" wide folds.  (This is  similar to making a jelly roll, except you make folds 3" wide, instead of  rolling it.)  Transfer to a lightly greased baking sheet.  On one of the  long sides, make eleven 2 1/2" cuts from the edge toward the center at  about 3/4" intervals. Flip every other strip of dough over to the alternate  side. Slightly twist each strip, exposing the filling. (The loaf will look  braided when you are done flipping and twisting!)    Bake in a 350 oven for 25 to 30 minutes of until golden brown.  If  necessary, cover loosely with foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes to  prevent overbrowning. Lightly brush the bread surface with orange juice.  Sprinkle with sugar. Serve warm.
