Shape into mold and turn out onto baking pan.  (You can do this with any meatloaf: very pretty and easy to slice).    Combine the catsup, brown sugar and prepared mustard. Brush mixture onto  loaf.  Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven for 40 minutes, brushing with  catsup mixture once more during baking.    Remove loaf from oven and arrange Jack cheese slices over loaf. Bake about  5 minutes longer until cheese melts. Slide onto serving plate. Fill center  with Poppy Seed Noodles. POPPY SEED NOODLES: Cook the noodles according to  directions on the package, or until tender. Drain well. Toss with butter,  half-and-half and Jack cheese. Sprinkle on the poppy seeds and toss well to  mix.
