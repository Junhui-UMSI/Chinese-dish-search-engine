Fresh green pepper, Beef roast, Red pepper, Garlic, Roasting pan drippings, Fresh oregano, Chopped, dried Oregano, Fresh sweet basil,, dried basil, Fresh parsley, Salt, Whole black peppercorns, 
Thinly slice cooked, roast beef and place in a Dutch oven (or put it back  into the same pan in which the beef was roasted). Add enough water to  cover. Add remaining ingredients and bring to simmer. After the beef has  cooked for awhile, taste and adjust seasonings. Cook about 1 hour. Serve  beef only on Italian bread with grilled green peppers and / or giardinera  relish.  As you serve dip the sandwich in your gravy.    NOTE: If you fix a large roast for dinner, take the leftovers, sliced  thinly, and put your Italian Beef on the stove to cook, while youre  cleaning up the kitchen. You can cook the Italian Beef in the same pan used  for roasting. IF you make brown gravy for your roast beef, remove some of  the drippings before you make the gravy and save them for the Italian Beef.
