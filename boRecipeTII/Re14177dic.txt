1. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour 2 9-inch cake pans. 2. Make the  Cake: In a double boiler, melt the white chocolate over hot, not simmering,  water. Set aside to cool slightly. 3. In a large bowl with an electric  mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating  well after each addition. On low speed, add the melted chocolate and the  vanilla. In three additions, on low speed, alternately beat in the flour  mixture and the milk. Beat until just smooth, about 20 seconds. 4. Pour the  batter into the prepared pans and bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until the top  is golden and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Set the  cake pans on a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes. Then invert the cakes onto  the racks to cool completely. 5. Prepare the Filling and Frosting: Place  the white chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small heavy saucepan, bring 1  1/2 cups of the cream and the butter to a simmer. Pour over the chocolate.  Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. Refrigerate the  white chocolate mixture until firm enough to spread, about 1 hour. 6. To  Assemble: Spread the bottom layer with 1 cup of the chilled white chocolate  mixture. Arrange the chopped macadamia nuts over the filling, and top with  the second cake layer. 7. In a medium bowl, beat the remaining 1 cup cream  until firm peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the remaining white  chocolate mixture. Spread this over the top and sides of the cake. Arrange  whole macadamia nuts around the rim and base of the cake. Chill until ready  to serve. Garnish each piece with a fanned strawberry or raspberries.
