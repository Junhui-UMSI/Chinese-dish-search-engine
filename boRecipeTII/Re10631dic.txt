Salt, Finely Chopped Fresh Parsley, Cloves Garlic, Peel, Mince, White Pepper, Finely Ground, Olive Oil, **Note, Nonstick cooking spray, White Potatoes, *Note, 
Adapted from Healthy Side Dishes    *NOTE: Small, waxy white-fleshed potatoes, peeled and cut crosswise into  1/4" thick slices (I left the skins on) **NOTE: Original recipe used 2 T  olive oil.    Preheat oven to 400 deg F. Lightly coat a 9" round baking dish with  nonstick cooking spray.    In a bowl, combine potato slices, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Toss  to coat well. Using a slotted spoon to remove them from the bowl, arrange  potato slices in rows in a circular pattern in baking dish, starting at  outer edge of dish and overlapping slices a little. Pour any of the oil  mixture remaining in bowl over potatoes.    Lightly coat a piece of aluminum foil with nonstick cooking spray and lay  it, sprayed-side down, over potatoes. Place another baking dish of the same  size on the foil, bottom-side down, and press firmly.    Bake 40 min. Remove top dish and foil. Continue to bake about 15 - 20 min  longer, until potatoes are tender, browned and crispy.    To serve, sprinkle parsley over the top.
