Potato Skins
olive oil, Paprika to taste, Potatoes, 
Preheat oven to 450F. Scrub potatoes well (leave the skin ON). Cut  them lengthwise into six wedges (like dill pickle spears or sections  of an orange). In a large bowl, toss potato spears with the olive oil  until they are well covered. Spread potatoes on a baking sheet and  dust with paprika. I stand them on the skin edge. Bake for 20-30  minutes or until fork-tender.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
