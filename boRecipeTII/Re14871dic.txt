Second place went to Nancy Rullo, of Bloomingdale, for her recipe for  Moms sugar cookies in the shape of Santa Claus faces, iced with a cream  cheese frosting and decorated in traditional holiday colors. The recipe,  Rullo wrote, was one that her mother had found in her mothers first  cookbook. As children, Rullo and her brother would help cut out the Santa  Claus shapes and watch them bake. from the Chicago Tribune third annual  Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 13, 1990  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 01:06:56 +0000
