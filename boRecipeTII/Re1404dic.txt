Score the cucumbers with the tines of a fork, and cut them in half  lengthwise. Remove the seeds - a grapefruit spoon or melon baller works  well. Sprinkle the cucumbers with salt, and let them stand for about 1/2  hour. Then rinse, pat dry, and slice the cucumbers into 1/2 inch chunks.    3. In a medium serving bowl, crush the feta with a fork and mix it with the  scallions, lemon juice, oil, and pepper.    4. Combine the cucumber chunks with the cheese mixture. Sprinkle the salad  with the mint. It can sit in the refrigerator before serving, but try not  to hold it more than an hour or so or it will get watery.
