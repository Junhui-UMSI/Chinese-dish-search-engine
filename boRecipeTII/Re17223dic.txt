Voodoo Punch
Orange juice, Dark Caribbean rum, Pineapple juice, Lemon slices, Packed light brown sugar, fresh ginger, Peppercorns, whole, Cinnamon, Water, Vodka, Flowers, Allspice, whole, ice, 
Peel ginger and slice thinly.  In a 1-quart saucepan, combine brown sugar,  ginger, peppercorns, allspice, cinnamon sticks and water. Bring to boil;  then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Strain, discarding  spices; chill.  If made ahead, set aside until ready to use. To prepare  punch for serving place ice block (should be 2 quarts) in punch bowl. Add  chilled syrup, rum, vodka, orange juice and pineapple juice. Taste and add  more juices, if desired. Poke stem of each flower through the center of a  lemon slice; float slices atop punch.  Serve each drink over ice cubes.    A few notes:  I find this recipe a little sweet, so I add the juice of a  lemon or two before serving.  The flowers that the recipe suggests are  daisies or hibiscus. It then suggests "other flowers" but this is something  to be really careful about, since the first time I served this punch some  idiot decided to try the flowers! (takes all kinds). This is a really good  for a hot summer night (yes we do get them in Canada) - very potent punch.
