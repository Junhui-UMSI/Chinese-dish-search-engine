Boil 2 cups of the water and pour it over the Shiitake and fungus and any  ever other dried mushrooms you may have chosen. Let this sit in a bowl for  30 minutes. When the mushrooms have finished soaking, squeeze the juice out  of them and cut them into bit sized pieces; do not use the stems.  Pour the  soaking juice into a large soup pan with 5 1/2 cups of water.  Bring the  water and all the mushrooms EXCEPT the enoki mushrooms to a boil.    Add rice wine or sherry, soy sauce and vinegar.  Reduce the heat and allow  mixture to simmer for at least 10 minutes. (If  youre trying to get other  dishes to come out at the same time, this is a good place to just let the  mixture simmer till youre ready for it!)    Mix the cornstarch and the remaining 1/2 cup of cool water in a cup.  Wisk  the mixture into the hot soup... this is the possible lump stage, but with  all the mushrooms and egg whites, who will know?).    Drizzle the egg whites into the soup, whisking or stirring constantly. Add  the white pepper.    Wait 2-3 minutes and then dish up the soup, garnishing each bowl with  scallions and enoki mushrooms.  (These last add a lot of flavor!)    Posted by sally charette ~~ltECZ5SCC~~at;MVS.OAC.UCLA.EDU> to the Fatfree Digest  [Volume 15 Issue 11] Feb. 11, 1995.
