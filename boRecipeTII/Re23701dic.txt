Artichoke Preparing for Cooking Whole
Globe artichokes, Baby artichokes, 
Rinse artichokes. Cut off the tip of each large leaf with a scissors, so  you wont be pricked by the sharp tips when youre eating the leaves. Then  with a knife, cut off the top inch or so of the artichoke. Cut off stems if  you want; you can pare them and cook them in the pot alongside the  artichoke.    Baby artichokes, of l/2-inch diameter or less, do not need trimming.    Cook immediately after trimming to avoid discoloration. Lemon may be used.    After trimming artichokes wash your hands well; they tend to give your  fingers a bitter taste and will affect the next food you pick up and eat.
