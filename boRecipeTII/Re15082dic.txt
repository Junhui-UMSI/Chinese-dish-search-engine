Combine dry ingredients in mixing bowl. In a separate bowl add the beaten  eggs and all the remaining ingredients, blending well. Add the two mixtures  together and stir only until moistened. Use a heavy cast iron skillet if  available; if not, use a 9-inch square baking dish. Grease the skillet or  dish, pour in the mixture and bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for 30-35  minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly and serve immediately.
