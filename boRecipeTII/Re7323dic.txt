Pork Chops Braised in Milk
All-purpose flour, Boneless loin pork chops, Pepper, Margarine, Salt, 2% low-fat milk, 
Trim fat from chops.    Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a large zip-top plastic bag. Add chops;  seal bag, and shake to coat chops with flour mixture. Remove chops from  bag, reserving the remaining flour mixture. Place the flour mixture in a  small bowl. Gradually add 1/2 cup milk, stirring with a wire whisk until  blended.    Melt margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chops; cook 3  minutes on each side or until browned. Add milk mixture; cover, reduce heat  to low, and cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Turn the chops over. Add remaining 1 cup milk; cover and cook 30 minutes,  stirring occasionally.    Uncover skillet, and cook the chops an additional 15 minutes or until the  liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup (the sauce will be very thick). Yield: 4  servings.
