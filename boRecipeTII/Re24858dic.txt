Aunties Kulolo
Poi, Sugar, Honey, Ti leaves, Coconut milk, 
Mix all in a big bowl. Line a loaf pan with foil and then the ti leaves.  Pour in. Cover the top with foil so will not form a crust. Bake 2 hours at  400 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove foil last half hour. Cool, slice and enjoy.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 495 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Jan 11, 1998
