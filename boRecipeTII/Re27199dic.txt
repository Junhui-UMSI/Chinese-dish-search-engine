In a large heavy skillet, melt 2 tb. of the butter. Add onion, mushrooms  and parsley; saute until softened. Remove from pan. Add the other 2 tb. of  butter to the pan and heat until sizzling.  Add orzo and stir constantly  until golden brown.  Return onion mushroom mixture to pan. Add chicken  broth and wine. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer 10 to 15  minutes, until orzo is tender but still moist.    While orzo is cooking, steam peas just until barely tender. Add thyme and  toss with pasta just before serving. Add salt and pepper to taste and  sprinkle with Parmesan.    Recipe developed by Renee Shepherd and Fran Raboff.
