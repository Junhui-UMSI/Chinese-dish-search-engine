(about 3 green onions), Fresh mint leaves, Bulgur; dry, Green Onions, Water; boiling, Fresh parsley, Garbanzo beans, cooked, Lemon juice, Tomato; chopped, Garlic powder, 
Recipe by: McDougall Put the bulgur in a small mixing bowl. Pour the  boiling water over the bulgur. Mix. Cover with a towel and let stand for 1  hour. After 1 hour the excess water should be removed. The easiest way to  do this is to pour the bulgur and water into a fine mesh strainer. Let the  water drain off, pressing the bulgur with your hands to remove as much of  the excess water as possible. Place the drained bulgur in a bowl. Add the  remaining ingredients. Toss well to mix. Cover and refrigerate at least 2  hours to blend flavors.    HELPFUL HINTS: This is a great make-ahead dish, easy to take to a pot-luck  dinner or picnic. Try it stuffed in pita bread for a different sandwich  idea. This recipe can be doubled or quadrupled easily for larger amounts.  Keeps well in regrigerator.
