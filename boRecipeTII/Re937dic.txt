Hungarian Goulash
Beef; (e.g. shank), Onions, Paprika; (sweet and/or hot),, Red wine, Salt; pepper, Shortening; (lard or neutral, Smoked bacon rind; (skin), Dry or fresh chilies to, 
Cut meat into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Cut onion into thin rings. Check wine for  flavor by tasting. This is important, so check more than once. The wine  should be full-bodies and dry, neiher sour nor sweet. If it isnt, use  water instead. In a large casserole, heat the oil or lard and saute onions  until transparent. Add beef cubes in portions. Saute them until golden  brown, stirring almost constantly. Add paprika. Immediately afterward the  paprika add 1-2 glasses of wine, stir. Add enough water to cover and salt  to taste. Add bacon rind and chillies (e.g. Hungarian cherry) to taste and  cover. Taste from time to time; if smokey flavor starts to predomeinate,  remove bacon rind. Cook until done and the liquid is reduced; if there is  not enough liquid left, add water, stock or wine. Add pepper and adjust  salt before serving. Serve with pasta (gnocchi = spaetzle, etc.), potatoes  or crusty white bread, beer or the wine used in cooking (if thers any  left).    Other kinds of meat (poultry, game, pork, veal, lamb or even horsemeat) can  be prepared the same way. Add more water and vegetables (carrots, parsnips)  and it becomes a soup.    This is the basic recipe used in my family for three generations. People  who have suggested thickening the sauce with flour were instantly declared  persona non grata. Czechs and Germans add marjoram and caraway seeds, even  garlic. Do so at your own peril.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by "Dr. Anna BUCSICS" <bucsics@ping.at> on Oct  04, 1998,
