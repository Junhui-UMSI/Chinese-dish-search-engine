Griddle Flat Bread
Flour, Shortening, Salt, Baking Powder, baking soda, Ice water, 
Mix all ingredients together to form a dough. Cut into 4 or 5 pieces. Roll  out thin to about an 8" circle. Prick top with a fork and bake in a hot  oiled griddle or skillet. Turn with a spatula, being careful not to burn as  it cooks fast. Very good to eat with sauteed greens such as escarole. This  recipe makes about 4 or 5 8" to 10" Piadinas.
