Pizza Bianca (Simple Crispy Pizza)
Salt, Fresh rosemary, Garlic, olive oil, pizza dough, 
Roll out each pizza dough round on a lightly floured board with a rooling  pin, until it forms a 12" circle, 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Turn dough over as  you roll to prevent shrinkage. Place each piece on an oiled baking sheet or  pizza pan.  Dimple the dough & brush with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt,  garlic & rosemary. Preheat oven to 425F. Bake until the crusts are golden &  crispy, about 20 to 25 minutes.
