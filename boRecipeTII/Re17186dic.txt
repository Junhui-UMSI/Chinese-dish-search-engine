Vlf Chex Mix
Garlic powder to taste, Tiger Sauce or Hot Sauce;, Fat free pretzels; (up to 3), Fat free margarine melted, Fat free Italian salad, Soy sauce or to taste; (up, Rice chex, Wheat chex, Cheerios, 
Mix together the dry ingredients in large bowl. Melt together margarine,  dressing on low heat (may look weird since it wont melt like normal fat  containing margarine, but let it go a few minutes than use a whisk to mix  it and its fine). Add Tiger sauce, soy, and garlic powder. Stir and turn  off heat allowing to cool for a few minutes.    In the meantime, heat up your oven to 250 degrees and spray two cookie  sheets lightly with a garlic or butter flavored spray (Spray is optional)    Drizzle slowly (a little bit at a time) the liquid mixture over the dry  mixture. Stir, drizzle some more, etc. I really take my time mixing so that  I dont make anything soggy, and everything gets well coated.    Spread in a single layer on baking sheets and bake 75 minutes. Every 20  minutes I open the oven, stir the mix a little and close it back up.  Sometimes I reverse which oven racks the pans are on.    When done, shut off the oven and open the door slightly. I leave the pans  in the oven to cool and continue drying. Store in an airtight container.    The cheerios remind me of peanuts--hard and crunchy (They shrink).
