Penne Alla Bettola
penne pasta, Hot red pepper flakes, Vodka, Italian plum tomatos  , double cream, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, parsley, fresh garlic, Sea salt, 
In an unheated frypan large enough to hold the pasta later on, combine the  oil, garlic, crushed red peppers, and a pinch of salt, stirring to coat  with the oil. Cook over moderate heat just until garlic turns golden but  does not brown - 2-3 mins. Add tomatoes and crush them. Stir to blend and  simmer uncovered until the sauce begins to thicken, about 15 mins. Taste  for seasoning.    Meanwhile cook pasta in normal fashion until al dente.    Add the drained pasta to the tomato sauce, toss, add the vodka, toss again,  then add the cream and toss. Cover, reduce the heat to low and let rest for  1-2 mins so that the pasta can absorb the sauce. Add the parsley and toss  again.    Traditionally cheese is not served with this dish.    I add slices of a salami type sausage to this recipe. from Patricia Wells  Trattoria    Posted to Kitmailbox Digest  by "Kim" <kreese@paradise.net> on Mar 12, 1997
