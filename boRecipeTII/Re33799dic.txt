Shape into balls about  the size of a walnut, place on a cookie sheet (or other pan large enough to  hold all of them) and broil untill brown on one side then turn over and  brown other side. Mix sauce ingredients together and heat in a sauce pan  (large enough to hold the meat balls too) add meatballs and simmer for 30  minutes. Serve over rice.    Notes: you can also fry the meatballs in a pan if you dont care about the  added fat. If so then just add the sauce to the pan with the meatballs.
