For Bread Machine:  Put the ingredients into the pan in the order given.  Select white bread. Choose high crust setting. Push Start. This is a very  moist cake-like bread, and one of our favorites. Makes 1 loaf. Scratch  Method: Combine whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the Better for bread flour,  yeast and Caraway seed. Heat the water, molasses, brown sugar, shortening  and salt, just till warm, stirring to melt the shortening. Add to the dry  mix.  In an electric mixer, beat at low speed for 30 seconds, then on high  speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff  dough. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Shape in a ball and let  rise in a greased bowl, until doubled. I speed up the rising by placing the  bowl of dough in the overn with the light turned on. Punch the dough down  and divide in half.   Shape in 2 loaves. Let rise on a greased baking sheet, until double. Bake  at 375 degrees 30 to 35 minutes. If you like the crust really chew, brush  the bread with warm water during the last 10 to 15 minutes of the baking.  Remove from the sheet and cool on racks. Makes 2 loaves I have made this  bread for many years. It is almost like eating cake! My husband said he  couldnt tell the difference between when I made this from scratch, and  making it in the bread machine.
