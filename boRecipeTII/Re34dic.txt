Add the olives and pine nuts just before the last  1/2 cup flour if your hand kneading or using mixer or 5 minutes before the  end of the bread machine cycle ( to keep them whole ).   Let dough double in  size about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and spread in a cornmeal, heavily dusted  14 inch round pizza pan.   Make indentations in the dough with your finger  tips, cover and let rise for 45 minutes or doubled and puffy. Push  vegetables of your choice into dough to keep them anchored down.   Meanwhile  preheat oven to 500. turn it down to 450 and bake foccacia 15 to 20 minutes  or until golden brown.   Remove from oven and sprinkle with fresh basil and  cracked black pepper. Fresh tomato slices, chopped garlic and a bit of  olive oil elevate this bread to sublime.
