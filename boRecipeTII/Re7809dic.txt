dry white wine, bread, coriander leaves, Tomatoes, Salt, Piri-piri sauce, Nutmeg, Ground allspice, olive oil, Onions, Garlic, Green pepper, Fish, 
This is a real fishermans stew, dependent on whatever the boats have  brought in.  The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese  identity.    Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many bones as  possible.  Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while you make the  following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan and stir in the  onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they start to soften, then  put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a  little water. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then remove  from the heat. Lightly oil the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish  (preferably earthenware). Put in a layer of fish followed by a layer of  sauce and sprinkle with coriander. Continue with these layers until the  ingredients are used up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well  with the remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated  oven at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender.  Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to make a  substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves, you can use  fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of the dish.
