Prepare pasta. Rinse and drain; set aside.    Prepare broth: Bring kombu and water to a boil. Remove pan from heat, add  bonito flakes, cover and allow flakes to sink to the bottom. Remove kombu  and discard flakes. (Reserve kombu to cook with other dishes.) Add tamari  and mirin and lightly simmer for 1 minute. Squeeze in juice from the grated  ginger. Place noodles in bowls and pour hot broth to cover. Top with green  onions. Make it simple, garnished with EDEN Nori, or more complex by  topping with vegetables, tofu or tempura!
