Place the goose on a flat work surface and remove all loose fat. Sprinkle  the cavity with 1 teaspoon salt; set aside. Prepare the herbed bread  stuffing according to package directions, using 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup  brandy and butter. Once the stuffing is thoroughly moistened, stir in the  tangerines, celery, prunes and raisins; stir well to distribute the fruit  evenly. spoon the mixture into the body cavity, using up any remaining to  fill in the neck cavity. Close both ends of the goose with skewers and  place in a pan. Pierce the skin of the goose all over with the tines of a  fork. Rub the skin all over lightly with vegetable oil before, not during,  barbecuing. Rub the remaining salt on the skin. Set a drip pan in the  center of the coals. Place the goose on a rack directly over the pan. Using  a medium-slow wood or charcoal fire, cooking time will be between 2 3/4 to  3 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the goose, and the heat of the fire.  The goose is done when the joints move freely. Remove the goose from the  grill and set on a platter to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and  serving.
