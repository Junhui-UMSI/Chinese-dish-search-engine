Valeries Baked Apple Pancake
Granny Smith apples, Brown sugar, cinnamon, All-purpose flour, Eggs, cinnamon, milk, Nutmeg, Salt, 
Ok, here is the Apple Pancake recipe that Ive come up with, borrowing from  various other recipes. It is very similar to The Original Pancake House  Apple Pancake. I grew up in Portland Oregon, where the first OPH started,  and when I moved away, I missed having this pancake so much I was  determined to recreate it! :-)    Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Beat together eggs, milk, flour, salt, 1/2  tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon until smooth. Add apples to batter. Melt  butter in 10-inch cast iron skillet (if you dont have cast iron, use what  you have, but heavier works better). When very hot, pour in batter. Remove  from heat and *quickly* sprinkle a handful of brown sugar over the top, to  taste. I like to make sure every spot gets some sugar. Then sprinkle some  more cinnamon over the top and put in teh oven. After 15 minutes, lower  heat to 350 degrees and bake for 10 more minutes.    ALTERNATE METHOD: Use the full 1 1/2 T. of butter, and before you pour the  batter in the pan, sprinkle the handful (I have small hands, so I use a  couple handfuls... if you like it less sweet, use less) of brown sugar over  the bottom of the pan, with a sprinkle of cinnamon, then *gently* pour the  batter in and cook as above. Keep an eye on it to make sure you dont burn  it (both methods).    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 426 by "Valerie Whittle"  <catspaw@inetnow.net> on Dec 30, 1997
