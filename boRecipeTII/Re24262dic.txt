Tricolor Roasted Beet Salad with Dill
Shallots, White beets, White balsamic vinegar, Red beets, Black pepper, olive oil, Coarse salt, Gold beets, Fresh dill leaves, Sour cream, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Trim the greens from the beets and save for  sauteing or use in a soup. Scrub well, trim ends, then place beets on a  baking sheet. Roast until cooked through, about 1/2 to one hour depending  on the size. Allow to cool, then remove the skins (they should slip off  with your fingers). Cut beets into 1/2inch wedges and place in a medium  bowl. To make the vinaigrette, whisk the remaining ingredients together in  a small bowl. Drizzle vinaigrette over beets and toss to combine. Serve on  plates with a dollop of sour cream.
