Gradually add sugars; beat until fluffy and  smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each. Add sifted flour and  salt and mix well. Stir in chocolate chips and vanilla. Spread in buttered  9" square pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, or till nicely  browned in center (darker brown around edges). Cool in pan on cooling rack.  Cut into squares.
