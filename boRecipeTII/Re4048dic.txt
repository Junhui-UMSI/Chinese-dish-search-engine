Peppermint Ice Cream #1
Cool Whip, "Starlight Mints", Liquid; non-fat dry milk, Chocolate syrup, 
Combine mints and milk in a large plastic container; let stand overnight in  refrigerator. Next day, add Cool Whip; mix well. Leave in the same  container and place in the freezer. Stir well, particularly from bottom, 4  or 5 times during the first 2 hours of freezing, so that it will completely  mix. (The peppermint has a tendency to stay on the bottom unless stirred  frequently.) Serve as is or topped with chocolate syrup. Makes about 1-1/2  quarts.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.
