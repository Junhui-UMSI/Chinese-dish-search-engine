Polenta, Tomato and Pesto Casserole
Grated Parmesan cheese, Tomatoes, Unsalted butter, milk, Mozzarella cheese, yellow cornmeal, Salt, basil pesto, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 7-by-ll-inch or 2-1/2-quart  casserole.    Combine milk, butter, sugar and salt in a heavy saucepan and heat just to a  simmer. Slowly add cornmeal in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Lower  the heat and continue stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture has  thickened and leaves the sides of the pan, about 10 minutes. Remove from  heat and stir in Parmesan cheese.    Immediately pour half the cornmeal mixture (polenta) into prepared pan.  Work quickly before polenta hardens and is difficult to spread. Top with  half of the pesto, spread evenly over surface. Sprinkle lightly with about  a third of the mozzarella. Top with tomato slices.    If polenta has cooled and is too thick to spread, whisk in a little hot  milk. Pour remaining polenta over tomato layer. Spread polenta with a knife  to reach edges of pan. Cover polenta surface with remaining pesto and  sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.    Bake for 30 minutes, until bubbling. Or refrigerate, covered, overnight and  bake for 40 minutes at 375F degrees when ready to serve. Place casserole  under the broiler for a few minutes to brown top. Let stand 20 minutes  before serving. Makes 12 servings.
