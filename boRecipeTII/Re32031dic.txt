Barbecued Beef
Pepper, Vegetable oil, Worcestershire Sauce, Brown sugar, Garlic; minced, Onions; chopped, Paprika, Water, Liquid smoke, Salt, Beef top round steak; cut, Bay leaf, Tarragon Vinegar, Ketchup, Oregano, Chili powder, 
Combine ingredients in slow cooker; cover.  Cook on  low for 4 to 6 hours, depending on how well done you  want meat. Remove bay leaf before serving. Serve by  itself or on rolls. To save time, use meat that has  been cut up for stir fry. If youre cutting your own,  its easier if the meat is slightly frozen when you  slice it.
