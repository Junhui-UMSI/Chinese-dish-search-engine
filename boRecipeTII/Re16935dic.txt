Add just enough water to cover the  apricots, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook 10 minutes. Drain well and  coarsely chop and set aside.    Blend 1 cup flour with granulated sugar. Cut in butter until crumbly. (I do  this in a food processor --pulse a few times and thats it. Be careful not  to over process.) Add 1/2 cup almonds and stir or pulse a few times to mix.  Pat into an UNGREASED 9 inch square pan. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.    Beat eggs and brown sugar. Add extracts, peel, lemon juice baking powder  and the remaining 1/3 cup flour and stir to blend. Stir in chopped apricots  Pour over partially baked crust. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup almonds.  Bake for 25 minutes more. Cool in pan on a rack. Cut into squares.
