This is a recipe that I picked up  from Mom and made it my own after experimenting for a few years. I never  write it down, and my friends really like this chili version because it is  different. When someone asks for the recipe, I do give it to them, but they  always complain that it doesnt taste the same as the stuff I made them.  Thats because I always tweak the seasonings before serving, and so it  cant be really measured. I try to, but it changes all the time. What we  are after here, is a sweet cinnamon taste with an earthy chili flavor.    In a large heavy bottomed pot, brown the turkey meat in the olive oil on  medium high heat. Add the next six items in the ingredient list to the  browned meat and stir over low heat for a few minutes. Add the garlic,  onion and and celery, and cook on medium heat until celery is soft and  onion is transparant, use a little more olive oil if neccessary. Stir in  the kidney beans and tomatoes and simmer covered for about 30 minutes on  low heat or until kidney beans are soft. Check if seasonings are in balance  with each other ( not too sweet or too spicey). Serve over hot rice. Serves  about 8-10 people. Note: sometimes I use nutmeg or mace. It becomes a whole  different chili, with a sweet undertone. I am not hoarding a secret,  honest, I just dont measure very well.    EAT-L DIGEST 18 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
