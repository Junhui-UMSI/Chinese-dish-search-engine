4 pounds tri-tip or bottom sirloin, trimmed and cut in 1/4 inch cubes.    1) Combine all dry ingredients in a small container. Clean tomatoes of  seeds and put through sieve or chop finely. Combine tomatoes, broth water  and dry spices in a bowl, mix well. Put into a chilli pot and simmer.    2) Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onions and garlic in a little water over  low heat for 30 minutes. Drain and add to tomato sauce and simmer 30  minutes.    3) In a large skillet, cook meat until no longer pink, drain off juices and  add to chilli pot. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until meat is tender. Adjust  seasoning with salt and add Tabasco if hotter chilli is desired.    Cooking time - 3 hours or longer (start to finish)    All typos are my fault. Burning the meat is your fault.
