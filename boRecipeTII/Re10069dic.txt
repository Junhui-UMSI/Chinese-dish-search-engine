Bake on unglazed tile or a pizza stone on the bottom rack of oven to make  it nice and crusty. Or bake it in a greased bread pan.    Mix all ingredients and knead, adding flour until dough is no longer  sticky. Let rise until doubled in volume. Punch out bubbles and form loaf,  let rise until doubled in volume. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 30-40  minutes or however long it takes to brown nicely all over. I lined a small  Corning dish with a dish towel and let the bread rise in it. I took it out  by lifting it out by the towel edges, transferred it to one hand and  quickly put it on the stone right side up.
