Currant-Glazed Prime Rib of Beef
Boneless beef rib-eye roast, Garlic, Dry mustard, Salt, Black pepper, Red currant jelly, 
Preheat oven to 350F.  Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil and coat with  nonstick cooking spray. Place roast in the pan.    In a small bowl, combine garlic, mustard, salt and black pepper; mix well  and rub over meat. Roast 1 hour. Brush currant jelly over the meat and  roast 20 to 30 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted into the  center registers 150F for medium-rare, or until desired doneness. Transfer  meat to a cutting board and allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before carving  across the grain.  TIP: Try this beef with currant sauce. Melt 1/2 cup red  currant jelly in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in 1/2 cup  dry red wine, 1 tablespoon cornstarch and 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard. Bring  to a boil and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly thickened, stirring  constantly.  Yield: 6 - 8 servings.
