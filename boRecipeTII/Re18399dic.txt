Decrease heat to medium-low and simmer (covered) until rice is tender,  about 45 minutes.  Drain well and let cool.    In a large bowl, combine cooled rice, figs, pecans, cashews, green onion  tops, celery and red onion.    In blender or food processor, combine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, mustard  and sugar.  With machine running, slowly add vegetable and olive oils.  Drizzle over rice mixture, season with salt and pepper to taste, and toss  to combine.
