Aioli Sauce - Garlic Mayonaise
Lemon juice, Egg, Garlic, Olive oil, 
Crush the garlic in a food blender. Add the egg, and blend for 15 seconds.  Very slowly add the oil through the top of the blender so that an emulsion  can take place. Stir in the lemon juice by hand. Hint: To get the smell of  garlic off your hands, simply rub your hands in used coffee grinds. End of  odor. In Italy, it is common to eat a whole coffee bean after a big meal so  that your lover will not be bothered by garlic.
