Here the oysters are small and plump  with a great taste. A lot of people, Thais as well, are squemish about  eating raw (and alive!!) oysters so here is a tasty recipie for Thai Oyster  Fondue.    Now, I have to say that your ordinary fondue-set cant be used, the stock  has to be hot, boiling, an Asian steam-boat is what you should invest in,  otherwise use a hot-plate and your imagination.    Stock: Put everything in a pot and simmer for 1/2 hour.    The chile sauce: Mix everything in a bowl, then , if you are many, use  serving bowls.    Open the oysters, discard any that smells, is not alive, etc. etc.    Dip in the boiling stock, not to long, then dip in the chile sauce.  When  you have devoured the oysters, serve the stock as a soup.    As a side dish try these Prawn Cakes (see recipe).    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #286    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
