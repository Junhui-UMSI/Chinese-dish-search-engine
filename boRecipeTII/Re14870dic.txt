Preparation time: 45 minutes Cooking time: 10 to 12 minutes     1. Cream butter and confectioners sugar in large mixer bowl until light  and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks. Beat in flour and 1 c ground nuts until  mixed. (Dough can be refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly  before shaping cookies.)     2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.      3. For topping, beat egg whites lightly with fork in shallow dish until  frothy. Mix 1 cup nuts and granulated sugar in separate shallow dish.     4. Roll a generous teaspoon of the dough in the palm of your hands into a  crescent shape. Dip top of crescent in egg white and then into nut-sugar  mixture. Place crescents on baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake until  bottoms are golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on pan a few minutes, then  transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Sprinkle lightly with  confectioners sugar before serving.     This winning recipe is from Mila Tomisek of Chicago. She prefers to use  unsalted butter, but says margarine can be substituted. The cookies are  very fragile.   Mila first began baking these small, buttery,  crescent-shaped cookies with her grandmother during World War I; today, at  82, she still bakes them for her children and grandchildren. from the  Chicago Tribune third annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 13,  1990  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 01:06:56 +0000
