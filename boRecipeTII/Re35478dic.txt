Beef Jerky #1
Rump roast (or similar cut), Ground red pepper, Black Pepper, Clove garlic; smashed, Worchestershire sauce, Water, Light Japanese soy sauce; I, Ground ginger, White vinegar, Onion powder, 
have the butcher cut your roast in 1/8 inch slice against the grain. OR do  it at home. if you dont have good cutlery, have the butcher do it. it  wont be worth it!    cut off the slice of fat on the bottom. separate the two distinct sinews.  (you can tell, the grain goes one way on one, and the other way on the  other). Trim out the "gristle" that is between them. slice the two sinews  against the grain into 1/8 inch slices.    Mix the soya, and remaining ingredients to make the marinade. Marinade the  meat slices for 6 or 8 hours in the fridge. (I usually place in a ziploc  type bag, and place in a bowl--turning a couple of times to be sure all the  slices get an equal chance at the marinade)    Note: I use the smoke very spareingly, Ive used as much as a 1/4 teas. (10  drops) in this recipe. Any more is too much IMHO. But you might use more if  you really like smoke, but a little goes a long way. I prefer Japanese  soya, cuz its lighter than the Chinese soya. And I get the Light Japanese  soya, which has significantly less salt. You could add more red pepper if  you like it spicey or use fresh ginger instead of bottled. If you like it  sweeter, replace the water with a cup of Vermont maple syrup. Also when  choosing your roast, the leaner, the better.
