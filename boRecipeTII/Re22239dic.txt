Preheat oven to 425F.    Heat the butter in a dutch oven over medium heat and saute the onion,  celery, and garlic for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and mix well. Add the  broth, sugar, pepper, rosemary, bay leaves, and parsley; bring to a boil,  stirring constantly. Stir in turkey; heat for 10-25 min.    Meanwhile, prepare the dumplings. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt  together. Cut in the butter until well blended. Combine the egg, rosemary,  and milk, and add all at once to the dry mixture; blend quickly with a  fork, just enough to moisten.    Remove the bay leaves from stew. Bring to a boil on top of the stove. Shape  dough with your hands into sixteen dumplings and drop onto boiling stew.  Return to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Add the peas, [tuck  them in under the dumplings as best you can,] cover, and cook       10    minutes longer.  NOTES : Serves 4-6. Tasty. Original was with enkele kip filets.
