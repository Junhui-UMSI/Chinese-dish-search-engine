Here are a couple of recipes from the Kitchen Link E-Newsletter that  contain our favorite item. With a little doctoring the heat level could be  kicked up a few notches to meet our normal (?) standards. Hope you enjoy  them.    Heres my best recipe for Tom Yum Soup. It was given to me by my cooking  teacher, Somphon Nabnian at the Chiang Mai Cooking School in Chiang Mai (a  northern city and very beautiful!) Somphon is a fabulous teacher.. . if you  ever get that way, do look him up. here goes . . .    Put the peelings in a pan with the water and bring to the boil. strain the  stock, discarding the peelings.    Bring the stock back to a boil and add the lemon grass, lime leaves,  shallots, garlic, tomatoes, and ginger and bring to the boil. add the  mushrooms and bring back to the boil and add the chilies and the fish  sauce. cook 2 minutes, add the shrimp and reheat to boiling.    When the shrimp are cooked, turn off heat and stir in lemon juice. serve  garnished with coriander.    * If you do not have shrimp, use chicken stock and add chicken. also can be  made with pork cubes, mixed seafood, or tofu (this is really good) if you  use chicken or pork, add the meat before the mushrooms and cook thoroughly.  *if you dont want it too spicy, reduce the # of chilies, or leave them  whole    To be quite honest, the easiest way to cook Tom Yum is to go to your local  Asian market and buy a packet of "tom yum" seasoning paste. it will have  directions on the paste for making the soup. Thai people like this REALLY  hot and usually add way more chilies than i do.
