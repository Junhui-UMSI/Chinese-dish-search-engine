Aunt Mildreds Noodle Kugel
milk, Vanilla extract, Cornflake crumbs, to top, Sugar, Pineapple, crushed,, Noodles, uncooked, Cottage cheese, Eggs, Butter, 
Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.    Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles.  Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.    NOTES:    *  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting  because you dont cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.    *  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than  recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first. It also comes out very  flat -- most of the kugel recipes Ive made in the past use twice as many  noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be  increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.  : Precision:  no need to measure.    : susan@sftig.UUCP (S.Eisen)    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust  : AT&T Bell Laboratories, Summit, NJ
