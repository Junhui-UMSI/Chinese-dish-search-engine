Vienna Bread
Milk; scalded, Cold water, Yeast cake, Flour, Warm water, Sugar, Salt, 
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.  When dissolved, add the  cold water to the scalded milk and stir into the yeast mixture.  Sift the  salt with the flour and gradually stir this into the milk-yeast mixture.  Knead well on a lightly floured board for about 10 minutes, or until smooth  and elastic.  Place in a buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled,  about 1 1/2 hours.  Punch down and turn out again onto a lightly floured  board.  Knead again for 5 minutes.  Now shape the dough into 2 long or  round loaves and place them on buttered cookie sheet that has been  sprinkled with cornmeal.  Make gashes in the top with a sharp knife, as for  French Bread.  Cover and let rise again until doubled.  Brush with  egg-white glaze and bake in a 450F oven for 10 minutes, lower heat to 350F  and bake for 50 minutes longer.  Remove from oven, brush again with glaze,  and return to oven for another 30 minutes.  It is this long, long baking  that give the bread its distinctive flavor and crisp crust.
