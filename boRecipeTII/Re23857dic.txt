Asian Salad
DRESSING, Chinese chili-garlic paste, Cilantro leaves; chopped, Head bok choy; sliced thin, Seasoned rice vinegar, Bean sprouts, Carrots; grated, Green onions; sliced, 
Ive made a few more recipes from Gabe Mirkins book. The Cranberry Beans  and Kale was a dud for me (and so not posted here), but I liked the Asian  Salad. It also gave me a chance to use my nice Japanese slicer: the  Benriner. As with most his recipes, this makes a lot, you may want to halve  the recipe.    Mix vegetables in a bowl. Mix vinegar and chili-garlic paste together. Pour  dressing over vegetables and toss.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #295 by Michelle Dick <artemis@rahul.net> on  Dec 14, 97
