Or, Water to cover, Fresh ginger root, Duck; 6 to 7 pounds, Salt, Scallions, Soy sauce, Sherry, Sugar, 
1. Wipe duck inside and out with a damp cloth. Place breast-side up in a  heavy saucepan, tucking wings under body. Add water to cover and bring to a  boil.     2. Meanwhile cut scallions in 3-inch sections and slice ginger root. Then  add both, along with soy sauce, sherry and salt. Simmer, covered, 1 hour.     3. Turn bird over. Add sugar and simmer until done (about 1 hour more).     4. Cut breast meat against the grain in slices 1/2-inch thick. Arrange on  a serving platter, reconstructing the shape of the breast. (Or chop duck,  bones and all, in 2-inch sections.) Serve hot, with or without gravy. The  gravy may be reserved for later use as a master sauce (see recipe). Or  serve cold.     NOTE: The duck is done when the meat is so tender it nearly falls from the  bones.     VARIATIONS:        1. In step 1, use 1/3 stock, 2/3 water.        2. In step 2, add 5 dried black mushrooms (soaked) and 1/2 teaspoon  sesame oil.        3. Use 12 to 15 whole scallions (trim root ends, but keep stalks and  green leaves intact). Toss scallions in a mixture of 2 tablespoons soy  sauce and 1/2 teaspoon sugar, then place in duck cavity with the ginger  root. Bring to a boil as in step 1, then cook with seasonings as in steps 2  and 3. Serve bird whole with gravy.        4. For a smaller duck (3 to 4 pounds) use only 1 cup water, 2  tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sherry and 1 teaspoon sugar. Cook 1-1/2  hours, basting and turning for even coloring.
