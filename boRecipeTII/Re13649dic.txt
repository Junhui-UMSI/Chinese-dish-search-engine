Wild Mushroom Soup (Veloute Forestiere)
Flour, Dry wild mushrooms, Sherry, Fresh mushrooms, White stock, Fine sea salt, Onions, Black Pepper, Unsalted butter, Creme fraiche, 
1. Rinse the wild mushrooms well under running water; then soak them in  sherry for 1 hour. Drain the mushrooms and rinse off any remaining sand;  pass the sherry through a fine strainer and reserve. Leave whole or chop  mushrooms coarsely as desired. 2. Melt the butter in an 8 quart soup pot,  add the flour, and cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Add the chopped onions,  fresh mushrooms, and wild mushrooms. Add the stock and reserved sherry and  bring the soup to a boil, stirring occasionally. Lower the heat, cover  partially, and simmer 1 hour or until the wild mushrooms are very tender.  Add the seasonings, taste, and adjust. 3. Remove from the heat and let  stand 5 to 10 minutes before stirring in the creme fraiche.    MAKE IT EXTRA-LIGHT: Reduce the butter to 2 tbls and delete the creme  fraiche. Simmer uncovered until the soup has reached the desired thickness.    MAKE IT AHEAD: Prepare the recipe through Step 2 up to 4 or 5 hours in  advance and refrigerate. Reheat on the stove (not microwave); then proceed  with Step 3 before serving.    SERVING SUGGESTION: Serve this rich soup as a first course before a light  main course such as a grilled fish.
