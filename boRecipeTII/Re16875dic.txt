All-Purpose Potato-Based Gravy
Coursely ground black pepper, Or Organic Gourmet Vegetable, Water, Olive oil; amt. opt, Veggie stock concentrate;, Sm./1 lg      potato, Broth concentrate); to taste, Brown onion; coursely minced, 
(Optional: Any combination of stuff like poppy seeds, celery seeds, toasted  sesame seeds, Lawrys Seasoned Salt) Microwave the potato(s) for about 8  minutes more or less, depending on your potato(s) and your microwave. Then,  put them in a blender (do not peel) with the water and whirl until you have  a puree. Set aside. In a hot skillet (I use my trusty electric wok), saute  the onion in the olive oil until its the way you like it. Pour in the  potato puree, and moosh it around, cooking the hell out of it until its  also the way you like it (is there any other way?), adding seasonings to  taste. Thats it!  This is great over steamed veggies or grains or biscuits  or toast  or eggs or corn on the cob or spinach even potatos! You could try  it over ice cream or fruit salad but youd be really weird.

Big problem: How does a veggie       make       really good gravy with no pan drippins? Heres one way.
