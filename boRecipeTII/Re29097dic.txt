Baked Pretzels
Yeast, Water, Bread flour, Egg substitute, Salt, Water, Egg white, 
Add yeast, salt, bread flour, egg substitute, and 1/2 cup water in the  order suggested by the bread machine manufacturer and process on the dough  cycle. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray baking sheet with nonfat  cooking spray. When the dough cycle is complete, remove dough and place on  lightly-floured surface. Roll dough into 12x4-inch rectangle and cut into 8  (12-inch) strips. Pull each strip to about 14 inches in length. Form dough  into pretzel shape: Make a circle; cross the ends at the top, twist the  ends once and lay over the bottom of the circle. Pretzel logs can also be  shaped just by making rolled dough into a 12- to 14-inch rope. Place  pretzels on prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine egg white with  1 tablespoon water and brush on pretzels. If desired, sprinkle pretzels  with coarse salt, sesame, or poppy seeds. Bake in preheated oven 15 to 20  seconds. Serve with mustard or cheese dip. Source: "Recipes for Fat-free  Living: Breads for Bread Machines" by Jyl Steinback; 1996.
