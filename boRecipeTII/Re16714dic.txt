MEATBALLS: Combine all the meatball ingredients, except the oil, and mix  well. Form into 1 1/2-inch balls.  Brown the meatballs in the oil, remove,  and keep warm. SAUCE: To make the sauce, add the oil to the pan and saute  the onion and garlic until soft. Add the remaining sauce ingredients, bring  to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the sauce  is thickened. Place the sauce in a blender or food processor and puree  until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan, add the meatballs, and heat  through. TORTILLA CUPS: To make the tortilla cups, pour the oil to a depth  of 3 inches and heat to 375 degrees. Place a tortilla in the oil and let it  float for a couple of seconds.  Press the center into the oil with a can or  ladle to form a bowl and fry until crisp, remove, and drain. To serve,  place the lettuce in each of the tortilla cups, top with the albondigas,  and serve.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
