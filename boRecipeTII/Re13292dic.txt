Xans Rum Cake
Pecans, Rum; (cheap kind works as, SAUCE, Water, Eggs, Stick real butter, Rum, Water, French Vanilla instant, Wesson oil, Yellow cake mix, Sugar, 
This first recipe came from Gertoo of the ROTW group.    Sprinkle nuts on bottom of greased bundt pan. Mix ingredients adding one  egg at a time. Pour into pan and bake @ 350 F. for 1 hour.    Sauce: Boil together and pour over hot cake fresh from the oven. I poke  holes into cake with serving fork so sauce can absorb into cake faster. If  cake rises higher than pan just cut bottom off so it is level. Set cake  aside overnight.    Flip cake on serving platter. I normally loosen with hot water first just a  little.    Also a Christmas favorite - sounds alot more complicated than it is - but a  very pretty holiday recipe - enjoy!
