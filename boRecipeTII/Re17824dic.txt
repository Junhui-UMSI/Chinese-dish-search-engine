Unsweetened applesauce, BEAT IN, Lite preserves or, To 3 mashed very ripe, Whole wheat flour, Egg replacer equal to 1 egg, (reconstituted to liquid), Soy milk, MIX TOGETHER, Fruit-based jam, Wheat gluten, White vinegar, Baking soda, SIFT TOGETHER, Salt, STIR IN, Bananas, Baking Powder, 
Add dry ingredients to the batter, mixing well.  Stir in 1/4 C raisins or  date pieces (found in the bulk bins at some health food stores).  Fill  cupcake size muffin tins 3/4 full.  (Batter is very thick.)  Bake 30  minutes at 350 degrees, until top is brown and has a hard crust. Cool  slightly, then remove from tins. Makes 12. This is a great recipe to double  or triple, depending on how many ripe bananas you have.    These freeze beautifully and can be popped in the oven or toaster oven at  350 degrees for about 15 minutes to give them that fresh baked feel, if  desired.    I use a nonstick muffin pan but I just picked up some cushionaire muffin  tins and find the breads came out lighter now.  I do NOT spray the tins  with any Pam.
