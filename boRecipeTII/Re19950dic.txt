I like it, because it has no  added sugar.  I love it on top of pancakes and waffles.    Combine all ingredients in a blender container and blend until smooth. Pour  pureed mixture into a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to  low and simmer for about 1 hour and 20 minutes with the lid ajar to allow  steam to escape. Cool to room temperature in the original applesauce jar or  other container. Store covered container in refrigerator.    Makes about 2 1/2 pounds of apple butter.  From: Seneca Applesauce.
