Vegetable Puff
Green Chilies, Ready to use pastry roll, To taste Salt, Mixed Vegetables ( potatoes,, To taste Masala, 
This is a local Karnataka speciality.    Method: Cook a vegetable mix with potatoes, peas, green chilies and lots of  Masala. Check for salt, before you stuff it in the pastry roll; no way to  rectify it later.    Thaw the roll for about 10 minutes before unfolding.    After the pastry roll has thawed, open it out on a flat sheet and roll it  with a pin to make it a little thinner. The pastry sheet would now be about  12" x 12".    Cut the sheet into 6 pieces.    Place about 2-3 Tbsp of the cooked vegetable onto the sheet and fold it  around it. Seal all the corners, by pressing the sheets together and  applying a little water.    Stick it into a pre-heated oven (350 $F^\circ$) for about 20-30 minutes or  until it browns. Make sure that you flip it around every 5-10 minutes.
