Eggs, Salt, Sugar, Flour, milk, Vegetable oil for frying, Pecans; finely chopped, Strawberry or apricot, 
These are 5 recipes that I formatted from  http://www.pbs.org/mpt/jewishcooking/. Joan Nathan did a 5 part series on  Jewish Cooking in America. Included with the recipes were actual photos of  the preparation.    Mix together in a bowl the eggs, salt, 4 tablespoons of the sugar, the  flour, and the milk, beating until smooth. Heat a 6-inch frying pan over  medium heat with a teaspoon of oil. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the batter  into the pan or enough to completely cover the bottom of the pan when it is  swirled around. After 1 to 2 minutes on one side, flip it to finish  cooking. Remove from the pan and set aside to cool. Repeat with the  remaining batter, adding small amounts of oil when necessary. Put the  chopped pecans and the preserves in separate bowls. Preheat the oven to 350  degrees. Grease a round baking pan, and in the bottom of the pan place 1  crepe. Spoon a film of strawberry preserves over the crepe. Cover this with  another crepe and layer this one with the nuts. Continue to layer the  crepes alternatively with the preserves and the nuts, finishing with the  preserves. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 15 minutes until the  preserves caramelize. Cut as you would a pie. Yield: approximately 12  crepes or 1 tower        Recipe by: Joan Nathan/Agnes Stern    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Bob & Carole Walberg <walberg@escape.ca> on  Nov 06, 1998,
