Quick Vegetable Jumble
(Polaner brand is packed in, Dehydrated onion flakes, Vinaigrette dressing, Drained, (or 1*tsp garlic powder), SEASONING OPTION 3, Black pepper, 10-oz brick frozen spinach,, Kidney beans (or substitute, SEASONING OPTION 1, Thawed and somewhat, Great Northerns), Paprika, Italian seasoning, (and drain the corn more, 15-oz cans corn, somewhat, Drained, SEASONING OPTION 2, Bottled Italian or, Canned chopped garlic, Thoroughly), 15-oz can Italian white, Water), 
Rip up the spinach a bit, if its in huge stringy clumps. Toss everything  together in a bowl.  Let sit for a few minutes if youve got dry spices in  there.  Heat up if you feel like it, else eat cold.    Id like to try this with chopped red bell pepper in it - I think it would  taste good, and I know it would look good...    It would also taste good with kidney or black beans, but the darker liquid  from the beans would make the dish look muddy.  Most of my veggie cooking  looks brown (or red) and boring - its a nice change to eat something  bright and pretty...    Actually, I usually make this with frozen corn...  but I dont measure  that, I just pour it from the bag...    Posted by "Aliza R.
