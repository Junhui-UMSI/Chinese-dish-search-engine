We attribute this recipe to the Mennonite colony of Ontario.  Its  often served at picnics and is known as one of the favorite foods at  stag parties.    Prepare pigs tails according to Step I in basic instructions; cut in  3-inch pieces.  Place pigs tails on a rack and bake in a 300F oven  for 2 to 3 hours, until meat is tender and most of the fat has baked  off. An alternate method to this is to simmer the pigs tails in  acidulated water for 1 1/2 hours.    Combine all other ingredients for barbecue sauce, coating tails well.  Grill over hot charcoal, turning and basting, until crisp.  If fresh  rosemary is available, break off several branches, tie them together  and use as a basting brush.  For barbecuing, we prefer leaving the  tails uncut or halved so as to have fewer piece to constantly turn.    Serve with traditional barbecue accompaniments such as corn-on-the-  cob, French bread and green salad.    Serves 6 to 8.    All these recipes are from "Innards and Other Variety Meats".
