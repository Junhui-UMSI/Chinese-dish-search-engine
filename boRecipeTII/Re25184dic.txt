Tomatoes and Kale Side Dish Vegan (r T)
Tomatoes, Canned, cut, in, Italian seasoning, Leaves Kale, curly, 
NOTE: Can use any green not only kale    A few days ago I got a craving for something with kale, and decided to see  what I could toss together with what was in the pantry. The result is a  very tasty side dish that could hardly be easier to cook: Cut or tear kale  into bite-sized pieces. Place in a colander and rinse under running water.  Dont drain too thoroughly, as you want a fair bit of water to remain on  the leaves. Place the washed kale into a non-stick frying pan on medium  heat. Stir as the leaves wilt.    When the leaves are wilted but not completely tender (they should be a  brilliant green at this point), add the ready-cut tomatoes, reserving the  juice. Sprinkle the spices over the pan and continue to stir for a few  moments, until the tomatoes are heated through.    Add reserved tomato juice to taste; adding a lot will make a soup-like  dish, while adding a little will make more of a traditional side dish.    This is really very good and quick to make...Reggie    NOTES : Cal  73.3, Fat 1g, Carb 15g, Dietary Fiber 3.2g, Protein 4.4g,  Sodium  228mg, CFF 10.3%.
