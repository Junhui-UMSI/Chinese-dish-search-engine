Peanut Butter and Jelly Filled Spiders
Reduced fat peanut butter, Strawberry jam, Frozen Bread Dough; thawed, 
Prepare two baking sheets with cooking spray; set aside. In a small bowl,  combine peanut butter and jam; set aside. Divide dough into sixteen equal  pieces. It takes two pieces of dough to make one spider. To make spider,  take one piece of dough, on a lightly floured surface, divide this piece  into four equal pieces for spiders legs. Roll each of these pieces into  thin ropes, each being eight inches long. Lay each of these ropes, parallel  and equal in length to each other, half inch apart onto prepared baking  sheet. For the spiders body, divide a second piece of dough, one twice as  large as the other. On a floured surface, pat larger piece of dough with  the palm of your hand to flatten. Place two teaspoons peanut butter and jam  mixture onto center of circle. Bring ends of dough up together and seal  seams. Gently roll this piece of dough into a ball; set aside. Roll smaller  piece of dough in a round ball (this will be the spiders head). Place  peanut butter filled body and head centered on top of the four ropes of  dough. The spider should now have eight legs. FInish with remaining pieces  of dough to make eight spiders. Let rise until doubled in size, one hour.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for ten minutes, or until golden brown.
