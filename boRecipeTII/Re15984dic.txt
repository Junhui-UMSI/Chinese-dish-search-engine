Aebleskiver #2
Eggs, Grams sugar, Baking soda, Grams flour, Liter buttermilk, 
A couple of months back there was a discussion on how to make Aebleskiver.  As a lover of Aebleskiver it really hurt me to see how "distorted" some of  these reci pes were. So when I bought the book "Mad", by Ingeborg Suhr from  1942 I decided to enlighten you poor netters.  The following three recipes  are from the country where Aebleskiver originated and are the "real thing".  Although Ingeborg Suhr does not say anything about it I would suggest  serving with either sifted confectioners sugar, blackberry jam or both. At  Christmas I would suggest serving with glogg.     Sift baking soda with flour. Mix all ingredients cold.  Bake immediately  (see Aebleskiver #1).  Fill holes in pan completely.
