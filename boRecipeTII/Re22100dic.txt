Turkey Kabobs
Mushrooms, Can pineapple chunks, Turkey breast, diced 1" cube, Bell Peppers diced 1" cube, Onion, diced 1" cube, 
* Make sure the Kabob swords fit your grill. Either they should fit  entirely inside the grill or long enough to place across the lip of the  cooker like a rotisserie. This way the meat and vegetables will cook  evenly. * Make a moderate fire.    Dice all of the turkey breast, onion, and bell peppers. Alternate red and  green peppers to make a nice presentation. Use the pineapple juice to  marinate the mushrooms for about an hour. Thread the meat and vegetables on  the swords as you think will make a good presentation. Cook over the fire  until the meat is done. Baste with the pineapple juice while cooking. Serve  with white rice.
