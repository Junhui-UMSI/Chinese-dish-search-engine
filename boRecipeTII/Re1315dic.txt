By Sheldon Margen, M.D., and Dale A. Ogar Health and Fitness News Service    If you like twice-baked potatoes but arent willing to use up a whole days  fat allowance by mixing them with cheese and butter, heres a suggestion  from the "Wellness Simply Healthy Cookbook" (Rebus, 1995).    Bake potatoes as usual in oven or microwave. When cool enough to handle,  cut both in half lengthwise.    With a fork, fluff the potato flesh inside and transfer to a bowl, leaving  enough potato attached to the skin to form a sturdy shell. Add the cottage  cheese, buttermilk, cream cheese, scallions, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of the  jalapeno pepper and the black pepper to the scooped-out potato. Mix well to  combine, then spoon back into the potato shells.    Return to the oven and bake until the stuffing is piping hot, about 20  minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, mix together the tomatoes, bell  pepper, red onion, cilantro, vinegar, sugar, salt and remaining 1 and 1/2  teaspoons of jalapeno pepper.    Spoon salsa over the potatoes and serve. Makes 4 servings, each of which  has 151 calories, 2.3 g fat, 6.6 mg cholesterol, 254 mg sodium, 62 mg  vitamin C, 57 mg calcium, 3.4 g dietary fiber.
