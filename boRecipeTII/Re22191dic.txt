Trim green onions of roots and all but 3" of green.  Cut celery, cucumber,  and green onions into 2-1/2" matchstick strips.    Make vinaigrette dressing: combine orange peel, orange juice, vinegars, soy  sauce, and mustard in bowl; whisk well.  Slowly drizzle in peanut and  sesame oil, whisking constantly until dressing is slightly thick.    In bowl, toss turkey with black pepper and 1/3 c dressing. Use more  dressing if desired.  Reserve remaining dressing for another use.    To serve, arrange watercress on platter.  Spoon dressed turkey onto center.  Arrange celerly, cucumber, and green onions decoratively over turkey.    After heavy holiday meals, the freshness of this salad is a welcome treat.  Matchstick strips of crisp celery, cucumbers, and scallions are easy enough  to prepare with a sharp knife, and the results are elegant and decorative  when arranged atop the dressed turkey.
