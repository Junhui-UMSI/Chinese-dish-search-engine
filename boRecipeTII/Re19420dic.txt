Vegetarian Chili
Onion, diced, &1/2 cup water, Refried beans (watch out, Garlic powder, Tomato sauce, Sugar, Chili powder, 
Bring water to boil.  Add onion and cook on med. boil till fairly  transparent.  Reduce heat to low.  Add remaining ingredients. Stir till  beans are smooth and heated, a minute or two. I ate it with a dollop of  sour cream and some raw diced onion but it is good without any garnish at  all. I hope you like it, Connie.
