Polish Butter Cookies
Vanilla extract, Almond extract, Sugar, Unsalted Butter, , Egg Yolks, Egg Yolk, All-Purpose Flour, 
1. Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar in a mixing  bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the cooked and raw egg yolks and both  extracts. Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate the flour to make a  smooth, somewhat stiff dough. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate 2  hours. 2. Preheat the oven to 350 F. 3. Roll out the dough 2/3 inch thick  on a lightly floured surface. (The cookies are supposed to be plump.) Cut  into shapes with small 1 to 1 1/2-inch cookie cutters - hearts and stars  work nicely. Gather up the scraps, reroll, and cut out more cookies. Place  1/2 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. 4. Bake cookies until they just  begin to take on the slightest tinge of color, about 10 mins. Cool on wire  racks and store in an airtight container up to 1 week. Makes about 6 dozen  small cookies.
