There are certain dishes that bring back memories, sometimes of a person.  I had a dear friend in graduate school in theology by the name of Ora Lee.  She was raised in Virginia and she gave me this recipe. I make one now and  start to laugh over the good times that we shared and then I become  terribly sad that I have lost track of her. Perhaps this recipe will cause  her to get in touch with me and we can eat this terrific pie  together...again.      Using your electric mixture, cream the butter and sugar together. Add the  syrup and whip until light. In a separate bowl, whip the eggs and salt  together until light and fluffy. Combine the eggs with the sugar mixture  along with the flour, vanilla, and cinnamon. Mix well and pour into pie  crust. Sprinkle pecans on top and bake in a 350? oven for 50 minutes.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
