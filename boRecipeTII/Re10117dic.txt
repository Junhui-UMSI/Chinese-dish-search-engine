"Quemada" literally means "burnt" -- and that is what is done to the  tomatoes and green onions, giving the salsa a smoky flavor and rich color.    Place tomatoes and green onions on a hot mesquite grill (over hot coals,  not flames).  Pile the cilantro on top, so that it does not touch the  grill.  Grill the vegetables 10 to 15 minutes, or until the peppers are  soft. Place the vegetable oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat.  Add  the serranos and saute until the peppers are soft. Place the serranos,  tomatoes, onion, and cilantro in a food processor fitted with the metal  blade.  Process until coarsely ground.  Remove tomato mixture to mixing  bowl and stir until ingredients are evenly distributed.  In a separate  bowl, mix garlic, lime juice, salt, white pepper, oregano, and water until  well- blended.  Add garlic mixture to ground vegetables and mix thoroughly.  Makes about 3 cups.
