Pickled Peach Slices
Allspice berries, Cloves, 4 inch cinnamon stick, Dried red chilies, Peaches, White wine vinegar, Brown sugar, 
Scald, stone & slice the peaches.  Put the vinegar into the pan with the  remaining ingredients.  Stir over a low heat to dissolve the sugar. Bring  the vinegar to a boil. Cover & simmer for 15 minutes. Put in the peaches &  simmer uncovered for 2 minutes. Lift out the peaches with a slotted spoon &  place them in warmed pickling jars. Boil the vinegar for 10 minutes to  thicken it.  Pour the vinegar over the peach slices. Cover immediately &  seal.  Let stand for 3 weeks before using.    Gail Duff, "A Book of Herbs & Spices"
