In a 3-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and  garlic and sweat them until translucent, but not browned, about 5 minutes.    Add the butternut and acorn squash, turnips and carrots. Cover and sweat  for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Add the stock and the thyme, bay leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cayenne,  allspice, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, lower the heat  to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, until the vegetables are soft.  Stir occasionally.    While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the shallots. Trim off both ends,  cut them in half lengthwise, then thinly slice them lengthwise to get half  moon pieces. Heat  inch of oil in a 10-inch frying pan over medium heat.  Fry the shallots in two batches until golden brown (the shallot should  sizzle on contact with the oil), about 30 seconds. Drain on paper towels  and salt lightly. The shallots will get crispier when then cool and may be  made a day ahead  just cover them well and keep them at room temperature.    Pure the vegetables in a food processor or blender, adding a little cream  or butter if desired. Season with a squeeze of lemon juice, then taste and  adjust the seasonings. Serve in a shallow bowl sprinkled with the crispy  shallots.
