Sweet Winter Squash Soup
Butternut or buttercup --, Chopped carrot, Minced fresh ginger, Sliced onion, Peeled & chopped apple, Water, 
Put the whole squash in a microwave oven and cook on high power for 8  minutes. Peel the squash and cut into cubes. (If you dont have a microwave  oven, this step may be omitted. This brief cooking time simply makes the  squash easier to peel and cut up.) Place all of the ingredients in a large  soup pot and simmer over medium-low heat for 45 minutes. Place the soup in  a blender or food processor, in batches, and blend until smooth and creamy.    Posted by Michelle Dick, FATFREE listowner, while list was down.
