1. Place potatoes in a 4- to 6-quart pot-, cover with water. Bring to a  boil, cover, and simmer, stirring once or twice to ensure even cooking,  until a thin-bladed paring knife or a metal cake tester inserted into the  potato can be removed with no resistance (25 to 30 minutes for medium  potatoes and 15 to 20 minutes for newpotatoes). Drain, cool potatoes  slightly and peel if you like. Cut potatoes (use a serrated knife if they  have skins) into 3/4-inch cubes while still warm, rinsing knife  occasionally in warm water to remove gumminess.    2. Layer warm potato cubes in medium bowl, sprinkle with vinegar, salt, and  pepper as you go. Refrigerate while preparing remaining ingredients.    3. Mix in remaining ingredients-, refrigerate until ready to serve.    Serves 6 to 8.    Cooks Illustrated, July/Aug. 1994, Page 8. Credit: Pam Anderson with Karen  Tack.
