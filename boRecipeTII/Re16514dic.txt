Curry powders are an important part of African cooking due to the heavy  influence of Arabic and Indian cuisine in Africa.  Curry powders are made  from different proportions of spices, dried and ground.  Spices can be  dried in the sun for two to three days, in a low temperature oven, or on  top of the stove in a dry skillet.  If using a skillet be sure to shake the  spices constantly so they dont burn.  Grinding is usually done with a  mortar and pestle.  Curry powders are not necessarily hot, they are made  that way by the addition of chili peppers.    Brown the spices in a hot oven until crisp.  Grind and seal in an airtight  container until used.  Add 1 teas. powdered turmeric, and chili powder to  taste for every teas. of your special curry powder.
