Take care and have a great weekend!!!    1.  Dissolve the sugar in the hot water. 2. Add the root beer concentrate  and let cool. 3. Combine the root beer mixture with the cold seltzer water,  drink immediately, or store in fridge in tightly covered container.    The root beer youll make here is a simplified version of Roy Allens  method from the early 1900s.  Instead of harvesting roots, herbs, and  berries, you have the luxury of using a root beer concentrate that can be  found in most grocery stores. In 1922 Allen expanded his business, he  formed a partnership with entrepreneur Frank Wright. This led to the name  that would become famous, A&W, the countrys best-selling root beer.
