Note: Make this a day ahead so you can skim off the  fat. Preheat oven to 375F.  Cover both sides of brisket with lots of pepper. Over  a medium flame, heat the oil in a heavy casserole or  roasting dish and brown the brisket on all sides. Take  the brisket out of the pan and set aside. Add the  onions to the casserole and cook them over medium-high  heat. As you stir them, scrape up the brown bits from  the bottom of the casserole. cook the onions for about  15 minutes, or until they are thoroughly browned. Add  the carrots, garlic, and bay leaves; stir for another  1-2 minutes. Take the casserole off the burner and  carefully put the brisket back into its nest of  vegetables. Coat the brisket on both sides with tomato  paste. Sprinkle more pepper, and a little salt, over  the tomato paste. Pour the tomatoes and red wine into  the bottom of the casserole. Cover the casserole  tightly, first with a layer of foil and then with the  lid. Let the pot roast cook on the middle rack of the  oven for 3? hours. check the liquid level in the  casserole frequently; if it gets too low, add a little  water or beef broth. When the meat is tender, take it  out of the oven. Keep the meat covered while you cool  it to room temperature. Then put it in the  refrigerator overnight. The next day, spoon off all  the solidified fat you can. Discard the bay leaves.  Bring the meat back to room temperature and reheat it  ?? along with its juices and the vegetables ?? either  on top of the stove or in the oven. When its hot,  slice it on the diagonal and serve with the pan juices  and vegetables spooned over. Add salt at the table, if  needed.
