Heat a large saute pan and add the oil. When the oil is heated add the  diced chicken or tofu and stir fry until lightly golden. Add the remaining  vegetables and continue stir frying until lightly cooked (do not overcook  vegetables).  Then add the noodles and the oyster sauce (if using) and cook  through, or until the noodles are cooked. They need not be cooked  separately as the juices from the vegetables provide moisture. Season to  your taste.    Recipe By     : Sunshine Magazine (9/17/95)
