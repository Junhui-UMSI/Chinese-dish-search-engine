These can be found at  Safeway or any good Deli or specialty food or cooking store. They are about  $50.    Whip the eggs until very frothy.  Add the sugar and cream well. Add the  melted shortening--be sure it is not hot--and cream well.  Add the  flavorings and mix well.    I use anise oil because the flavor is more intense--use just a little more  if you really like a strong anise flavor.    Measure half the flour in a very large bowl--8 qt. size or better--add the  egg mixture and mix together with a heavy wooden spoon--or any large spoon.  Add the remaining half of the flour one cup at a time and mix well.  You  have added enough flour when the mixture "glomps" off the spoon and is  still a little runny--not real thick. Usually 7 cups of flour is  adequate--depends on the weather (really!).    Heat up the iron for a few minutes then make the cookies by placing 1 full  teaspoon full of the dough in the center of each form.  Press closed  tightly and cook for about 1 minute. Immediately move the cookie to wax  paper to cool. The cookies are very soft at this point and will take the  shape of any bumps in the wax paper--so make it smooth. This recipe makes  about 14 -20 dozen cookies depending on the size you make them. It can be  cut in half easily without losing any flavor. When the cookies are  thoroughly cool--crisp--stack them and leave them in the open--do not cover  they will become very soft and unappetizing. If you can, do not eat them  for about 3 days to a week. The flavor of the anise improves with a few  days age.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
