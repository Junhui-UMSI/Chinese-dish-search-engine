Baked Stuffed Salmon
Capers, Fresh parsley, Salt, Pepper, Hot water, Salmon, Herb-seasoned stuffing, Bacon, Lemon slices, Onion, Butter, Parsely, 
Rinse and thoroughly dry the salmon, inside and out. In a 2 quart mixing  bowl combine the stuffing mix, hot water, capers, and chopped parsley. Toss  lightly with a fork until the mixture is moist and blended. Place the  minced bacon in a heavy 12 inch skillet and saute over medium heat for 4-6  minutes or until bacon is tender. Add the onion and saute for 3-5 minutes  more until bacon is crisp, stirring frequently. Add the bacon, onion, and  pan drippings to the stuffing mixture in the mixing bowl. Toss lightly with  a fork to combine. Brush the inside of the salmon with the melted butter  and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity of the fish  loosely with the stuffing mixture. Skewer or sew the opening shut.    Line with heavy foil a shallow baking dish or a pan large enough to  accommodate the fish. Place the fish on the baking pan and bake in a  preheated 425 degree oven for 25 minutes or until fish flakes easily when  tested with a fork. Remove from oven and keep warm. When ready to serve,  the skin can be removed easily, leaving head and tail intact. Coat the fish  with Cucumber Sauce, garnish with lemon slices and parsley and serve at  once.
