For watermelon boat, cut a  thin slice from bottom of melon with a sharp knife to allow it to sit flat.  Mark a horizontal cutting line 2 in. above center of melon. With a long  sharp knife, cut into melon along cutting line, making sure to cut all the  way through. Gently pull of top section of rind. Remove fruit from both  sections and cut into cubes or balls; set aside. To cut decorative edge,  place melon on its side. Position a 2-1/2-in. 8-point star cookie cutter  against inside edge of melon, allowing only half of star to cut through  melon. Insert a toothpick into flat edge of removed piece. Attach piece  onto melon edge where last cut ends. Repeat cutting and attaching pieces  until; entire melon edge is completed. Combine honeydew, cantaloupe,  strawberries, grapes and watermelon; spoon into boat. Serve dressing on the  side. Yield: 32-36 servings (about 2 cups dressing). Editors Note: Any  star or petal cutter with an even number of points may be used. Or serve  this salad in an 8-qt. serving bowl.    NOTES : "Wow! is what folks will say when they dig into this lovely fruit  salad piled high in an eye-catching watermelon boat, relates Ruth Seitz of  Columbus Junction, Iowa."
