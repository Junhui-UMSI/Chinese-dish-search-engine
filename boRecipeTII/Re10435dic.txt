Recipe by: McDougall Preparation Time: 0:30 Mix dry ingredients together in  a medium bowl. Add optional spices, if desired. Mix honey and warm water  together, then add to dry ingredients, stirring just until mixed. Pour into  lightly oiled or non-stick 8-inch square baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees  for 20 minutes.    HELPFUL HINTS: Various spices may be added for different flavors. Pieces of  finely chopped or grated vegetables also may be added. Try finely chopped  onion, finely chopped green pepper, chopped green chilis, chopped pimiento,  grated carrots, grated zucchini. Used alone or in various combinations,  they add special appeal to this simple, tasty corn bread. If you have a  nonstick baking pan, it is not necessary to oil it first. This recipe also  may be used for muffins. Increase baking powder to 4 teaspoons. Fill oiled  or papered muffin tins two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20  minutes.
