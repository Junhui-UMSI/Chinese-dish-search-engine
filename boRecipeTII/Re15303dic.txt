submitted by: KSalter@L2.lonet.ca (Katherine Salter, London, Ontario,  Canada)  Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, cumin, oregano  and red pepper. Saute 5 minutes. Push onion to one side. Season chicken  with salt and pepper and add to pan. Saute chicken for about 5 minutes.    Drain beans and reserve 1/2 c. of liquid. Add beans, broth, chillies, cream  and reserved bean liquid to chicken mixture. Simmer until chicken is tender  and cooked through. I think this takes about 10 minutes. Season with salt  and pepper to taste. Serve with grated cheddar as garnish. Serves 4 - 6.
