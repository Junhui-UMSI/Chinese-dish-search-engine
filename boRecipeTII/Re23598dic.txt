Arthur Treacher Style Fish
Milk; or more as needed, Basil, Pancake mix, Lemon juice, Fish Fillets; Firm, White, Club Soda (approx.), Pepper, Garlic salt, Cooking oil, Flour, 
Cut fish fillets in half, making triangular shape. Cover with milk and  lemon juice and refrigerate 3-4 hours. Drain off milk.  Dip fillets in  flour to coat each piece lightly. Let dry on a cookie sheet,  making sure  pieces do not tough. Add oil to deep fryer or heavy pan to a  depth of at  least 3 inches. Heat oil to 425~. Combine pancake mix, basil, pepper,  garlic salt and enough soda to make a thick batter, about the consistency  of buttermilk. Dip floured fillets in batter and add to the hot oil one at  a time. Fry 4-5 minutes. Remove filets to cookie sheet, again, not letting  them touch and keep warm in a 250~ oven. Deep fry remaining filets, keeping  the depth of the oil at least 3 inches. NOTE: Do not heap fish as this  creates steam in the oven and makes coating soft.
