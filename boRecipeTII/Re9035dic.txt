Massage each short rib with the dry rub. Place the ribs in plastic trash  bag, and put them in the refrigerator overnight.    The next day mix the mop sauce and prepare the pit for smoking. Place the  ribs in the pit, fatty side up, and cook them between 200 degrees and 220  degrees for 5 hours. Until the last hour, baste with the mop sauce every 30  to 60 minutes.    While the ribs are smoking, prepare the glaze so it is ready to apply  approximately 45 minutes before the meat is done. Mix the glaze ingredients  in a saucepan, and bring them to a simmer, stirring frequently. Cook the  mixture for 30 minutes.    Mop the glaze on the top and sides of the ribs twice during the last 30 to  60 minutes of cooking time. (Never apply glaze before the last hour or it  will burn.) Return the remaining glaze to the stove, and simmer it until  its reduced by one-third, about 15 to 20 minutes.    After removing the ribs from the pit, allow them to sit 10 minutes, and  then trim the fat. Serve them with the reduced glaze on the side.
