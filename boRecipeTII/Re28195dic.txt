Make the Bean Filling:  Coarsely mash the beans.  Stir in the onion,  garlic, chilies, chili powder, cumin and vinegar.    Make the Beef Filling: Saute the beef, onion, and garlic and a skillet over  medium heat, breaking up the meat into small bits. Cook until the beef is  browned and the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Drain off fat in a  colander. Wipe out skillet with paper towels, and return the meat mixture  to it, off the heat.  Stir in the chilis, chili powder, cumin and salt to  taste.    Finish the dish: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place a disk of daugh on  a work surface. Spoon 2 scant tablespoons of bean filling onto one half  leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge.  Top with 1 tablespoon grated  cheese if you like. Brush the edges of the dough with water. Fold the dough  over the filling, forming a half circle. With the tines of a fork, press  the edges together firmly, and poke a few holes, in the top to let the  steam escape.  REpeat until you have used all the filling. Use the same  procedure with the meat filling topping with 1 tablespoon salsa if you  wish. Place the empanadas on a baking sheet, and coast them lightly with  vegetable oil spray.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Serve  hot or at room temperature.
