* Note: See the "Emerils Essence Information" recipe which is included in  this collection.    In a large saute pan, with a lid, over medium heat, add the olive oil.  Season the pork with Emerils Essence. When the oil is hot, add the pork,  in batches, and sear for about 1 minute on each side or 4 minutes total,  stirring constantly. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside.    Add the onions and crumbled bay leaves. Season the onions with salt and a  pinch of crushed red pepper. Saute the onions for about 4 to 6 minutes or  until the onions are golden. Add the garlic and continue to saute for 1  minute. Stir in the tomato paste. Deglaze the pan with the wine, scrapping  the browned particles from the bottom of the pan. Bring the liquid to a  boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the liquid for about 2 minutes. Add the  seared pork meat to the pan and continue to cook until the meat is tender,  about 2 hours.    Add the clams and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and cover the pan.  Continue to cook for about 25 to 30 minutes or until the clams open their  shell. Discard any shells that do not open. Spoon the mixture into shallow  bowls and serve with crusty bread.    This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.
