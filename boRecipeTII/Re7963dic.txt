TO MAKE DOUGH: Mix flour with warm water and knead for     10 to 15  minutes. There is no need to add any flour on the board as you knead  because the dough should be at a perfect consistency. Let dough rest for 20  minutes       while you make the filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Partially thaw  spinach and lightly squeeze out liquid (leave         some liquid with the  spinach). Mix with rest of            ingredients. WRAPPING: Divide dough  into 4 parts. Roll each part out to about 12 inches in length and divide  into 12 balls. Roll each ball into 3 inch round flat       discs and drop 1  tbsp. of filling in center. Fold the      dough over the filling, pinching  together just the top     to make a half circle. On the side nearest you,  form 2 to 3 pleats on each side and pinch them to meet the opposite side to  seal.                                     COOKING: Heat 2 tbsp. of oil in a  12 inch heavy            skillet over medium high heat. Lightly brown Pot  Stickers until golden on the bottom, pour 1 cup water into the skillet and  cover immediately. Cook over medium heat until most of the liquid is  absorbed. Uncover and continue cooking until liquid is completely absorbed  and the Pot Stickers are golden        brown on the bottom. Serve with dip.  Another good dip      is chili oil. DO AHEAD NOTES: Wrap and freeze them.  Cook just before serving. Pot Stickers turn out even better when the  freezing process gives the filling         additional moisture, making them  juicier and tastier!      Add 5-7 more minutes to cooking time if frozen.  COMMENTS: To prevent Pot Stickers from actually sticking to the bottom of  the pan, it is best to use       either a Teflon, a heavy bottom commercial  aluminum, a     cast iron or a well seasoned steel skillet.
