Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    Whisk the eggs, half-and-half, heavy cream, vanilla, sugar, cinnamon and  nutmeg, together until the sugar dissolves. Stir in the bread cubes and  allow the mixture to sit for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Stir in the  chocolate pieces and sliced bananas. Pour the mixture into a greased 10 cup  baking dish. Bake the pudding for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the  pudding sets. Remove the pan from the oven. The pudding can be served right  from the oven, warm or room temperature.    For the bourbon sauce, Melt the butter in a double boiler over simmering  water. Add the sugar and whisk to dissolve. Add the bourbon and whisk for 1  minute. Remove from the heat and drizzle in the egg yolks, whisking  constantly. Return the double boiler to the heat and continue whisking  until the sauce is pale and slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Spoon the  sauce over the pudding and serve immediately. Garnish with mint sprigs.
