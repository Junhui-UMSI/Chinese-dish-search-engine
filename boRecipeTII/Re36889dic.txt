Cut in the shortening using a pastry cutter forming  pea size grains. Stir in enough milk to form a sticky ball of dough. Divide  into equal portions, 2 per shortcake biscuit cake. For each cake, press one  portion into the bottom of a greased and floured (9") metal pie pan. Spread  with butter.  Place the second portion on top.  Bake until done (12-15  minutes).  Cut into wedges (one per portion).  Separate the layers in each  of the portions. Spread whipped cream on top of each layer. Top each layer  with strawberries. Reassemble. Serve.
