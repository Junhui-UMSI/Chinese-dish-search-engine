Here is a recipe for an authentic Tofu steak from the best seller recipe  magazine in Japan. Enjoy!    1. Place a clean cloth towel in a shallow  plate (something like brownie  pan would be good) and put Tofu on it for 30 minutes to drain water. Wipe  the surface of Tofu with paper towels and sprinkle some salt (to make the  surface of the steak crisp and brown when done.)    2. Cut off the stem of mushrooms and slice them. divide Enoki into small  bunch. Cut green onions in 2 inches long. Finely chop garlic.    3. Put 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in a frying pan and fry both sides of Tofu  in medium-high heat, until Tofu turn golden brown. Put them on serving  plates.    4. Wipe the frying pan with paper towel and add another 2 Tbsp of vegetable  oil. Saute garlic and the mushrooms in medium heat quickly. Add Sake, soy  sauce and Dashi stock and bring it to boil. Add green onions.  Dissolve  cornstarch in 2Tbsp of water and add to the sauce. Stir from the bottom of  the pan and pour it over the cooked Tofu. Serve while hot! (4 servings)    NOTE: Dashi is the basic soup stock used in most Japanese dishes such as  Miso Soup and Udon. You can get the powered stock called Hondashi in any  Oriental stores. Substitute it with chicken stock if you like. Shiitake and  Enoki are very expensive in the U.S., but they are very flavorful. Try not  to cook them too long.
