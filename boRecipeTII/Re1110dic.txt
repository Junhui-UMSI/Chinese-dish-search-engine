From the Detroit News    Trim ends off beans, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and put into a heavy, 2-quart  saucepan. Steam or cook over medium heat until crisp tender, about 7 to 8  minutes. Drain well and set aside on a plate. (If they stay in the hot pan,  they will continue to cook.) Chop onion, seed and chop jalapeno peppers  finely and mince garlic. Heat oil in large, heavy, nonstick skillet or wok;  add onion, peppers and garlic and stir-fry until onion is translucent but  not brown, about 2 minutes. Bring chicken broth or water to a boil in same  pan in which beans were cooked. Stir in couscous, allow to return to a boil  and immediately turn off heat and cover. Let stand 10 minutes then fluff  with a fork. Cut zucchini into small dice and add to onion. Cut corn from  cob and chop tomatoes; add both to pan. Cook just until zucchini is crisp  tender. Return cooked green beans to pan long enough to heat through.    Season with freshly ground black pepper. Just before serving, lightly stir  in chopped basil or cilantro, if desired. Serve immediately over couscous.  Makes 4 servings. Preparation: 15-20 minutes. Cooking: 15 minutes.
