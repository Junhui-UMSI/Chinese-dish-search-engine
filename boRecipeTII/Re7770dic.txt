Porter
Munton & Fison dark hopped, Extract, Cascade hops pellets, Edme ale yeast, Edme bitters kit, Stick brewers licorice, Toasted barley, Flaked barley, Northern Brewer hops, Pellets, 
Make  toasted  barley into a tea. Bring flaked barley to  boil.   Sparge  with kitchen strainer and boiling water. Boil extracts and Cascade hops.  Add Northern Brewer. Cool and Pitch. This makes what I consider to be an  excellent  porter.  Fermentation seemed to take off and I bottled within 7  days of brewing.  Fermentation took place at 74 degrees. Original Gravity:  1.045 Final Gravity: 1.005 Primary Ferment: 2 days Secondary Ferment: 5  days    Recipe By     : Gary Benson    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
