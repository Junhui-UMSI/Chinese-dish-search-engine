Divid  dough into 24 equal portions.Spead each to form a 4 inch square, keeping  one edge of dough even with edge of wrapper. Top with 1 or 2 Tb. of filling  and roll up, starting with the side of dough even with the edge of the foil  and leaving one end open. If using corn husks, tie with strip of husk.  Stack in steamer, open end up. Steam about one hour until dough does not  stick to wrapper. Serve warm or freeze for later use. Can be served with  warm chili sauce or salsa.
