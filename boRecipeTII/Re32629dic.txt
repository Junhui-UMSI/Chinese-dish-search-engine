Sweet Orange Tea #2
Water, Sugar, Glutinous rice flour, Water, Oranges, 
1. Peel oranges. Remove seeds and membranes over a bowl, to catch the  juice; then break pulp into small pieces. (Or cut oranges in half and, with  a small sharp spoon, scoop the pulp and juice into a bowl.)    2. Place glutinous rice flour in a bowl. Mix with a small amount of water  to form a stiff paste (add water gradually, one teaspoonful at a time).  Roll the paste into small (3/8-inch) balls.    3. Bring remaining water to a boil; then stir in sugar to dissolve. Drop  flour balls in and continue boiling until they float and are soft.    4. Stir in orange pulp and juice; cook only to heat through. Serve hot, in  small bowls. VARIATION: For the oranges, substitute 5 tangerines.
