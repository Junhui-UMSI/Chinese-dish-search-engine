Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl and  mix together holding  back on some of the flour until you see that it is needed. Knead dough 5-10  minutes or until dough is smooth. Cover and let rise until double in size.  Punch down and form into desired shapes-baquettes,round loaves etc. Bake at  375*  20-30 minutes depending on loaf size.
