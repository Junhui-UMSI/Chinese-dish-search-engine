These were originally posted by Virginia Sauer and are fantastic.    _EVERYONE_ loves this. In addition to being delicious, it reheats  perfectly, and is therefore ideal for covered dish, potluck, and buffet  dinners.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    Spread 1 tablespoon of the butter over bottom and sides of 1-quart  casserole. Set aside.    Pour carrots into 2-quart saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover carrots.  Cook over high flame until water comes to a boil. Lower flame to moderate  and continue cooking until carrots are barely tender when pierced with a  fork (about 6 minutes). Drain carrots in colander. Set aside until cool  enough to touch.    Pour 1/3 of the drained carrots into the bottom of the greased casserole.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Pour half of the remaining carrots  into a layer over the cheese. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Top  with remaining carrots. Set aside.    Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium-sized skillet. Add chopped onion. Saute  over low flame until golden (about 3 minutes). Sprinkle with flour, salt,  mustard, and pepper. Stir with wire whisk until mixture forms a paste.    Gradually add cream (while continuing to stir constantly). Cook until  thickened (consistency of a sauce). Pour over carrot-cheese mixture. Set  aside.    Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in small pan. Add bread crumbs. Cook,  stirring frequently, until golden brown. Sprinkle toasted bread crumbs  evenly over contents of casserole.    Place on center shelf of oven and bake 25 minutes. Serve hot.    Yield: 4 - 6 servings    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Mary Hathaway <paraducks1@JUNO.COM> on Mar 9,  1998
