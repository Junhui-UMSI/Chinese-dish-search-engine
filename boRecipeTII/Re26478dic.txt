Tomato Paste, Garlic
****  NO   E  *****, 
To store tomato paste: Most recipes for tomato-based pasta sauce call for a  single Tablespoon of tomato paste as a thickener. Heres a great way to  keep whats left over.    Using a hand-held can opener, open both ends of can, discard one.  Using  the stem of a spoon as a plunger against the other end, push paste out, in  its original shape, onto a piece of plastic wrap.    Score the paste into Tablespoon-size pieces (most cans contain  6 - 8  Tablespoon worth sizes).  Gently roll the plastic around the paste and  freeze.  When you need a single Tablespoon, just cut off a frozen slice.    No-stick Garlic: To keep garlic from sticking to your knife when you chop  it, sprinkle 1/4 tsp salt on the pieces as you go. The salt will absorb  moisture from the garlic, making it stick-free.  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n155    Date: Mon, 16 Sep 1996 22:25:41 -0700    From: Reggie Dwork <reggie@reggie.com>
