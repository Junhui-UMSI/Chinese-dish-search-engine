Texas Barbequed Beef Brisket
Ground black pepper, Paprika, onion, Boneless beef brisket, Butter, Catsup, Fresh Lemon Juice, Hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, 
Trim external fat on beef brisket to 1/4 inch.  Combine paprika and 1/2 tsp  of the black pepper; rub evenly over surface of beef brisket. Place  brisket, fat side down, in 11 1/2 X 9" disposable foil pan. Add 1 cup  water.  Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place in center of grid over  very low coals (use a single layer of coals with space in between each);  cover cooker.  Cook 5 - 6 hours, turning brisket over every 1 1/2 hours;  use baster to remove fat from pan as it accumulates. Add 1/2 cup water, if  needed, to pan during cooking. (Add just enough briquette during cooking to  keep coals at a very low temperature). Remove brisket from pan; place on  grid, fat side down, directly over very low coals. Reserve pan dripping.  Cover; continue cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour.    Meanwhile, skim fat from pan drippings; reserve 1 cup drippings. Melt  butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook until tender  crisp.  Add reserved pan drippings, remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper,  the catsup, lemon juice, worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce; simmer       15    minutes.    Carve brisket into thin slices across the grain; serve with sauce. Garnish  with fresh peppers and lemon and lime slices.    Note:  For a smokier flavor, soak oak, pecan, mesquite or hickory chips in  water 30 minutes and add to very low coals.    Source:  National Live Stock and Meat Board.
