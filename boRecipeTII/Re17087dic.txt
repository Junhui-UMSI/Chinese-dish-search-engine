Anyway, I thought you might be interested in a couple of my  favourite Indian recipes I have used for quite some time. They were part of  an Indian cookery course a friend attended. Neither recipe is particularly  hot as far as the ingredients go - but they taste pretty damned good and  you can always adjust the heat to your own liking:    1. Cut meat into pieces. Soak in yoghurt, salt, crushed garlic, ginger and        1    onion for about 1 hour    2. Slice the second onion. Heat the butter. Add onion and crushed poppy  seeds. Cook for a couple of minutes and then remove from heat. Add all the  remaining spices. Return to the heat, mix well and add meat and marinade.    3. cook over medium to low heat until the meat is cooked and yoghurt almost  dried up.    4. NB You can leave it as a gravy curry by cooking on a low heat to prevent  yoghurt from drying up...    5. NB Mustard oil works well for this dish.    6. if you prefer a less dry dish, add a can of tinned tomatoes and cook  until meat is tender or put in a suitable covered dish the oven at about      180 c  for       90    mins or so.
