This recipe is from "Grand Slam - More Recipes From The Best of Bridge".  Tried it last week and loved it!    Combine sauce ingredients and set aside. In a bowl, combine cornstarch,  sugar and salt. Add chicken and toss. Heat wok or frying pan to highest  heat. Add oil. Heat to hot, not smoking. Add chicken, ginger, garlic and  onion. Stir until chicken is opaque (about one minute). Add peppers and  carrots. Stir 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and sauce. Cook until it comes to a  boil. Add cashews and serve immediately. Serves 6.    I made a few adjustments because of the ingredients I had on hand. I dont  like too much garlic, just enough to flavour, so I only used about 1/2 tsp.  I didnt have snow peas so I used zucchini chunks. I didnt have cashews so  I just left these out. I also didnt have any cayenne so I used a dash of  hot pepper flakes. I also didnt have that much chicken so I compensated by  using more vegies.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 02 Feb 97 by Devon Rae Abrey <dabrey@NETCOM.CA> on  Feb 3, 1997.
