Raspberry Imperial Stout
Sugar (priming), Kent Goldings pellets, Gypsum, Chocolate malt, Sierra Nevada yeast, Roasted barley, English crystal malt, Bulk, light extract, Northern Brewer pellets (6, % alpha), Bullion pellets (9.6 alpha), Corn, Black patent malt, Fresh raspberries, 
This  makes 6-1/2 to 7 gallons. This is based on Papazians recipe  from  the  Summer  1990 issue of Zymurgy, except that I use  more  raspberries  than  Charlie.  Follow  his directions, or  E-mail  me  for  directions.    (Directions are pretty standard.) The Bullion hops and Northern Brewer are  used for  bittering  and  are added to the boil. The Kent Goldings pellets  are used for dry-hopping. This had a very strong raspberry taste with a  slightly coffee/dark  malt and hoppy/bitter aftertaste. The raspberry taste  is accompanied  by  a sort of astringency or acidity that will supposedly  soften  with  age. Its still very young for an Imperial stout.
