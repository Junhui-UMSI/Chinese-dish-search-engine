"Pollo Frito is a classic dish in Jewish Italy" (quote from the recipe)    Sprinkle chicken pieces evenly with salt pepper, nutmeg and garlic salt.  Place in bowl and refrigerate to marinate for several hours or overnight.  Toss once in a while to ensure evenness of seasoning.    Heat 1 cup of oil in a large skillet. Roll the chicken pieces in flour, dip  in egg and fry in the hot oil over high heat for 1 or 2 minutes. Lower heat  and fry for 15 minutes longer or until pieces are golden (but not brown) on  all sides serve with lemon wedges and riso colluvetta.
