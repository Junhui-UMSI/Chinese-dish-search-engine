submitted by: rayna@iconz.co.nz  Melt chocolate.  Stir till mixed and melted.  Break egg into pot.  Stir  with spatula till mixed. Add sugar slowly stirring. When thick, roll  chocolate into small balls large enough to accomodate an almond and a  cherry in the center of each chocolate ball. Roll in crushed nuts, cocoa or  roasted cocunut.    NOTE:  If you use a larger egg, you may need to alter the amount of icing  sugar.  Play it by ear to see.  Also if the chocolate mixture appears to be  thick enough and you still have sugar left - quit.    To keep working quickly - have bowls of cherries, almonds, cocoa and  coconut ready. You can keep a bowl of ice water ready to dip hands into so  chocolate didnt melt when working with it.
