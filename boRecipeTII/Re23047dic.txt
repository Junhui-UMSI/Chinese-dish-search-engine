Troys Scallops in Garlic Sauce
milk, Chardonnay Wine, Corn starch as required, olive oil, Fresh grated parmesan, Butter, Pasta-linquine or similar, Garlic, Frozen Scallops**save liquid, Garlic powder, Green onions, Fresh Basil, 
Defrost scallops, reserve liquid.  Fry scallops in olive oil, butter,  green onions and garlic and touch of basil.  Sprinkle garlic powder on top  of scallops.  When scallops are 1/2 cooked, add milk, basil (balance) and  reserved liquid. Simmer briefly (5-8 minutes).  Add wine, simmer 5  minutes.  Thicken with corn starch solution and serve.  Serve with pasta  (linguine or similar pasta).  Have some grated parmesan on side.    The dish just isnt the same if you toss out the liquid from the defrosted  scallops.  Dont overcook the dish!!!!
