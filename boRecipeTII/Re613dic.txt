This Neopolitan dish,produces a layered cake of sorts. The mozzarella  creates a generous middle layer, with serves as nice oozy contrast to the  potatoes. It is a great recipe, save it.    Preheat the oven to 350 F.    Boil the potatoes until tender, then drain. When they have cooled slightly,  peel then and pass them throuh a potato ricer, or use the masher.Mix in the  butter, milk, eggs and 1 tablespoon od grated cheese.    Butter a baking dish and sprinkle in half of the bread crumbs, making sure  they coat the surface entirely. Tap out any excess crumbs.    Spoon a half of the potato mixture into the dish, spreding it evenly. Top  with mozzarella,1 tablespoon of a grated cheese, and mushroom, then cover  with the rest of the potato.    Sprinkle the top withthe leftover bread crumbs, the final tablespoon of  grated cheese, and a little of paprika. Bake for 30 minutes. If the top  isnt golden brown, place the dish under the broiler for a few minutes. Let  rest for 10 minutes then serve.
