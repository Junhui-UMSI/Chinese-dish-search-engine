Mix all till smooth.    drop on greased baking sheet about a large serving spoon full at a time.  Bake each full for 8-10 min. Remove to rack and let cool.    Filling: whip till all is smooth.    Take and put together with cream filling in between two cakes. You can make  these small or large. Personally we like them small. Maybe two or so bites  each.
