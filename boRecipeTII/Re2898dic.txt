Chocolate bon bon Ice cream or other favorite flavor hard chocolate  topping: Make sure the ice cream is hard frozen. Melt 12 oz of semi-sweet  chocolate pieces and 1/2 cup margarine in the top part of a double boiler.  Remove from heat but keep warm over hot water. Use a fork to dip ice cream  balls into the chocolate, working as fast as possible. When youve dipped  about 10 - 12 pieces, place then in the freezer and continue the dipping.  After the chocolate is firm, you can wrap with foil or plastic wrap. For a  variation with vanilla ice cream, add 1 Tab instant coffee to the melted  chocolate. I have in a hurry, bought icecream at the market and with a  melon spoon dipped the ice cream out into small balls, frozen them hard and  then dipped in the chocolate as above. A quick delicious treat when you  want that something extra but dont have the time to spend making it or if  you have the time, after the first dipping and letting the chocolate freeze  hard, dip a second time.
