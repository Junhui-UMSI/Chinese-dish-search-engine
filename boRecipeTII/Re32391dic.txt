Put all in rice cooker and stir.  Put on cover and turn to COOK.  Will be  ready in about 45 minutes.  Can probably do this on the stove as well. Just  bring to a boil, turn down to low and simmer for 45 minutes.    From: Lucinda Rasmussen <lrasmuss@PICA.ARMY.MIL>. Fatfree Digest [Volume 9  Issue 29] July 20, 1994.
