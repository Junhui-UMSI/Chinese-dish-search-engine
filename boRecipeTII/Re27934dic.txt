Thousand-Year-Old Eggs
Very strong black tea, Ashes of charcoal and ashes, Fresh duck eggs, Each ashes of pine wood,, Lime*, Salt, From fireplace, 
These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the preserving  process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased individually in Oriental  markets.        Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg, thickly  coat each egg completely with this clay-like mix- ture. Line a large crock  with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top. Cover with more soil  and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to cure for 100 days. To remove  coating, scrape eggs and rinse under running water to clean thoroughly.   Crack lightly and remove shells. The white of the egg will appear a  grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk, when  sliced, will be a grayish-green color.        To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:        Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable        Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1  tablespoon minced ginger root.        *Available in garden stores and nurseries.        The description of the whites turning grayish isnt quite accurate from  the ones Ive seen. Theyre more a dark blackish amber color-- quite  attractive actually.
