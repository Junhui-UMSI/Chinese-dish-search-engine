Basic Fruit or Berry Yogurt Freeze: 1 cup fresh or frozen fruit, may be  doubled; such as berries; peaches or nectarines. Blend 1 tablespoon honey  and 1 cup plain yogurt.    Many fruits work well for frozen yogurt treats. Either mass or puree fruit  with a little honey or pure maple syrup. Add splash of water (or lemon  juice for a tangy taste); then add plain yogurt: regular, lowfat, or  nonfat. Blend again. You can add chopped walnuts or almonds, coconut  flakes, carob powder, or natural flavorings for variation. Pour mixture  into freezable cups or scoop into popsicle containers.    >DIET FOR ALL SEASONS, by Elson M.
