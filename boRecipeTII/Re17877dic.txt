In a  suitable bowl, combine potatoes, tumeric, salt, ground sesame seeds, lime  juice, half of the green coriander and water and mix thoroughly. In a small  pan heat mustard oil until hot; add cumin seeds and red chilies. Fry them  until brown and then add jalepeno pepper. Let it cook a minute or so. Pour  it over potatoes in the bowl and mix them thoroughly; garnish with  remaining green coriander leaves.
