Raisin Gems
Baking Powder, Raisins, Eggs, Cake Flour Sifted, Salt, Brown Sugar, Unsalted Butter Or Margarine, 
Cream the sugar and butter or margarine. Add eggs, one at a time, beating  well after each addition. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together. Add  to the creamed mixture alternately with the raisins. Mix well with each  addition of raisins.    Drop by teaspoonful onto a well-greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees  for 12 minutes. Run a spatula under cookies while still hot and cool on a  rack.    Coconut is a good substitute for the raisins.
