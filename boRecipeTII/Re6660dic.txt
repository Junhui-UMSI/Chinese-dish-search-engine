This dish is a specialty of the Stouffer Renaissance Mayflower Hotels Tino  Buggio, chef of the Nicholas restaurant. He was born in Italy, but grew up  in Dijon, France. This recipe reflects his fathers love of seafood.    Bring the chicken stock and 1 teaspoon of the olive oil to a boil. Add the  polenta and stir constantly with a wire whisk or wooden spoon for 5  minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.    Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the chopped shallot, crab meat,  Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, Angostura bitters, salt and pepper and  saute for 3 to 4 minutes to heat through. Remove from heat and add to the  polenta mixture.    Add the two eggs and Parmesan cheese and mix thoroughly.    Shape into round patties about 2 inches in diameter. Heat 1 tablespoon of  the remaining olive oil in a saucepan. Add crab cakes and cook over  medium-high heat for a total of about 3 minutes, or until brown on both  sides.
