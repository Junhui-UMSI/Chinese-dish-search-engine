POUR half and half into medium bowl. Add pie filling mix. Beat with wire  whisk until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Let stand 2 minutes or until  slightly thickened. Fold in whipped topping. Gently spread over gelatin  mixture. Place pastry leaves around rim of pie. Chill until firm, about 2  hours. Garnish with additional whipped topping and Frosted Cranberries, if  desired.
