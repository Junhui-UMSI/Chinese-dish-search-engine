According to Italian folklore, Puttanesca sauce  was created by "women of the evening." The sauce usually consisted of  tomatoes, olives, and garlic and had a heavenly aroma that would entice  clients to their doors. To serve, spoon tomato mixture over the steaks, and  garnish with olives and basil sprigs, if desired.
