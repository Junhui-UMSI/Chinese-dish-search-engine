Pork Tenderloins with Orange Pepper Sauce
Margarine or butter, Flour, Dry white wine, Orange juice, Shallot; chopped, Coarsely ground pepper, Pork tenderloin; trimmed of, Shredded orange peel, 
1.  Prepare the pork by cutting into 1/2-inch slices, then pounding between  2 sheets of waxed paper until about 1/4 inch thick. Dust lightly with the  flour. 2. In a wide skillet, melt the margarine over medium-high heat. Add  the pork, turning once, until browned on both sides. Do this step in stages  if pan isnt large enough to handle all the pork at once. When the pork is  browned on the outside, it should be thoroughly cooked through.  Remove to  a warmed serving platter, and keep warm in a 200 degree oven. 3. To the  drippings in the pan add the shallots and pepper.  Cook, stirring  occasionally, until the shallots wilt, then add the wine, orange peel, and  orange juice.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Cook until reduced to  1/2 cup or so.  Pour the sauce over the pork and serve.
