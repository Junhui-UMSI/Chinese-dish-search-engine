Its necessary to highly season turkey because the meat itself tastes  rather mild. Yet, once ground turkey is cooked up, its delicious. To  do a taste test on the mixture, make a little patty the size of a  silver dollar and pan-fry it in a nonstick skillet. This way you can  adjust your seasonings to taste. A mayonnaise-type dressing and  avacado make perfect toppings.    1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.    2. Place the ground turkey in a bowl and mix well with the scallions,  bell pepper, garlic, cilantro and spices. Season to taste with salt  and pepper. Gently form into 4 patties.    3. Grill patties over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 5-6 minutes  per side.    4. If desired, spread buns with mayonnaise-type dressing and top  burgers with avacado slices. Serve immediately.
