Copyright Washington Post    This recipe is adapted from a dish in the new "A Cozy Book of Breakfasts &  Brunches," by Jim Brown and Karletta Moniz (Prima, 1997). The authors  describe it as a savory bread pudding. We call it a make-ahead meal in a  dish.    In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the  mushrooms and onion, and cook until the onions are translucent, about 10  minutes. Remove from the pan and place in a medium bowl. In the same  skillet, heat the oil and brown the sausage, breaking it up until it is  crumbly. Drain well and add to the mushroom-onion mixture.    Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and cover the bottom with half the bread,  then half the mushroom-onion-sausage mixture, then half the cheese. Make  another layer with the remaining bread, mushroom-onion-sausage mixture and  cheese. In a medium bowl, mix the eggs, milk, mustard and nutmeg. Pour this  mixture over the layers in the baking dish. Cover and refrigerate  overnight.    The next day, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake, uncovered, for 1 hour,  until the top is brown and the eggs are completely set.
