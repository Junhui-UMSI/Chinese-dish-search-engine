Beef Brisket Bar-B-Q
Catsup, Onion, Pepper, Boneless beef brisket, Liquid smoke, Worcestershire Sauce, Vinegar, Salt, Bay leaf, 
Rub meat with salt. Place in ungreased baking dish (13x9x2). Stir together  remaining ingredients and pour over meat. Cover tightly with foil and bake  in slow oven (325 degrees) for 3 hours or until tender. Open foil during  the last 45 minutes to allow it to brown a bit.    Mary Anns note: I think the liquid smoke adds that Texan authenticity that  distinguishes this from the ordinary - and the long slow cooking.
