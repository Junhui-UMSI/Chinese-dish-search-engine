It is a  bit of work and it takes a long time to cook, but well worth it. I have  always gotten rave reviews on this one.    In a 6 qt or larger oven proof pot or Dutch oven with lid, heat the oil  over medium high heat.    Brown the meat on all sides and drain off any excess fat.    Mix together water, juice, honey, brown sugar, cinnamon and ginger and pour  over the meat. Cover, bring to a boil. Then lower the heat and simmer for  about 1-12 hours.    Preheat oven to 325 towards the end of this period.    Randomly arrange the carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, prunes and appricots  around and on top of the meat.    Cover the pot and transfer to the preheated oven. Bake for 1-1/2 hours.  Then uncover the pot and bake for an additional 1 to 2 hours or until the  meat is fork tender.    Use a slotted spoon to remove the vegetables and fruit to a serving bowl.  Transfer the meat to a platter or carving board.    If the sauce in the pan is too thin, use a mixture of cornstarch and cold  water (shake them together in a tupperware) to thicken the sauce. To do  this, put the pan over a medium heat on the stove, stir in some of the  cornstarch mixture, and boil until it reaches the desired consistency.    Cut the meat against the grain, pour some of the sauce over the top, and  serve with the vegetables and fruit.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 302    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
