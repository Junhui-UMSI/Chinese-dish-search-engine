This may be cooked a day ahead and refridgerated overnight. Skim fat off  top and reheat.    Place beef in slow-cooker.  Combine remaining ingredients, except rolls.  Pour over meat.  Cover and cook on LOW 8-9 hours. Refridgerate or prepare  sandwiches now.  Shred beef by pulling it apart with two forks; add 1 cup  sauce.  Reheat in microwave or on stovetop. Spoon on warm, open-face rolls  or buns. Top with additional warm sauce, if desired.    Crockery Favorites, Mable Hoffman
