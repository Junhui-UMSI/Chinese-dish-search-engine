Thai Fresh Cucumber Salad (Taeng Kwa Brio Wan
Sugar; dissolved in:, Minced red onion; -OR-, -Minced scallions   (Opt.), Dried hot pepper flakes, Cucumbers; sliced as thinly, as possible *, White vinegar, Salt, -Hot water, 
*Note: The book says to peel the cucumbers only if they are waxed and even  then leave on a few strips.  I say to remove all the peel if its been  waxed.  Yuck.    In a bowl, generously salt the sliced cucumbers. Allow to sit for at least  30 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Combine the other ingredients.    Squeeze out as much of the cucumber juice as you can, by wringing a handful  at a time in a double layer of cheesecloth or a dish towel. Twist until you  can extract no more juice.    Combine the squeezed cucumbers and the sauce in a serving bowl and  refrigerate until ready to serve.    Source: Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant Typed for you by Karen Mintzias
