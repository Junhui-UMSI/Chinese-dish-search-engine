Vodka, Cinnamon; ground, Mint; dried flakes, Cardamom; ground, Vanilla bean; chopped, Cloves; ground, Sugar, Orange peel; grated, Instant coffee; fresh jar, Water, OPTIONAL FLAVORINGS, 
Boil water & sugar together until dissolved & clear. Turn off heat. Slowly  add instant coffee & continue stirring. When well mixed let cool to room  temperature. While the coffee mixture cools, add vanilla bean to the vodka.  When the coffee mixture is cooled add to the vodka mixture. Cover tightly &  shake vigorously each day for 3 weeks. Strain & filter.    Yield: About 4 cups    Dona & Mel have this to say about Kahlua:    The Mexican "Kahlua" & Jamaican "Tia Maria" are probably the best known  coffee flavored liqueurs. Other companies produce similar drinks called  Moka, Mocha, Creme de Mocha, & so forth. Coffee is among the easiest  flavors to simulate. We recieved many recipes from our friends that varied  only slightly from one another. It seemed that everyone had made a version  of "Kahlua" at one time & treasured his own recipe.    VARIATION: Substitute rum for the vodka to yeild a simulated "Tia Maria".  Substitute brandy for the vodka for another simulated "Kahlua".    Formatted by cea260@airmail.net Christopher E. Eaves    Chris Notes: I like to use the vodka version with a pinch of cardamom.  Experimenting with this recipe I have found that instead of throwing out a  partial pot of coffee, save it in a tightly covered container in the fridge  until you get 2 cups worth. Then use it in place of the water & delete the  instant coffee. (Very FRUGAL considering the price of good coffee these  days!)
