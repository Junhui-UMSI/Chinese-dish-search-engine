Garlic Green Beans
Green beans, Oil; (up to 2), Salt, Garlic, Soy sauce, Water, 
source: Quick and Easy Kosher Cooking published by the H.O.C. sisterhood,  South Bend, IN    Put oil in a skillet and season with salt. Heat oil and stir fry garlic for  two minutes. Add beans and stir fry for two more minutes. Add soy sauce and  water. Cover and cook for 10 to 25 minutes over low flame.    note: Original cooking time was five minutes. I usually simmer the beans  for closer to 30 minutes. It depends on how firm or soft you like them. The  beans will shrink quite a bit, as well.
