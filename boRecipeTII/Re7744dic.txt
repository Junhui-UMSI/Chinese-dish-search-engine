Port-Poached Pears with Stilton Custard
Egg yolk, Pears, Port Wine, Stilton Cheese, Vanilla extract, Sugar, Sugar, milk, 
In a 3- to 4-quart pan, bring port and 1/2 cup of the sugar to a boil over  high heat.  Add pears, cover, and simmer until pears are tender when  pierced, 10 to 15 minutes.  Turn pears over halfway through cooking. Lift  pears from syrup to a bowl. Over high heat, boil syrup, uncovered, until  reduced to 1/2 cup, 15 to 20 minutes.  Pour over pears, and let cool. Cover  and chill until cold, at least 2 hours or until the next day.  After 1  hours turn pears over in syrup. In a bowl, lightly whisk together yolk and  the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.  In a 1- to 2-quart pan, heat milk until  scalding, stirring often. Gradually whisk milk into yolk and sugar. Return  mixture to pan.  Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until  custard thickly coats back of metal spoon, about 3 minutes.  Add Stilton;  stir just until cheese melts. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Let  cool, then cover and chill until cold, at least 2 hours, or until next day.  To serve, turn pears over in syrup, then lift them from syrup and set on 4  small rimmed plates.  Carefully spoon syrup over half of each pear and  cheese custard over other half.
