Until       recently it       was known only to Chinese grocers and cooks, but its appeal has       spread, and       many supermarkets now carry the vegetable. It has two great       advantages: It       steams whole to beautifully decorate a party plate and in the       microwave, it       speeds to such a rapid crunchy doneness, you scarcely turn around       and its       ready. It can be simply wilted and buttered, oiled, sauced with       soy, or       included in a stir-fry.
