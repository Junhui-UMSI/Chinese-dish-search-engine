Pumpkin Spice Drops with Lemon Icing
Nuts, Chopped, Flour, Sifted, Raisins, Solid Pack Pumpkin, Ginger, Baking Powder, Sugar, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Salt, Shortening, Eggs, 
Preheat Oven 350. Cream shortening, add sugar gradually. Add eggs, and  pumpkin, mix well. Sift flour, baking powder, salt and spices together. Add  to pumpkin mixture and mix until blended.    Add rasins and nuts. Drop by teaspoon onto pam coated cookie sheet. Bake  about 15 mins. Cool on rack, frost with Lemon Icing. These freeze well.    Lemon Icing: Combine 2 cups confectioners sugar with 1 Tablespoon each  lemon juice and grated lemon rind. Add just enough cream to make it spread  smooth. If stiff add more cream little at a time until spreads smooth.    I usually bake these on my baking stone. I like the warm soft bottoms  without a hard crusty edge.
