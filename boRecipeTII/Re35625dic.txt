From: Stacey Silva <ssilva@skat.usc.edu>    Date: Mon, 7 Mar 1994 18:35:44 GMT  Here is a recipe for an Easter dessert that my family makes.  Sift flour  and baking powder together. Beat eggs with oil. Make a well in the dry  ingredients, and add egg and oil until blended.  Roll into long, thin  ropes. (Thickness of your pinky finger, about 1/4".) Cut ropes into pieces  about 1/4" to 1/2". Deep fry until light golden. Drain.    Warm honey.  (This can be done in the microwave.) Mix  with warm dough  balls and sprinkles to coat.    This makes a LARGE amount of the balls, these can be frozen or stored in an  airtight container and then topped Later.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
