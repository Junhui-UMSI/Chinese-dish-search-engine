All-Day Apple Butter
Cinnamon, Ground cloves, Salt, Apples; peeled and finely, Sugar, 
Place apples in a crock pot. Combine sugar, cinnamon, cloves and salt; pour  over apples and mix well. Cover and cook on high for 1 hour. Reduce heat to  low; cover and cook for 9-11 hours or until thickened and dark brown,  stirring occasionally (stir more frequently as it thickens to prevent  sticking). Uncover and cook on low 1 hour longer. If desired, stir with a  wire whisk until smooth. Spoon into freezer containers, leaving 1/2-inch  headspace. Cover and refrigerate or freeze.
