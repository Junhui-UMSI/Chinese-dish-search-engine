Cream the sugar and butter with an electric mixer until light.  Add the  eggs and mix well. On low speed, mix in the bananas, milk, and vanilla.  Stop the mixer and add the flour, baking soda and salt. Mix until just  combined, then stir in the mini chocolate chips and nuts.    3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in  the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan 5 minutes;  turn onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.    NOTE:  Mini chocolate chips work better than regular chips because the  regular size ones tend to sink to the bottom of the loaf during baking.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
