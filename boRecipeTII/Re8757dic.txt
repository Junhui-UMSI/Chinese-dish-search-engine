Pousse Caf?
Creme de menthe, Grenadine, Yellow chartreuse, Creme Yvette, 
Into a Pousse Caf? glass, carefully pour equal parts of the above  ingredients in order shown so that each ingredient floats on top of  preceding one. The liquids will float more readily if you gently pour each  liquid over the back of a spoon resting on top of the glass.    Recipe By     : Joe Robertson
