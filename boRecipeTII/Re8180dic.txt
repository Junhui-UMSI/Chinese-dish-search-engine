Potato Dumplings (Kartoffelknodel)
Nutmeg, Eggs, Stale bread, Salt, Flour, Margarine, Baking potatoes, 
Boil potatoes until tender. Cover and refrigerate 12-24 hours. Finely chop  or mash the cooked potatoes. In a medium bowl, mix potatoes, 1 C flour, and  next 3 ingredients to form a firm but light paste. If mixture is too moist  add flour as needed. This will help keep the dumplings from falling apart  during cooking.    Melt margarine in skillet. Add bread cubes and saute till brown. Working  with floured hands, form the potato mixture into a roll about 2 1/2 inches  in diameter. Cut roll into 8-10 pieces and form each into a dumpling,  enclosing a few sauteed bread crumbs in the center of each.    Boil dumplings in water, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Do not  cover. Simmer over low heat about 15 minutes; dumplings are done when they  float.    Both recipes are from THE BEST OF GERMAN COOKING, by Edda Meyer- Berkhout.
