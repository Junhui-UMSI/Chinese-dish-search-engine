Brown Sugar, milk, Flaked or shredded coconut, Lemon juice, Bananas; sliced, Powdered sugar, Half-and-half, French bread; sliced about, Eggs, Vanilla extract, 
Arrange half the bread in the bottom of a greased 9-inch square baking  pan. In a bowl, toss the bananas, coconut and lemon juice. Distribute  evenly over the bread layer. Top with the remaining bread.     In a bowl, beat the eggs and the brown sugar. Beat in half-and-half, milk  and vanilla to blend thoroughly. Pour over the bread. Press bread down  slightly to saturate completely.     Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven until the bread is browned and the  custard is set, 45-55 minutes. Cool slightly, then dust with powdered  sugar. Garnish with additional bnanan slices, if desired.     Serve warm, perhaps topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
