Source: Jewish cooking class taught by Bilha Widmann    1. Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly.    2. Put the rice into a pot, and cover with water such that the water level  is 4 cm [1.5 inches] above the rice. Add the lemon juice, bring to a boil,  and let cook for 8 minutes. Drain, and chill the rice.    3. In another pot, heat the oil. Layer the potato slices at the bottom of  the pot. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, coriander, and turmeric.    4. Divide the rice into 3 parts. Put 1 part on top of the potatoes, and top  with half the almonds, pistachios, prunes, and orange peel. Top with the  next part of rice, and then with the rest of the almonds, pistachios,  prunes, and orange peel. Then top with the last part of rice.    5. Cover the pot, and cook at a low heat for 30 - 40 minutes, until the  rice is tender to the touch. Do not uncover the pot until at least 30  minutes has gone by; the steam is important in the cooking process.    6. Put the rice on a platter and serve. The crusty potato layer formed at  the bottom during cooking may be put under the rice or served separately  (and fought over! Even if its blackened, its worth eating!).    * All ounce amounts are ounces by weight, NOT volume.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #062 by Karen Snyder  <100130.1562@CompuServe.COM> on 97.
