Wehani rice is a hybrid of brown rices developed at Lundberg  Family Farms in California (www.lundberg.com). Its a light clay color and  splits a little when cooked. Wehani rice is nutty and unhulled, kind of  chewy, and it has some texture to it, Stehling says. Its a nice pairing  with the smooth, cool avocado." -- AB    Hanneman: Recipes provided by "Ann Burger" <www.charleston.net/> on July  30, 1997,     Recipe by: Robert Stehling, Chef    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Kitpath <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on May 17,  1998
