Bake 10 minutes    For Filling: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and flour at medium speed with mixer  until well blended.  Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each  addition. Blend in sour cream and vanilla. Pour over prepared crust. Bake 1  hour and 10 minutes. Turn off oven and prop door open and let cheesecake  sit in oven until oven has cooled. Lossen cake from rim of pan. Can be  topped with fruits or whipped cream as desired. (I think it tastes best  when refrigerated over night.)
