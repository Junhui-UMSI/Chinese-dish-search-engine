Notes: The Kitchen Table BBS - http://www.mindsync.com/ChefJeff "I spent  some time as the Chef at Ruby Tuesdays Cafe in Sutter Creek, California a  few years back. The owner of the place, Ray, had a wonderful recipe for  lemon bread that has been re-printed in both Gourmet and Bon Apetit  Magazines. It is some work, but worth every minute of effort.--Jeff  Hanneman/Buster/Mcrecipe 1998-Apr-06    Recipe by: Ruby Tuesdays Cafe, Sutter Creek, CA    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by KitPATh <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on Apr 06,  1998
