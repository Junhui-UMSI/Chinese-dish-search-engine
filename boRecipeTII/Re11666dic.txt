Raspberry Vinaigrette - Pete and Pat Marsh
White vinegar, Sugar, (1#) fresh raspberries, 
Put berries in a jar and pour the vinegar over. Let stand for 6 days,  shaking up once a day. At the end of the 6th day, strain the mixture to  remove solids; bring liquid to a boil adding the sugar and tasting for  sweetness before adding the whole amount of sugar. Boil for 1 minute or so.  Pour in cruet or empty, cleaned salad dressing bottle. Made about 1 1/4  salad dressing bottles. Pete likes best on fresh spinach leaves and sliced  almonds. Much better than commercial dressings.
