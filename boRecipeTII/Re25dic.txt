Jeffs Swiss Steak
Round steak, Flour, Garlic powder, Salt, Cooking oil, Tomato Sauce, Tomato Paste, Whole tomatoes, Onion, Green bell pepper, Worcestershire Sauce, Lemon juice, Pepper, 
This is one of those "precious" recipes that my mother used to cook.  After tenderizing the round steak, dredge in mixture of the flour, garlic  powder and salt.  Brown the outside of the meat quickly in hot oil.  Add the onions, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, tomato paste, tomato  sauce, pepper and tomatoes (if desired, chop as they cook).    Add water if  necessary to cover the meat.      Simmer for 2 hours on low heat.      Add the bell pepper and cook an additional 15-20 minutes.    Serve with mashed potatoes and rolls.      Bell pepper may be increased to 1/2 cup if desired.
