Poor Mans Cake
Baking Powder, Baking soda, Nutmaeg, Flour, Cinnamon, Water, Raisins, Water, Brown sugar, Vegetable shortening *, Cloves, Salt, 
(the name comes from the fact that the cake calls for no eggs, no milk, and  no butter)    *NOTE:  (Since the shortening is melted, I substituted Canola oil, thus, I  think, saving a LOT of cholestrol and saturated fats!)    Boil brown sugar, 1 1/4 C water, oil or shortneing, raisins and spices  together for three minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.    Add salt and baking soda, dissolved in 2 tsp water. Sift together flour and  baking powder, add gradually, beating after each addition.    Grease and flour 8" square pan.  (I used nonfat spray instead).    Bake at 325 for approximately 50 minutes, until it tests done.    Needs no frosting.    (would be HEAVENLY with a big blob of whipped cream...but its really  unnecessary.  this sucker is GOOD!)
