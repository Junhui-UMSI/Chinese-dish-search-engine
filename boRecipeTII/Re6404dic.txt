For the dough: In a mixing bowl with a paddle blend together flour, sugar  and lemon zest. Add butter and continue mixing on low until sandy looking.  Meanwhile whisk together egg and yolk. Add to flour/butter mixture and  blend on low just until it comes together. Form into a ball and chill.    Roll dough out to a 14-inch circle and place on a parchment paper lined  sheet pan. Fold over 1/2- inch of the crust to form a rustic edge. Spread  jam on center of tart then fan around wedges of plums and dot with  raspberries. Drizzle honey over plums, brush edge with cream and sprinkle  with coarse sugar. Bake at 375 degrees until fruit is tender and crust is  cooked on the under side, about 25 to 30 minutes.    Note: You may use frozen raspberries if fresh is not available. Also if you  cant find coarse sugar, use raw sugar.
