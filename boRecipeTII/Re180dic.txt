Labaneh
Yoghurt, 
Use natural yoghurt or home made yoghurt.   Take cloth, put the whole amount of yoghurt in it and hang it over night over your kitchen sieve.   By the next morning the amount should have reduced to half.    You get "dehydrated" yoghurt, a sour, extremely refreshing and very healthy "cream cheese" which is used as is, eaten with the addition of a little olive oil, an oriental  herbs mix called "Zaatar", with the addition of a little salt.    Keep this recipe for "aubergines with Labane" which I will post the next  time.
