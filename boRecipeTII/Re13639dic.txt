Shiitake mushrooms, Broth, Mascarpone cheese, Chopped parsley, White mushrooms, onion, Arborio rice, Black Pepper, Salt, Grated Parmesan cheese, Vegetable oil, Unsalted butter, Dry white wine, Unsalted butter, 
You can substitute dried wild mushrooms for the shiitake. Just soak them  for 15-to-20 minutes beforehand (and be sure to add the strained soaking  liquid to the stock). HEAT BUTTER in small skillet over moderate heat. When  it begins to foam, add mushrooms and cook for 3-to-5 minutes, until soft.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off heat and set aside. Bring the broth  to a steady simmer in a saucepan on top of the stove. Heat butter and oil  in heavy 4-quart casserole over moderate heat. Add onion, saute for 1-to-2  minutes, until it begins to soften, being careful not to brown. Add rice to  butter-oil-onion mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir 1 minute, making sure  all grains are well coated. Add wine and stir until completely absorbed.  Add simmering broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until  each addition is almost completely absorbed (approximately 2 minutes)  before adding next 1/2 cup, reserving 1/4 cup to add at the end. Stir  often. After approximately 18 minutes (rice should be tender and firm), add  1/4 cup broth, mushrooms, Mascarpone and Parmesan cheeses and stir  vigorously so cheeses melt. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.
