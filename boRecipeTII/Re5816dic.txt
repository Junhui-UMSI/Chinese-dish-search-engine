Pinto Beans with Potatoes
Potatoes, Celery, Peanut oil, Salt, Dried pinto beans, Onion, 
Cover pinto beans with enough water to cover & bring to a boil. Reduce heat  & simmer until they are just tender. Add potatoes, celery & salt & more  water if necessary. Cook over low heat. Just before the potatoes & beans  are tender, gently fry the onions in a heavy skillet. Using a slotted  spoon, add the beans to the skillet & stir until well mixed & heated  through.  Serve hot over rice or a stiff porridge. *This dish traditionally  uses manioc (casava) in place of the potatoes. If you can get it, use it.
