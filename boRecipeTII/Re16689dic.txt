Alaska Seafood Tarts
Packet filo pastry, Plain flour, Greek yogurt, Seafood sticks; chopped, Walnut oil, Canned pink Alaska salmon, Margarine, Walnuts, chopped, Grated Parmesan, 
Pre-heat oven to 80 C, 350 F, Gas mark 4. Lightly grease 8 individual pie  dishes or ovenproof pudding bowls.    Drain the can of salmon and make the juice up to 200ml / 7fl.oz. with water  for fish stock. Flake the salmon. Set aside.    Brush each individual sheet of filo pastry with oil and fold into sixteen  12.5cm / 5inch squares. Put one square into each pie dish leaving the  pointed corners protruding over the edge. Brush with oil then put a second  square of pastry onto the first, but with the corners pointing up in  between the original ones to create a water lily effect. Brush the points  well with oil then bake for 5 minutes to set but not brown. Take out of the  oven.    Reduce the oven temperature to 150 C, 300 F, Gas mark 2. Melt the margarine  and stir in the flour. Blend in the fish stock, beating well to remove  lumps. Stir the yogurt, seafood sticks, walnuts and flaked salmon into the  sauce and divide equally between the 8 pastry cases.    Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the top then return to the oven to heat  through for 5-8 minutes or until the cheese and pastry have turned golden  brown. Serve immediately.
