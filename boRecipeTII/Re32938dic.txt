Sweet Stuffed Sweets

Herea recipe I like and Im not big on sweet potatoes. It comes from the  cookbook, Lean and Luscious and Meatless by Bobbi Hinman and Millie Snyder.    These delicious pineapple-flavored sweet potatoes can be stuffed a day  ahead and baked when needed.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees> Prick sweet potatoes several times with a  sharp knife and bake them 45 minutes, or until tender.    Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the pulp with a spoon,  leaving a 1/4" shell. In a medium bowl, combine potato pulp with crushed  pineapple, vanilla, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Mix with a fork until well  blended. Divide mixture evenly and fill the potato shells, smoothing the  tops with the back of a spoon.    Sprinkle with pecan (if desired), pressing them gently into the potatoes.  combine wheat germ and cinnamon and sprinkle evenly over potatoes.    Place potatoes in a shallow baking pan. Bake 15 minutes.    Each serving provides:      125    calories,        2 g  protein, 0 fat,       29 g  carbohydrate,       13 mg sodium, 0 mg cholesterol.
