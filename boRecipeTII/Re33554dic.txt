Swedish Brown Bread
Dark molasses, Flour, Water, Salt, Dry yeast, Bacon fat, milk, Sugar, 
In saucepan, mix water, milk, bacon fat and molasses. Heat to lukewarm.  Sift 4 cups flour, sugar and salt together. Sprinkle yeast over this. Add  the lukewarm mixture and beat with a mixer until smooth. Gradually add  enough of remaining 5 cups flour, to form a stiff dough. Knead on a floured  surface until dough is no longer sticky. Put the dough in a greased bowl,  and place in a warm place until it has doubled in bulk. Punch down, knead,  and shape into 4 loaves. Place in greased loaf pans and let rise again  until double in bulk, about 1 to 1-1/2 hour. Cover and bake at 325 degrees  for 1 hour. Remove from oven. Brush tops with melted multer and allow to  stand for 5 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
