Chateaubriand with Artichokes And Bearnaise Sauce
Bearnaise sauce, Beef tenderloin roast;, Salt, Artichokes, Pepper, cracked black;, 
Prepare the artichokes; cut off the stem and cut off two-thirds of the  tops, leaving at least one-inch bottoms. Cook the bottoms; then cool them  slightly, and with a spoon scoop out and discard the fuzzy "chokes". Return  the artichokes to the cooking liquid and keep them warm.    Prepare coals of grill:  place coals on each side so that the meat is not  directly over medium hot coals. Rub pepper over the beef loins, then  sprinkle with salt. Grill until a meat thermometer registers 145 F. (medium  rare).    To serve, with a slotted spoon, remove the artichoke bottoms from the  cooking liquid, and drain them on paper towels.  Spoon some bearnaise sauce  into the center of the artichokes. Slice the meat thickly; arrange the meat  on the center of a warm platter and surround with the stuffed artichokes.
