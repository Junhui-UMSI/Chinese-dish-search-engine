Pumpkin Superstew
Salt or to taste, Vegetable stock or water, Green bell pepper; cored,, Fresh-cut diced tomatoes, Onion; coarsely chopped, Coarsely diced celery, Red bell pepper; cored,, Fresh or frozen green beans;, Mild chili powder, Fresh-ground black pepper, Garlic, Peeled and diced pumpkin; or, Fresh or frozen corn, olive oil, 
Heat a large skillet or Dutch oven over high heat and add the olive oil.  When the oil is hot, add the cubes of pumpkin and saute for 5 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Add the onion, celery and garlic and saute for  another 5 minutes or until the onion becomes soft. Add the green and red  bell peppers, tomatoes, corn, green beans, stock or water, chili powder,  pepper and salt and cook, covered, over low heat for 25 minutes or until  the vegetables are tender. (6 servings).    If you visit a co-op or health-food store, look in the bulk section for  vegetarian chicken broth. Its made with brewers yeast and tastes very  much like a homestyle chicken stock. It will add another layer of flavor to  this dish. For the tomatoes, try to find the relatively new "fresh cut"  canned ones from Del Monte or Hunts. Theyre firmer than most. I like to  serve this on a bed of cooked, buttered quinoa. Quinoa, which can be found  in health-food stores, is an ancient grain used by the Incas. It has a very  high protein content and a lovely rich flavor.    As with many stews, this will taste even better the day after cooking.
