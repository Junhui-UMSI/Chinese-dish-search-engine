Hi all, here is that recipe I promised, it is from a very old issue of  Weight Watchers, I pulled out the pages so I dont know the year, I just  remember it being an old magazine!    1) Sort and wash beans, and place in a medium saucepan. Cover with water 2  inches above beans, and bring to a boil; cook 2 minutes. Remove from heat,  and let stand, covered , 1 hour. Drain beans and set aside.    2) Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-low heat until hot. Add diced  onion, celery, and carrot, and saute 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat, and cook  15 minutes. (Do not brown.) Add beans, 3 quarts water, salt and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 2 1/2 hours or until  beans are tender. Discard bay leaf.    3) Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    4) Remove outer covering of whole garlic heads. Do not peel or separate  cloves. Wrap each head in aluminum foil. Bake at 350 for 1 hour; let cool  10 minutes. Separate cloves, and squeeze garlic pulp into a bowl; discard  skins.    5) Place 1 cup bean mixture, garlic pulp and pepper in food processor bowl,  and process until smooth. Add to remaining bean mixture in Dutch oven; stir  well. Cover and cook over low heat 10 minutes. Add parsley and remaining  ingredients; stir well. Yield: 11 (1-cup) servings.
