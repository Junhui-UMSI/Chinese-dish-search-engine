Peel the plantains.  Put them in a saucepan, cover them with water, and  boil until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash until smooth. Stir  in 1/2 c sugar and the nutmeg, vanilla and a drop or 2 of red food coloring  (opt).    Preheat oven to 400 degrees, Roll out pie dough and cut into 8 circles that  are 4-5 inches across (use a saucer or small plate as a guide). Divide the  plantain mixture among the 8 dough circles, placing it on side and leaving  a 1/2 inch border. Fold the other half of the circle over the filling to  form a crescent shape. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal well. Sprinkle  with sugar. Bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 30-45 minutes, until  lightly browned.  Cool on wire racks, and serve warm or cold.
