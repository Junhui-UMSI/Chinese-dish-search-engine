Chris, man I gotta tell ya, we dont do crawfish bisque too much around  here, its just too much trouble, but if you want one, my Gramma has one:    Squish the bread in the milk and set aside.    Chop up the tails real fine, add big onions, bell pepper, oil, butter and  fat in a big ole pan and simmer until vegetables are cooked, add bread/milk  stuff. Add parsley, garlic, green onions and any other seasoning a good  chile head would add at this point. Stuff the heads. Roll em in flour and  bake em for a while, dont burn the heads. The flour should turn a little  brown. Freeze em if you like. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #267 by Gary  Johnson <gjohnso@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu> on Mar 18, 1997
