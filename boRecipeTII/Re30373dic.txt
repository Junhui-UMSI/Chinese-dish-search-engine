Banana Cream Puffs Ala Steve
Butter or margarine, *Pastry*, Flour, Water, Salt, Eggs, 
Put water, salt and butter in saucepan; bring to boil. When boiling,  add flour all at once and stir until it leaves the edges. Remove from  heat and let cool about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating  each time until the dough no longer looks slippery. Grease a cookie  sheet and drop dough in small amounts, about 2 tsp. Bake in preheated  400F oven for 10 minutes and without removing, lower heat to 350 and  bake about 25 minutes longer.  Cool.    *Filling* 2 cups whipping cream 2 tbsp sugar 2 large ripe bananas 2  tbsp Kahlua    Whip cream (on highest setting) until soft peaks form. Gradually add  sugar, whipping until stiff. Mash bananas to make one cup (I use a  potatoe masher) and fold into whipped cream along with Kahula.    Slice pastry in half and fill.    *Topping* 5 oz semi sweet chocolate (about 4-5 squares) 1/4 cup butter    Melt butter and chocolate together and drizzle over top! TRY TO WAIT  UNTIL THE CHOCOLATE COOLS BEFORE SCARFFING THESE DOWN!    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
