Struffoli (Italian Honey Cookies)
Baking Powder, Oil for frying, Flour, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Honey, Butter, sugar, Colored sprinkles, Eggs, 
Here is the recipe,unfortunately not T.nt (sdm-marked), but from one of my favorite  cookbooks: "Ciao Italia" by Mary Ann Sposito    In a bowl,whisk together the eggs,butter,and 1 t sugar until foamy. Sift  the flour with the baking powder and stir into the egg mixture.With your  hands work the mixture into a soft douhg. Divide the dough into 4 pieces.    On a floured surface,roll ea piece into a rope about the width of your  index finger and 12" long. Cut the ropes into 1" pieces.    Toss the pieces with enough flor to dust them lightly, and shake off the  exces flour.    In a deep fryer, heat the oil to 375 . Fry the struffoli a few handfulls at  atime, until puffed up and golden brown.    Tranfer with a slotted spoon to brown paper to drain.    In a large saucepan, combine the honey and the 1/2 cup sugar and heat over  low heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved,Keep warm over low heat.  Add the fried balls a little at a time, and turn them to coat all sides.  Transfer them to a large plate and mound them into a pyramid shaping it  with wet hands.    Sprinkle with the colored sprinkles and let stand 1 to 2 hours. Break  pieces with your hand to eat.
