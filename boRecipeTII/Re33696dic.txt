Remove from mixer; stir in nuts. Spoon into small  bowl. Refrigerate.    Heat oven to 400 degrees. Brush a muffin tin heavily with melted butter.  Heat the tin in oven. Watch so butter does not burn.    Put milk, eggs, vanilla and salt into electric mixer. Beat until well  mixed. With mixer running, slowly add flour, nutmeg and cinnamon. Beat  slowly until well mixed.    Remove cheese-nut mixture from refrigerator. Remove muffin tin from oven.  Fill hot muffin cups about 1/2 to 2/3 of the way full with batter. Gently  drop about 1 teaspoon of cheese-nut mixture into center of each filled  muffin cup.    Bake until puffed and golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Serve immediately.
