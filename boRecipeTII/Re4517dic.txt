Pesto-Swirled Bread
Vegetable cooking spray, All-purpose flour, divided, Egg, lightly beaten, Dry yeast, Water, Salt, olive oil, Semolina, (pasta flour), Sugar, Warm water, 105 to 115, Basil Pesto, 
Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5  minutes. Add semolina, salt, and oil; beat at medium speed of a mixer until  smooth. Stir in 2 cups all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn dough  out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about  10 minutes); add enough of the remaining flour, one tablespoon at a time,  to prevent dough from sticking to hands.    Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 45  minutes or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and turn out onto a  lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half; roll each portion into an 11  x 7-inch rectangle. Spread 3 tablespoons of the Basil Pesto over center of  each rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch margin around edges. Roll up each  rectangle, starting with a long edge, pressing firmly to eliminate air  pockets; pinch seam and ends to seal. Place rolls, seam sides down, in a  baguette pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 45 minutes or  until doubled in bulk.    Uncover dough. Combine egg and 1 tablespoon water; stir well, and brush  over loaves. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes or until loaves sound  hollow when tapped. Remove from pan, and let cool on wire racks. Yield: 2  loaves, 16 servings per loaf.
