Poor Mans Steak
olive oil, Garnish (see instr), Eggplant, 
Another eggplant recipe - adapted from the Romagnolis    Slice eggplant about 1/4 inch thick across - use Sicilian eggplant if  possible, otherwise, salt it and let it drain for an hour    anoint with olive oil and put it on the grill oiled side down or annoint  both sides and put it under the broiler on a cookie sheet.    On the grill, anoint the up side.    When it starts to brown turn it over,  oiling the now top side    If you are using the grill you can now put topping on - anchovies, tomato  sauce, olive paste, sage leaves, cheese,  if using the broiler, pull out  when they start to brown, top and run under the broiler for another minute.    Great appetizers or side dish, transcendant in sandwiches the next day.    For extra pizazz, crush herbs in the oil a few minutes before anointing the  eggplant.  Serve the herbed oil with.    I once had to transport a batch of this, mixed toppings, to a wake.  I  stacked it up like pancakes. The flavoured oil which accumulated at the  bottom had people fighting for bread to sop it up.
