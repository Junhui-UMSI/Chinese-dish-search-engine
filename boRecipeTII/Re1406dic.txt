Elegant Chocolate Dipped Apricots
Chocolate chips, Dried apricots, Whole almonds; shelled, 
Put the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl and melt them in the  microwave. For each dried apricot, find the hole on one end where the pit  was removed, and stuff an almond inside. Then dip that end into the melted  chocolate, about half-way. Lay the apricot on a wax paper lined cookie  sheet. Continue until you run out of apricots, nuts or chocolate! When the  chocolate dries, store the dipped apricots in an airtight container.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by syschwartz@juno.com (Sarah J Schwartz) on  Aug 29, 1998,
