Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper; secure with masking tape, and  set aside.    Beat egg whites (at room temperature) and salt in a bowl at high speed of a  mixer until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time,  beating until stiff peaks form (do not underbeat). Add vanilla, and beat  until blended.    Spoon meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe into 60  portions onto prepared baking sheet, forming pointed mounds 1 inch wide and        1    inch high.    Bake at 200 degrees for 1 hour or until dry. Turn oven off, and let  meringues cool in closed oven at least 12 hours. Carefully remove meringues  from paper.    Combine 2/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, and lemon rind in a saucepan; stir well.  Gradually add water and lemon juice; stir with a wire whisk until blended.  Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Gradually stir one-fourth of hot lemon mixture into egg yolk; add to  remaining lemon mixture, stirring constantly. Cook over medium heat 1  minute or until thickened, stirring constantly.    Pour lemon custard into a bowl; place plastic wrap on surface, and chill.  Yield: 10 servings.
