1. Cut the pork into 1-in. cubes and place them in a mixing bowl. Add 1 tsp  of the coriander seed, the peppercorns and sugar and stir well to blend.  Cover the bowl and let marinate for a least 20 min. If you can leave the  meat for longer, you will need to pat it dry with a paper towel befor  cooking. 2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the pork  cubes in one layer. When the oil is quite hot, aromatic and almost smoking,  add the meat. Cook, turning often to brown evenly, about 2-3 min. 3. Add  the wine to the skillet and bring to a boil, stirring. After 1-2  min.,reduce the heat to low and cook gently, turning the meat occasionally,  until the meat is tender and the wine reduced to about 4 tbsp. This should  take about 20 min. 4. Add the butter and the remaining coriander seeds.  Increase the heat to medium high and stir well to mix the melted butter  with the wine for a few sec. Add the coriander leaves, toss to coat the  meat and serve.    This dish: Porc a la grecque
