Tuna Braised with Cranberries, Port, and Cream
" thick, Tuna steaks, 6-8 oz each,, Whole cranberry sauce, Butter, Finely minced shallots, Demi-glaze or brown sauce, Port, Cream, 
Pan-fry the tuna for 1 minutes each side or until brown.  Remove the fish  and increase the heat to high. Deglaze the pan by pouring in the port. Add  the shallots, cranberry sauyce, demiglaze and orange zest and bring to a  boil.  Reduce the heat to simmer and add cream. Return the tuna steaks to  braise for 4 minutes. Remove the tuna to dinner plates and continue to  reduce the sauce for an additional 2-3 minutes. Swirl in the remaining  butter and pour the sauce over the tuna. Serves 2. Note: Demi-glaze is a  refinement on the brown sauce used by professional chefs. It is available  in the gourmet section of some supermarkets. A quality brown or espagnole  sauce, homemade or commercial, may be substituted. My note: According to  Larousse Gastronomique, demi-glaze, espagnole sauce, and brown sauce  require a lot of work. If youre not a gourmet cook, Id say it would be  reasonable to substitute a good-quality beef stock (not bouillon!) Chicken  stock, if you prefer, would probably work.  Just make sure its a low-salt.  It looks like the thing these sauces have in common is the strong taste of  the meat they were made from, and little of anything else.    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS  1-201-822-3627  Posted by FAYLEN    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
