Apple Cake 3 to 4 hours To Cook: In a medium-large bowl, sift together the  flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. With two  knives, cut the shortening into the flour until mixture is mealy. Make a  well in the center and drop in the egg and milk. Stir in the flour mixture  to form smooth batter, turn into greased 2-quart mold. Arrange the apples  in rows on top, pushing them halfway into the dough. In a small bowl, mix  the cinnamon, nutmeg and 2 tablespoons sugar. Sprinkle over the apples and  dot with apricot jam. Drizzle butter over all. Place in the slow cooker and  cover loosely with a plate. Cover the cooker, but prop the lid open a  fraction with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape.  Cook on High for 3 to 4 hours. Makes 6 servings.
