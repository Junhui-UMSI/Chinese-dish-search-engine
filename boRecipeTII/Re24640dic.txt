Place asparagus on a platter and let cool to room temperature.    Pass the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper around the table.  Pour some oil  (about 2 T) and some vinegar (about 1 t) onto each plate.  (Place a fork  underneath the top of your plate, tilting the plate gently toward you, and  pour the vinaigrette into the bottom of each plate.)  Sprinkle with salt  and pepper.    Serve the asparagus.  Pick up a piece of asparagus from the platter with  your hands and stir the vinaigrette with it a little before popping the tip  in your mouth.  Continue stirring and eating until you get to the tougher  bottom part of the stem.  Start over with a new piece, adding more oil and  vinegar as needed.  Pass finger bowls or damp towels after this entree!    As written by the author, Kate Ratliffe.
