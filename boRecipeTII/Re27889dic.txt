Thin Crust Pizza Dough
Flour, Sugar, Yeast, Water, Vegetable oil, 
Here's a pizza dough recipe I use which yields a thinner, less doughy  crust, usually. The ingredients are as follows:    First mix the dry ingredients together.   Next, heat up the water and oil in  the microwave for about 1 minute (warm to the touch).  Now, add it to the  dry ingredients. Knead it and put in a greased bowl and allow it to rise,  preferably on a warm surface (i.e. on top of the oven as it is being  pre-heated) and Voila.
