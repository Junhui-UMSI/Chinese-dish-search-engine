When steam starts  to come out, reduce heat and start timing. After 25 minutes take off stove  and cool down and remove lid.

Posted by Glen Jamieson to the Fidonet National Cooking echo with the  following comments:    Just for you, I have attached a recipe for Kangaroo Tail Soup, which was  derived from an Indonesian Ox Tail Soup, and can be used for Ox Tail. I  have made it many times, and it is a family favourite.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Aug 13, 98
