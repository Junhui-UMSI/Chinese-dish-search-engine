Asparagus with Toasted Almond Butter
almonds, Asparagus, Butter, 
Cut off the woody stems of asparagus. If stalks are thick, peel with a  vegetable peeler, pulling from stem end toward tip. (Thin spears do not  need peeling.) In a large skillet, bring about 1-inch of salted water to a  boil. Add asparagus and boil gently, uncovered, until tender, about 3 to 6  minutes after water comes to a boil. Timing depends on size and age of  spears. Drain. If not serving immediately, run under cold water with ice to  stop the cooking. Before serving, reheat in microwave for 2 to 3 minutes or  until hot. In a small skillet, melt butter over medium high heat. Add  almonds and saute, stirring, until butter is dark brown and almonds are  golden. Season with salt to taste. Before serving, spoon almonds and butter  over asparagus. vance Prep: Asparagus and almond butter may be refrigerated  separately overnight. Reheat both before serving. Prep Time: 10 minutes  Cook Time: 3 to 6 minutes Makes: 6 to 8 servings  http://www.safeway.com/recipe.asp MC formatting by bobbi744@sojourn.com  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Roberta Banghart <bobbi744@sojourn.com> on  Apr 03, 1998
