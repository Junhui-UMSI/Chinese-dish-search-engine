Pre-heat oven to 200 C, 400 F, Gas mark 6.    Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Flake the fish into a bowl.  Line a 35cm / 14inch by 20cm / 8inch swiss roll tin with silicone paper and  brush it lightly with oil. Put one bunch of watercress into a bowl. Cut two  of the oranges into segments and squeeze the juice of the third. Mix the  orange segments and the carrot into the watercress and set aside. Mix  together the orange juice, oil and sesame seeds. Season lightly.    Melt the margarine in a small pan and stir in the flour. Gradually add the  salmon stock, stirring to prevent lumps. Stir the prawns and mushrooms into  the sauce and cook gently for two minutes before adding the flaked salmon  and mixing well. Set aside.    Chop the remaining two bunches of watercress very finely. Beat the egg  yolks and chopped watercress together then season. Whisk the egg whites  until they form soft peaks then fold into the watercress mixture. Spread  into the lined tin and bake for l0 minutes.    When cooked, loosen the sides of the watercress roulade and quickly turn  out onto a flat surface. Peel away the silicone paper and spread the salmon  sauce evenly over the roulade. Quickly roll up, swiss roll fashion and trim  the edges.    Mix the orange juice dressing into the watercress salad and serve with  slices of the roulade.    Serves 6.
