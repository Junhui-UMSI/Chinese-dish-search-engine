Split each prawn lengthwise into 1 big piece  from the back down (dont cut all the way through). Then slice crosswise  into two pieces (one piece will have a tail and the other will not). Place  in bowl.  Mix with the egg white, salt, and cornstarch. Marinate for about  half an hour.  Coat each piece of Prawn with cornstarch lightly.     2) Remove the skin from the garlic and cut it lengthwise into slices.  After softening the fungus, remove the stems and tear inot small pieces.  Cook the green peas until done.     3) Prepare the seasoning sauce in a bowl.     4) Heat the oil in a pan.  Deep fry the prawns for about 30 seconds until  done. Remove the prawns and drain off the oil from the pan.     5) Reheat 3 tablespoons of oil in the saucepan.  Stir fry the garlic for a  few seconds.  Then add the fungus, carrot, and green peas. Stir a few  seconds again. Pour in the seasoning sauce and bring to boil.   Turn off heat and put the fried prawns into the sauce.   Sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of hot oil.  Mix well.
