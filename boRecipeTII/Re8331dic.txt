Shiitake or other fresh, Heavy cream, Grated Parmesan, Russet potatoes, (about 8, Salt, 
To prepare the potatoes, carefully cut potatoes into thin, even slices  using a knife or food processor with a slicing blade. Cut the slices into  1/8 inch wide strips. Cut the strips crosswise into very fine dice the size  of rice grains. As the potatoes are cut, place them in a large bowl of cold  water. (This can be prepared ahead to this point and set aside at room  temperature in the bowl covered with cold water.) To cook, bring 1 cup of  the cream to a boil in a heavy large nonstick saucepan over mediumhigh  heat. Drain the potatoes and add them to the cream. Simmer gently,  adjusting the heat, until the cream is absorbed, stirring occasionally.  Pour in 1/2 of the remaining cream with all of the mushrooms. Simmer gently  until the cream is absorbed, stirring occasionally. (This can prepared to  this point about 1 1/2 hours ahead and set aside at cool room temperature.)  To serve, bring to a simmer and pour in the remaining cream. Simmer until  thickened and the cream is absorbed (the potatoes will start to meld  together), for about 20 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan. Season with salt and  pepper. Mound in a vegetable dish or spoon out onto 4 to 6 large plates  with an entree. Serve immediately.
