Raspberry Cream Cheese Biscuits
Salt, All purpose flour, Baking Powder, unsalted butter, Cream cheese, Raspberry preserves, 
Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Celebrations: Holiday Brunch: Celebrations is a class that shows you how to  have a dining event that not only tastes good and looks good but is  generally enjoyable. Fitting with the holiday season, we worked on a  holiday brunch. Aside from these recipes, we learned about table  presentation, planning and tricks to make the event memorable. We also  created several types of food related decorations.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly flour a baking sheet.    Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Blend together cream cheese  and butter in a medium bowl. Stir in flour mixture until well blended. Do  not over work dough.    Roll out on a well floured surface to a 1/2 inch circle. Cut out with a 1  1/4 round cutter (or whatever cookie cutter you like). Dough will be  sticky. Place on a baking sheet and make a small indentation and fill with  a small amount of the raspberry preserves.    Try different types of preserves to add color and different flavors to your  next brunch.    These biscuits should be made the day of the brunch.
