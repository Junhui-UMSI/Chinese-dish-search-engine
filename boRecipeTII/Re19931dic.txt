Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour, the  sugar, undissolved yeast, salt and nutmeg. Stir bran mixture into dry  ingredients. Stir in apple and enough remaining flour to make soft dough.  Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8  minutes. Cover, let rest 10 minutes. Divide dough in half. On lightly  floured surface, roll each half to a 12- by 7-inch rectangle. Roll each up  tightly from short end as for a jellyroll. Pinch seams and ends to seal.  Place each loaf, seam side down, in greased 8-1/2 X 4-1/2 X 2-1/2-inch loaf  pan. Cover, let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about  30 to 45 minutes. Bake in a 375-degree oven for 40 minutes or until done.  Remove from pans; cool on wire rack. Drizzle with icing.    For the icing: Combine 1 cup confectioners sugar and 1 to 2 tbls apple  juice concentrate or lemon juice. Beat until smooth.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
