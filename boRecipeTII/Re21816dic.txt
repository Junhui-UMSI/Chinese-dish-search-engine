Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar  until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each  addition.    Combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; set aside. Combine  applesauce and molasses.    Add dry ingredients alternately with applesauce mixture to egg mixture.  Fold in raisins and nuts. Pour into a greased 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4 inch  loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted  into the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes, remove from pan and  continue cooling on a wire rack.    NOTES:    *  A simple, fragrant, apple-nut raisin bread -- I found this recipe on the  back of a label for a baking loaf pan. It is easy to make and because of  the molasses it is very fragrant while baking. Yield: 1 large loaf.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, 30 minutes cooling.  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.    : Lou Ann Puetz  : Tektronix Inc.
