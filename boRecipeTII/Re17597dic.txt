Throw in  almond extract (I pour in 1T, then I pour in a little extra). Stir. (Add  the sugar earlier with the gelatin; sorry) Gel in a square pan in the  refrigerator. When gelled, cut into squares. I serve it with fruit  cocktail.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
