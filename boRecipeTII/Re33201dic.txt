Recipe By : Taste Show # TS4754    Heat a griddle or skillet until hot. Sift together flour, salt and baking  powder. Whisk together egg, milk and butter. Add egg mixture to the flour  and stir just to moisten -- the batter will be lumpy, do not overmix. If  too dry, add a few more spoonfuls of milk. Lower heat to medium-high and  lightly brush griddle with butter. Spoon in the batter, by 1/4 cupfuls,  spreading to 4-inch rounds. Cook until edges are dry and little bubbles  appear on the surface, about 2 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook second side  just until lightly browned. Transfer pancakes as they are made to warm  plates and serve immediately, with butter and syrup.    Yield: 3 to 4 servings    Copyright, 1997, TV FOOD NETWORK, G.P., All Rights Reserved Posted to  MC-Recipe Digest V1 #614 by Peggy Morgan <75402.3465@compuserve.com> on 97
