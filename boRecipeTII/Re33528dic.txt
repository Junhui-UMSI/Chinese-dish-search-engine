Svingi (Batter Puffs with Honey and Cinnamon)
Butter or margarine, Honey; warmed, Boiling water, Baking Powder, Grated orange rind, All-purpose flour, Ground cinnamon, Salt, Granulated sugar, Eggs, Olive or other vegetable oil, 
In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the boiling water, butter, salt, sugar,  and orange rind.  Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, sift together the flour and  baking powder. Add the dry ingredients all at once to the hot mixture,  beating hard with a wooden spoon over medium heat until the mixture forms a  compact mass and leaves the sides of the pan. Remove from the heat and let  cool for 1 minute.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating hard after each  addition; the mixture should be smooth, glossy, and thick. Heat the oil  (which should be 2-1/2 to 3 inches deep) almost to the smoking point, then  drop the batter by tablespoons into the oil, without crowding, to form  puffs.  When the puffs surface, turn them to fry on all sides, using tongs,  then lift them out, drain off excess oil on absorbent paper. Place on warm  platter and keep warm. If using the syrup, boil the syrup ingedients for 5  minutes; spoon the syrup, or warm honey, over the puffs, sprinkle with  cinnamon, and serve hot.
