1. Remove phyllo from refrigerator 2 hours before using. Do not remove from  package, as it dries out quickly.    2. Brown sausage in large skillet 10 minutes, breaking up pieces with  wooden spoon. Stir in ground round and cook 5 minutes more until meat loses  its pink color. Add onions and garlic; cook until soft.    3. Tilt skillet and remove all fat (at least 1/2 cup). Return skillet to  heat; stir in parsley, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and tomato paste; cook        5    minutes.    4. Remove meat mixture to large bowl; cool; place in refrigerator until  ready to use.    5. Beat egg in medium-size bowl until foamy; stir in ricotta and Parmesan  cheeses; chill until ready to use.    6. Combine chilled cheese mixture and chilled meat. Form into a roll 9"  long and 2" high on foil; refrigerate while preparing phyllo.    7. Unfold phyllo on wax paper; remove 1 sheet to another piece of wax  paper; cover remaining sheets with damp towel; brush single sheet with  melted butter. Cover with second sheet of pastry; brush with butter.  Repeat, using 12 sheets of phyllo and brushing each with butter. Place meat  roll along short edge; roll up, jelly roll style, tucking in ends and  brushing with butter after each turn. Place a piece of foil over ends of  rolls; secure with toothpicks so filling will not come out. Place seam-side  down on a lightly oiled 15 X 10" jelly roll pan. Refrigerate until time to  bake. (Note: Can be prepared ahead up to this point.)    8. Bake in preheated 400F degree oven for 35 minutes or until golden.  Remove pan with meat to wire rack. Let stand about 30 minutes, then remove  to serving tray with wide spatula. Serve warm but not hot.    NOTES : Flaky, crisp layers of phyllo pastry are wrapped around a spicy  meat and cheese mixture.
