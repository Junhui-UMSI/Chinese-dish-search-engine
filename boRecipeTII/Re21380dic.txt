Trim the wings off the quail and discard them.  Carefully remove the legs  from the breast meat and marinate the legs and breast for 2 hours in half  the vinaigrette. About 20 minutes before salad time, grill the quail and  vegetables until the quail is firm and golden brown (about 7 to 9 minutes)  and the vegetables( with the exception of the avocado ) are soft and look  well grilled.  Allow them to rest for 10-15 minutes before assembling so  they are still warm but definitely not hot. Once cooled down, cut the  vegetables (except tomatoes) into small bite-sized pieces. To assemble the  salad, make four small beds of bibb lettuce on as many chilled plates and  top with the chopped grilled vegetables. Put the grilled quail legs at 3  and 9 oclock and lime wedges at 12 and 6 oclock with 3 cherry tomatoes  tossed on top.  Now carefully slice a quail breast into 6 thin strips  trying to maintain the shape of the breast, and place it on top of one of    the salads. Garnish with avocado slices. Repeat the procedure with the  remaining salads. Serve with the remaining vinaigrette.
