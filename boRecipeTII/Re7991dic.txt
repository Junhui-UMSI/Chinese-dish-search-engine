Onion, Bacon, Fresh cilantro, garlic, Onion, Salt, garlic, Water, Green bell pepper;, Banana, Dried Lentils, tomato paste, 
Wash the lentils thoroughly. Add to a pot with 6 cups water, salt, onion,  and garlic. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer, covered, for about 45  minutes or until the lentils are just tender. Remove the onion and garlic;  discard. Make a sofrito by sauteing the bacon pieces in a skillet until  they become brown but not crisp. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and  chopped garlic. Cook until the vegetables are soft. Add the tomato paste  and stir to combine. Add the sofrito to the lentils. Rinse out the skillet  in which the sofrito was cooked with 1/2 cup water and add to the lentils.  Cook for 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Add salt to taste, if desired. If  the soup seems too thick, add more water. Just before serving, stir in the  cilantro. Serve hot in individual bowls with sliced banana.
