(Female Magazine Cookbook)    Directions: In a mixing bowl, mix the ground almonds with the sugar, egg  whites, and lemon rind. Place the bowl in a saucepan filled with boiling  water. Stir the mixture continuously for about 15 mins to form a sticky  dough. Cool and chill.    Knead the dough, form a roll and cut about 2 dozen pieces. Shape into  cresents and brush with egg whites. Scatter the almond flakes over each  cresent and gently press the flakes in so that they stick to the cookies.  Place cresents on a greased baking tray and bake in a moderately heated  oven (*sorry* this is what the book says! - maybe 350 deg F?) for about 20  minutes.    Mix the sugar and water and simmer for a while. Brush the cookies with this  glaze 5 minutes before the end of baking time. Remove from the oven and  cool on a wire rack.
