Bbq Sauce From Jakes Wedding
Bottle catsup, Liquid smoke, Onion powder, Water, Mustard, Dashes of Tabasco, Garlic powder, Vinegar, 
This barbeque sauce was obtained from an elderly couple who made the  barbeque at my brothers wedding back around 1950. I never tried it, as I  am just learning to cook. But I do recall the BBQ was fantastic.
