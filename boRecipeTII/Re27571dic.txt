The Belgian Lions White Bean Soup
Leeks (white part only);, For the Soup, Carrots; chopped, Carrots, Sea salt, Chicken or beef stock*, Bay Leaves, Red onion; chopped, Onion, Fresh thyme, Garlic, Great northern beans, For the Beans, Chopped fresh spinach or red, Stalks celery, 
For the beans: Place all ingredients in a pot and cover with plenty of  water. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until beans are done. Leave beans  a bit underdone. Discard the vegetables and keep beans in cooking broth.    For the soup: *1 to 2 quarts of good chicken or beef broth. Chicken or beef  is a matter of taste and the amount you use will determine how thick the  soup will be. If you serve the soup as one course of a several course  dinner you probably want to keep the soup rather thin. On the other hand,  this soup can be served as a main course and then could be served quite  thick.    Place all the ingredients except spinach or chard in a heavy pan with some  good olive oil. Saute the vegetables without browning. Keep them firm.  Strain the beans and add them to the other vegetables. Add the amount of  stock you want and bring to a gentle simmer. Add salt and black pepper to  taste. If you are using spinach (my preference) or chard, coarsely chop the  leaves, discarding the stems and add to the soup.    If you are serving the soup as a main course you may serve it accompanied  by a good country bread and grated Parmesan or Swiss cheese.  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Crane C.
