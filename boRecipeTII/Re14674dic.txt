Transfer the cooked meat to a second large heavy skillet using a slotted  spoon.  Set aside.  Wash the peppers in cold water.  Discard the stems and  seeds.  Tear the peppers into 2" pieces.  Place the pieces in a small sauce  pan with the first measure of (cold) water.  Cover.  Simmer 20 minutes.  Drain, reserving the cooking water.  Peel the skin from the peppers. Place  in the work bowl of a food processor. Add the reserved water. Puree with  short pulses. Mix the pepper puree into the beef. Add the second measure of  water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a slow simmer. Cover.  Simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in all the remaining ingredients except the  masa harina. Cover. Simmer 45 minutes. Mix in the masa harina. Cover.  Reduce heat to the lowest possible. Cook 30 minutes longer, stirring  occasionally so that the mixture doesnt stick. If too thick, thin with  small amounts of boiling water. Serve.
