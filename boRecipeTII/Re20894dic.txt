You can tell its old  because it asks you to start in a cold oven and uses oleo (mom said that  was used during WWII). I request this for my birthday every year.    APPLE NUT CAKE: (Dont use mixer and begin in cold oven.) Mix oil, sugar  and eggs. Add apples and nuts. Sift flour, salt and soda; add sifted  mixture to above 1/3 at a time, then add 2 tsp. vanilla. Bake in 325! oven  (start cold) for 1 1/2 hours in greased tube pan. After cooling, poke holes  all over and cover with glaze (below).    BROWN SUGAR GLAZE: Cook butter and sugar over low heat until butter melts.  Add evaporated milk.  Bring to hard boil. Cool and stir; beat with a spoon.  Add vanilla. Pour slowly over cake - EAT!!
