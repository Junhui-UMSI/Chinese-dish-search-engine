These came out of the Jan/Feb 96 Chile Pepper Magazine written by Barb &  Ron Kroll. I cant say that Ive tried any of them. Hope they help.    Saute the garlic and chile in the oil for a couple of minutes.  Add the  crayfish and saute for an additional 3 or 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the wine, raise the heat and reduce the sauce by half.  Stir in the  butter to make a smooth sauce. Season with the salt and pepper and serve.
