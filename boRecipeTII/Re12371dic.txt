Cut remainder  into 1/4-inch slices. - In skillet, over moderate heat, brown sausage;  crumble well. Leaving drippings in skillet, remove sausage to drain. -  Reduce heat. Add onion and zucchini slices to pan. Cover and cook over  medium-low heat until slightly tender, about 5 minutes, stirring twice and  gently. - In a well-sprayed 8x1-1/2 inch round cake pan, starting in center  of dish, arrange cooked zucchini slices in concentric circles using all of  the slices. - Set over temperature to 350 degrees F.    ~ Make the corn muffin mix according to package instructions for Johnnie  Cake. Add cheese, crumbled sausage, and shredded zucchini, and optional  orange zest, to cornbread batter.  Spread mixture evenly over the zucchini  slices. - Bake for 25 minutes (more or less) or till top is golden. - Using  a spatula, loosen sides of corn bread from dish; invert onto a serving  platter.  Let it stand a little, as needed, thumb-thump to loosen. Makes 6  wedges.  Serve warm.  Great with honey-butter (mix equal parts together).
