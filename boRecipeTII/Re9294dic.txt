Puerto Rican Egg Nog (Coquito)(Best Version)
Water, cinnamon, egg yolks, evaporated milk, Coconut milk, sweetened Condensed milk, White rum, 
In a 2 quart saucepan, heat water and cinnamon sticks to boiling over high  heat.  Reduce heat to medium and cook until liquid is reduced to one cup.  Remove cinnamon sticks and set liquid aside to cool to room temperature.    In a 3 quart saucepan with a wire whisk, beat egg yolks and evaporated milk  until well-mixed.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until mixture  thickens and coats a spoon - about 10 munutes (DO NOT BOIL). Set aside to  cool slightly.    When cinnamon flavored liquid has cooled, stir in coconut milk, until well  mixed.  In serving bowl, combine coconut mixture, yolk mixture, sweetened  condensed milk and rum.  Chill well and serve.    Many thanks to Stephanie Kuzemchak and Dianne Weinsaft.
