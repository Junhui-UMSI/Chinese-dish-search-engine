Tyropittakia (Cheese Pies)
Chopped, Butter, Oil for greasing, Eggs (lightly beaten), Gruyere cheese or cottage, To 10 sheets of fillo pastry, Feta cheese, Fresh mint or dill, finely, Cheese (see note), 
Preheat the oven to 350 F/ 180 C/ gas mark 4.    To make the filling, drain the feta of its salty water and crumble into a  bowl with a fork or fingers. Add the Gruyere/cottage cheese, eggs and  dill/mint to the Feta and mix well.    Cut the whole stack of fillo pastry into 3/4 long strips about 3 inches  wide. Brush each sheet with melted butter, place a (quite heaped) teaspoon  of filling at one end (in the corner). Fold over diagonally to cover and  keep folding into triangular pies - making sure that all sides have as many  layers as possible to avoid spillage. Place the pies on an oiled baking  sheet, brush the tops with butter and bake for 20 minutes or until crisp  and light golden.    Good when warm - can keep for a few days in an airtight container.    You could also use more spinach instead of the herbs and decrease the  amount of cheese used proportionally.    (note: Here in the UK Feta is saltier than in Greece so this is why these  ingredients are added)    Time: 50 minutes Source: Sainsburys "the cooking of Greece and Turkey" by  Rena Salaman
