Warp Drive Chocolate Pie
Butter, Heavy cream, Pkg semi-sweet morsels, Egg yolks, Finely crushed choco wafers, Kahlua or Cognac, 
In a small bowl, combine the wafers and butter and press into a 10"  pyrex or pottery pie plate. Place in freezer for one hour.    In blender, combine chocolate bits, egg yolks and liquor and set aside  without blending. In a small saucepan, heat cream until it just  boils. With blender going on low speed, pour hot cream into chocolate  mixture. When all the cream has been added, blend on high speed. The  heat of the cream will melt the chocolate and cook the egg yolks. Pur  the mixture into the frozen pie shell and chill for 3 hours. Dont  freeze.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
