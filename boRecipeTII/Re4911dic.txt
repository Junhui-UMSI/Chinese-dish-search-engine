Kosher salt, Fennel (about 9 bulbs), Sugar, Whole pieces star anise, Orange, White vinegar, 
1. Wash 3 pint jars and lids with hot soapy water and rinse well. (You can  use canning jars and lids, but you dont have to.)    2. Wash fennel and cut away any bruises or bad spots; trim ends and slice  into very thin rings. Cut three 1-inch-long strips of peel from the orange.  Remove any pith from peel.    3. Bring 1 1/2 C water, the vinegar, salt, and sugar to a boil in a large  pot.    4. Meanwhile, fill each jar halfway with fennel. Place 1 piece of orange  rind and 2 pieces star anise on top of fennel. Fill jar with remaining  fennel, using the back of a clean spoon to pack it down. Leave 1/4 inch of  space beneath the rim.    5. Pour hot liquid over fennel, covering it by 1/4 inch and leaving 1/2  inch of space beneath the rim of each jar. Place lids on jars and let stand  until cool. Store in refrigerator; serve within 3 to 5 days.
