TO MAKE PANCOTTI:    Rinse and dry zucchini and trim both ends. Slice into 1/16th-inch rounds  and set aside. In a 10- to 12-inch sautJ pan, heat olive oil until smoking.  Add onion and garlic and cook over medium heat until lightly browned and  softened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add zucchini and oregano leaves and cook  until very soft, about 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.    In a mixing bowl, stir together coated zucchini mixture, egg, ricotta,  Pecorino, nutmeg and parsley until well mixed and season lightly with salt  and pepper. Roll out pasta into sheets on second thinnest setting and cut  into 3-inch rounds with water glass or pasta cutter. Place 1/2 tablespoon  zucchini mixture into each and fold into a half moon. Continue until all  the pasta is used. Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.  Drop pancotti into water and cook until pasta is tender, about 3 to 4  minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter in a 12- to 14-inch sautJ pan and add sage  leaves. Drain pasta in a colander and pour into butter mixture. Toss to  coat well and pour into heated pasta dish. Shave cacio over pasta using a  vegetable peeler and serve.
