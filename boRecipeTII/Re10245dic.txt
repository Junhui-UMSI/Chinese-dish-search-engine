Quick and Easy Spicy Soy Sauce
Hot oil, Powdered ginger, Soy sauce, Garlic powder, Sesame oil, 
I tend to cook without recipes and with a real eye to quickness. In other  words, Im lazy. Thought Id share a couple ideas Ive come up with  recently (obviously I never measure anything--sorry).    To a partly-full bottle of soy sauce, I add some garlic powder and some  powdered ginger and a little sesame oil and hot oil. I keep this around  (havent needed to refrigerate it), shake it up and sprinkle a bit over  steamed vegetables (my favorite is green cabbage, sliced finely). A little  goes a long way so I think the fat from the oils is negligible. The flavor  they add is significant.    Posted by Posted by Posted by laura@acpub.duke.edu (Laura H.
