Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. If necessary, cut a thin slice from the  bottom of a halved squash in order to make it stand level when stuffed. Oil  a large non-stick roasting pan. Place the squash skin side up in the pan.  Bake until the thickest part of the flesh is tender when pierced with a  fork (about 45 minutes). Heat 3/4 of the butter in a large skillet over  medium heat. Add the onion, celery and a pinch of salt and pepper. Saute,  stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft but not brown (about 5  minutes). Add the ginger and apples. Saute, stirring often, for about 10  minutes. Stir in the allspice. Transfer to a bowl. Cool slightly. Add the  breadcrumbs and pecan. Add the egg. Toss lightly. Reduce oven temperature  to 350 degrees. Fill the squash halves with generous amounts of stuffing.  Melt the remaining butter and drizzle over the squash. Cover. Bake until  the stuffing is heated through (about 30 minutes). Serve.
