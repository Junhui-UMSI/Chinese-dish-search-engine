Heat oven to 350F.  Grease & flour 2 9"x5" loaf pans Cream butter & sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  In a separate  bowl, mix together all dry ingredients, except raisins and poppyseeds. In a  measuring cup mix milk, water & flavoring.  There should be just over 1 cup  liquid.  Add dry mixture and liquids alternately to creamed mixture,  beating well after each addition. Add poppyseeds & blend thoroughtly, then  add the raisins and stir them in gently by hand (to prevent the  flour-coating from coming off which will send all the raisins to the bottom  of the cake!) Pour batter into prepared pans and bake appx. 1 hour 10  minutes (till the edges pull away from the sides of the pan, and a skewer  stuck in the center comes out clean). This is a very densely textured cake,  not like the standard white-cake type of poppyseed cake.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
