Pare a 1-inch strip  of skin from around the top. Rub cut surfaces with lemon, dripping a few  drops into the core. Combine dates, raisins and cinnamon basil and fill  center of apple with mixture.    Arrange apples in a baking dish just large enough to hold them. with a  vegetable peeler, carefully remove the orange part of the orange peel. Cut  peel into very fine strips.  Squeeze orange juice; pour around apples,  using enough to make about 1/2-inch of juice in the dish. Drop cut strips  of orange peel into juices.    Bake, basting with juices every 10 or 15 minutes, for 50 minutes or until  apples are tender when pierced with a knife.    Sprinkle with a little sugar and broil with surface of fruit four inches  below of heat Baste with remaining syrup until glazed.    Best made ahead of time; serve at room temperature.  A dollop of our cream  or fresh yogurt is a nice garnish.    EAT-L Digest 28 June 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
