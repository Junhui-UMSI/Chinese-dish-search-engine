Game Terrines - Elk and Pork - S.c. I. Dinner Pt 2
See part 1, 
Terrine #3, Put this terrine together as the others, in layers, using the  listed ingredients and seasonings making any pattern you wish. Remember  these are just suggestions for ingredients to use in these terrines and you  are only limited by you imagination and flavors that will blend together.    To cook The terrine- Place the terrine pan in a boiling water bath that  comes about halfway up the sides of the pan and cook in a preheated 350  degree oven for about 1 1/2 hours or until the meat reaches an internal  temperature of 160 degrees. Remove and chill overnight before serving.  Classically it should be cooled with a weight on top of it to compress it  as it cools. I find that when I do this the terrine tends to be too dry. I  cool mine unweighted.    NOTES : Salt and the Cajun seasoning are to taste in all of the terrines.
