Sesame oil, Boned and skined turkey, Dry sherry, Sesame seeds, Soy sauce, Minced Ginger, White pepper, Brown sugar, Chopped scallions or green, Salt, Clove minced garlic, TERIYAKI MARINADE, Whole minced Shallots, 
Teriyaki Marinade: Toast sesame seeds until golden. Mix all ingredients  together and enjoy!!    Rinse meat & pat dry. Pull off and discard and fat & connective tissue. To  make it easier to slice, freeze it until it feels firm, not hard. Cut  turkey into 1/8 to 1/4 inch slices.    Marinade in teriyaki 1-24 hours. Set oven at 150 to 200 degrees. Coat metal  rack with non-stick cooking spray. <This is the messy part> Put turkey  strips close but not overlapping on the racks. You will want to put cookie  sheets on rack below to catch the drippings. (another way is to put cooling  racks on a cookie sheet and put in oven - easier clean-up). Prop door open  about 2 inches. Dry until a cool piece of jerky cracks and breaks when  bent, 3 to 5 hours.    Let jerky cool. Store in airtight containers in cool, dry place up to 3  weeks, in refrigerator up to 4 months or longer in freezer. Makes about 7  ounces.
