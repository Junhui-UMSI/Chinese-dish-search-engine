Preheat oven to 350F. Soak bulgur wheat in water 20 min and drain well. Put  onion and lam through fine blade of meat grinder several times until  reduced to paste; grind bulgur wheat untill smooth and pasty and knead into  lamb mixture along with salt. Pat half of mixture overthe bottom of an  oiled 13x9x2 panand set aside. For middle layer, stir fry onion and garlic  in oil 8-10 min in a large, heavy skillet over moderate heat; add lamb,  salt spices, and pepper and heat, stirring, about 10 min, breakin up any  clumps of meat. Off heat, mix in nuts and currants; spread over wheat layer  in pan. Pat remaining wheat mixture over all and press down firmly. Score  top in a crisscross pattern and drizzle butter over the surface. Bake,  uncovered, 30-40 min untill lightly browned. Cool slightly, cut into large  squares and serve topped with dollops of yougurt..    NOTES : I use ground chuck if lam is not available. I do not have a  grinder, so I buy the finest bulgur available and mince just the lm in a  food processor. Mcformatted by Jazzbel@batelnet.bs.  Recipe by: The New Doubleday Cookbbok 1985 Ed.
