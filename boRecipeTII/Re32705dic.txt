Sweet Potato Biscuits #1
Salt, sweet potatoes, milk, Baking Powder, Butter, bread flour, 
From: dmorton@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (Daniel Morton)    Date: Sun, 31 Oct 1993 05:33:03 GMT  I recently developed a knack for making biscuits, and found these two  recipes to be my favorites so far. The curried biscuits were particularly  delicious covered with a thick spicy lentil stew. Melted the snow outside  our door, honest! Combine flour, baking powder and salt and sift into  mixing bowl.  Cut in butter, rubbing it in with tips of fingers. Add sweet  potatoes, then the milk (2-4 T ??) Mix Knead for 30 seconds on floured  board.  Pat lightly into a sheet 1/2" thick, and cut with cutter (a glass  works) Place biscuits on a very lightly oiled baking sheet and bake in a  450 F oven for 12-17 min. Makes about    12.  Serve very hot!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
