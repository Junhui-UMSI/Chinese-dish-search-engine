Light soy sauce., Sesame oil., Lean pork., (440ml) shredded chinese, Fresh ground black pepper;, Cooking oil.; (up to 3), Books of "vermicelli"*, 
* (they are translucent when raw, very fine, and _white_ when cooked)    1. Shred pork into 5x5mm matchsticks.    2. Heat oil in wok, and stir-fry pork until no pink shows.    3. Add soy sauce and black pepper.    4. Cook for another 5 mins, then keep warm.    5. Bring a pot of water to boil, then add noodles.    6. Put on kettle, about 3-4 cups.    7. When noodles are tender, drain and place in bowl.    8. Place pork and sesame oil on bed of noodles.    9. Pour boiling water from kettle over the pork to make a soup.    10. Serve, then eat with chopsticks and chinese soup spoon.    All the recipe books would say this "serves four", but were always so  hungry that the two of us can eat all this and still want more, ie _serves  two hungry people_. This recipe is great for taking to work or school. Stop  before step 9, and when lunch comes you can add hot water from the office  urn, etc. Then you have a nice hot lunch - yum yum!!
