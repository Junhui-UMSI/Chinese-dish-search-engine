Garnish:, Vegetarian Chili Mix (TVP), Black or pinto beans, INGREDIENTS, Diced tomatoes, black olives, Flour Tortillas, 10", Guacamole, diced onions,, Water, or white grape juice, Medium onion, diced, Picante Sauce, 
Method: Heat water or juice to boiling and pour over TVP in a heatproof  bowl. Allow to sit for 10 minutes until water is absorbed. Add beans with  juice to TVP. Saute onions in a little water or juice until soft. Lay out  your tortillas flat, and divide bean-TVP mixture evenly among the 8  tortillas. Then fold the tortilla up from the bottom, down from the top,  and then fold the two ends to the middle. "Pin" them with a toothpick.  Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray, place the "envelopes" on the  cookie sheet, and spray them with the cooking spray. Place in a 350 degree  oven for 10-15 minutes until crisp and slightly browned. Take the  toothpicks out when baked - they will stay in shape. Use what you need, and  freeze the rest in plastic freezer bags. When ready to serve, heat in oven  or microwave and top with tomatoes and onions - guacamole and black olives,  picante sauce as desired.         Original - Alice in Houston - 9/12/92
