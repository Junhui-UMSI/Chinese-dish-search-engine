*pre-baked in a 9 1/2 inch tart pan with removable bottom.    Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. When hot, add onions  and cook, stirring often, until slightly brown, about 4 minutes. Remove  from heat. Add flour, salt, pepper and nutmeg and stir until well mixed.  Stir in milk and cook over medium heat until creamy and thickened, about 20  seconds. Pour Egg Beaters in a 2-quart bowl. (If using whole eggs, whisk  until fluffy.) Add onion mixture in small amounts, stirring well after each  addition. Ladle mixture into pre-baked pastry in tart pan. Sprinkle cheese  evenly over the top. Garnish with chives.    Place tart pan on a baking sheet for easy handling. Bake at 350F until  puffy and browned around the edges, 35 to 40 minutes. (Bake a few minutes  less if using whole eggs.)
