Vegetable and Tortellini Salad
Green onion, Red pepper, celery, Italian salad dressing, Black olives, Cheese tortellini, cauliflower, broccoli, marinated artichoke, 
Prepare the night before. Prepare tortellin according to manufacturers  directions; drain and cool under cold water. Add to prepared raw vegetables  and toss with one half (8 ounces) of the salad dressing. Cover and  refrigerate. Just before serving, toss with the remaining salad dressing.    My Notes: Very Good! Did not use olives or artichokes. Added 2 chopped  tomatoes.    Recipe by: Lisa Eat-L    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by RollFamily <RollFamily@AOL.COM> on Mar 10, 1998
