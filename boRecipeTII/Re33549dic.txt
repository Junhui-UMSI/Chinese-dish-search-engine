From:    Tina Rogers <CAJUNT@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU>    Date:    Sat, 27 Jul 1996 08:10:45 EDT  Before melting marg. or butter, grease a 9" pie plate and fill 2/3 full of  sliced apples.  Combine 1 tbsp of sugar with 1 tsp of cinnamon and sprinkle  over apples.  Mix sugar, flour, egg, nuts, and marg. or butter.  Pour over  apples and bake at 350 for about 40 minutes or until golden brown.    (Note:  Ive always used pecans because I have an abundance of them. Yes, I  feel blessed; I dont have to use store-bought.)    EAT-L Digest 26 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
