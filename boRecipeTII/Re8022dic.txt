In a bowl soak Porcini in warm water 30 minutes, or until softened. Slowly  strain soaking liquid through a fine sieve lined with a coffee filter or a  double thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth into a small saucepan,  being careful to leave the last tablespoon (containing sediment) in bowl.  Boil soaking liquid until reduced to about 1/2 cup.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    Wash Porcini under cold water to remove any grit and pat dry. Coarsely chop  Porcini. Peel potatoes and slice 1/8 inch thick. In a large (4-quart)  saucepan cook Porcini and garlic in butter over moderate heat, stirring, 2  minutes. Add potatoes, reduced Porcini liquid, milk, cream, 4 teaspoons  chives, and salt and bring liquid to boil, stirring.    Transfer mixture to a buttered 2-quart gratin dish and bake 1 hour, or  until potatoes are tender. Sprinkle gratin with remaining 2 teaspoons  chives.
