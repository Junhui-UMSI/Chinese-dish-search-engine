Sweet Potato Poi
Sweet potatoes, Coconut milk, salt and pepper, 
Boil sweet potatoes in their jackets until tender. Peel & mash,  beating until smooth. Season with salt & pepper. Gradually beat in  enough coconut milk to make the desired consistency- one finger, two  finger, or three finger poi. (The consistency of poi varies with the  amount of liquid used & it is called one finger, two finger or three  finger poi, depending upon how many fingers are needed to get it from  the serving dish to the mouth without dribbling it on the chin.) Keep  hot in top part of a double boiler. Serve in individual bowls.    **To make coconut milk, heat one 3 1/2 oz can flaked coconut, or 1 cup  fresh or frozen grated coconut & 1 cup milk until it reaches the  boiling point. Allow to cool at room temperature. Strain through 2  thicknesses of cheesecloth, squeezing out as much liquid as possible.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
