Fresh basil pesto led the revolution in authentic Italian cooking in  America. It wasnt red and it didnt cook for hours on the stove. In fact,  it was green! And you didnt have to cook it at all! The fragrant green  leaves, crushed with garlic and pine nuts, when tossed with freshly cooked  pasta, creates a dish of unforgettale aroma and taste. Aromatic pesto can  be used as a spread for panini with equally memorable effect. The following  recipe produces a dense mixture specifically for panini; to use with pasta,  just add a little more olive oil and thin with some hot pasta cooking  water.
