Tofu and Pumpkin-Seed Burgers (Hl)
Grated fresh ginger, Cumin seeds, Firm tofu, Garlic, Hulled unsalted pumpkin, Canola oil; (up to 2), Salt, Black Pepper, Cooked or canned adzuki, Miso paste; brown rice paste, Onion, Stale or toasted sandwich, 
Chop the bread fine, or break into pieces and whirl it to crumbs in a food  processor. In a food processor or with a potato masher in a bowl, coarsely  chop or mash the beans. Coarsely chop the toasted pumpkin seeds. Combine  the beans, bread crumbs and pumpkin seeds in a large bowl.    Cut the tofu into four pieces and squeeze each piece with your hands,  letting the crumbled tofu fall into the bowl with the mashed beans. Toast  the cumin seeds in a small skillet over low heat, stirring, until they  become fragrant. Add the ginger, garlic, cumin, miso and onion to the bowl  with the beans and tofu. Mix everything(this will be easiest to do with  your hands). Mix in the salt and pepper. The mixture should be stiff enough  to form a patty. If the mixture still seems a bit wet, add more bread  crumbs. Form the mixture into patties.    Heat a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high heat. Add 1  tablespoon oil, and place as many burgers in the pan as you can without  crowding them. Pan-fry the burgers, in batches if necessary, until the  undersides are a deep golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Flip the burgers,  and cook them about 3-4 minutes more. Serve right away with Hot and Sour  Slaw.
