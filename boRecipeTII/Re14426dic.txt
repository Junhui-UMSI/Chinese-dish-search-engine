Whole Wheat Irish Soda Bread
Bread flour, Raisins, Baking soda, Buttermilk, Caraway seeds, Salt, Butter, Whole wheat flour, Yeast, 
The only difference besides the whole wheat flour, is that this recipe has  no sugar at all...wonder why!? My Panasonic machine has a setting for  making  Whole Wheat Bread and this recipe is for making the Whole Wheat  Irish Soda Bread that I tried yesterday.  It was a big hit!!
