I thought Id share with you this variant on the traditional Guacamole I  knocked up last night:    I didnt expect to taste the basil but it really shone through very  strongly.  I put this down to its strong affinity to tomato.    Also I was concerned the pepper would spoil the other flavour but its aroma  blended in to produced a slightly sweeter aftertaste.
