Heat crabmeat in milk and butter.  Make cream sauce by cooking butter and  flour together slowly for 2 minutes, then whisking in milk, and salt and  pepper to taste. Bring to boil and whisk until smooth. Add cream; stir in  crabmeat as soon as it simmers.  When it is just at boiling point, stir in  whiskey.  Serve in heated cups with a sprinkling of parsley.    No good cook is above profiting by anothers mistakes. When his friend Mrs.  Jennings added a splash of Scotch instead of using sherry in the crab soup  she made for him, Beard didnt object to the flavor but did add her recipe  to his lifetime collection.
