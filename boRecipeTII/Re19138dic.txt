Review: "An enticing entree for a summer lunch or supper, these kabobs are  based with fresh rosemary butter. You can bake at 450F as directed, or  prepare the packets on the grill, in the foil; cover and cook for about 35  minutes."    Place a 12" X 18" double thickness of aluminum foil on the work surface.  Lightly e coat with no-stick spray.    SKEWERS:  Use metal or use bamboo (soak first). Thread the vegetables on 4  long metal skewers, alternating the yellow squash, zucchini, eggplant,  potatoes, red peppers and green peppers with garlic and shallots. Lay the  skewers on the foil.    In a small bowl, combine the butter or margarine, rosemary, salt and black  pepper. Brush half the mixture lightly over the vegetables. Turn the kabobs  and brush the other side.    Fold the long sides of the foil together making several folds to encase the  food snugly. Fold the ends closed to enclose securely (the end of the  skewers might protrude).    Place the packet on a baking sheet. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the  potatoes are soft. Be careful of escaping steam when opening the packet.  Serve with the rice.    15 minutes attention; 50 minutes total.
