Pumpkin and Maple Sugar Pie
Whipped cream -- optional, Eggs, 9 inch pie crust -- unbaked, All-purpose flour, Maple syrup, Sugar, Pumpkin, canned, Ground nutmeg, Margarine, Ground cinnamon, milk, Ground ginger, 
In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except the last two. Pour into  the pie shell. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and  continue baking for about 45 minutes more, or until knife inserted near the  center comes out clean. Cool to room temperature, refrigerate. Garnish with  whipped cream if desired. Try to use REAL maple syrup for this pie; it does  not taste the same with the imitation type.
