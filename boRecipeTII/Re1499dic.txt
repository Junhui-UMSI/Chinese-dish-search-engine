* Arrowroot or cornstarch may be used instead of kuzu    Split filets and lay flat on a dry work surface. The key to this recipe is  very fine julienne vegetable pieces, so that the fish isnt overpowered by  the stuffing. Lay the split filet on the work surface, with a short end  closest to you. Place a small amount of each of the vegetables, crosswise  across the end closest to you. Gently roll the fish around the filling and  secure it with a toothpick at the end.    Repeat with balance of filet pieces. Arrange roll-ups in a small skillet,  cut side up. Arrange any leftover vegetables around the roll-ups. Add  enough spring water to cover 1/4 of the filet pieces. Cover and bring to a  boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer 5-7 minutes, until fish is  just opaque. While fish cooks, prepare the shiitake sauce. Heat oil in a  skillet and saute shiitake with mirin and a splash of soy sauce for 3-4  minutes. Add water, bring to a boil and cover. Reduce heat and simmer 5-7  minutes until shiitake are soft. Season lightly with soy sauce and simmer  2-3 minutes more. Pool shiitake sauce in individual serving plates and  arrange two roll-ups in the center, surrounded by some of the extra  julienned veggies. Serve garnished with fresh lemon slices.    NOTES : This is a really pretty dish to serve. The delicate, almost  translucent flesh of the fish is gently rolled around bright-colored  julienned vegetables and served on a pool of rich, shiitake sauce. Any  thin, white fish may be substituted.    Recipe by: Cooking the Whole Foods Way,  Christina Pirello    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Ellen C." <ellen@elekta.com> on Sep 10, 1998,
