Salt, Sugar, Tightly packed fresh, Fresh Thai basil leaves,, Garlic cloves, smashed, Fresh galangal (or fresh, Shallots, sliced, Thai fish sauce (nam pla), Water, Black pepper, Stalks fresh lemon grass, Fresh Thai "bird" chiles *, Fresh kaffir lime leaves, Chicken (4 to 5 pounds), Fresh lime juice, 
* (or 4 Serranos), cut into coarse strips, seeds and all.    Salt the chicken inside and out and let stand for 30 minutes to an  hour.    In a pot the chicken will fit in snugly, bring water to a boil.  Add  the chicken and when the water returns to a boil, skim the foam. Cut  off the bottom 1/3 of the lemon grass stalk, discarding the rest. Cut  the bottom on the bias into oval slices and add to the pot along with  the galangal, garlic, chiles, shallots and kaffir lime leaves (if you  can find them).    Turn the heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and simmer for  30 minutes.  Then add the fish sauce, sugar and up to 2 teaspoons of  salt (or to taste).  Simmer until the skin near the wing starts to  split, about 30 more minutes, then remove the chicken to a large,  round serving bowl leaving the stock in the pot.  Cover the chicken  to keep warm.    Add the lime juice to the broth as well as the coriander and basil  leaves. Pour the broth over the chicken, sprinkle with the black  pepper and serve.    The chicken should pull off the bone easily; its best eaten from  bowls with some of the broth and herbs poured over.    Bruce Cost, San Francisco Chronicle, 9/14/88.
