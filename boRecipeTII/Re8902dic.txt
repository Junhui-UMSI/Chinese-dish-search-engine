Prejeans Barbeque Shrimp
Chicken Stock, Butter, Bay leaf, Thyme, Blonde roux, Beer, Fresh garlic, Shrimp, Worcestershire Sauce, Basil, Black pepper, Sugar, Tabasco sauce, 
In a small bowl combine the seasoning mix ingredients.  Combine 1 stick of  the butter, the garlic, worcestershire and seasoning mix in a large skillet  over high heat.  When the butter is melted add the shrimp (deheaded with  shell still on)  Cook for 2 minutes, shaking the pan. Dont stir. Add  chicken stock; cook and shake pan for 2 minutes.  Add the beer and cook and  shake the pan 1 minute longer. Remove from heat. Serve in bowls with a lot  of French bread to dip in sauce. Very important to shake pan back and forth  and NOT to stir, to blend the sauce well and to prevent oily texture.  Source:  James Graham; Chef Prejeans Restaurant; Lafayette, La.
