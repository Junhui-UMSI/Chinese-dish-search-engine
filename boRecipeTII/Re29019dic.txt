Drain pineapple, saving juice. Combine sugar & flour. Butter baking dish.  Line with layer of pineapple. Sprinkle half the flour-sugar mixture over  pineapple, then half the cheese. Add remaining pineapple & top with rest of  sugar, flour & cheese. Pour pineapple juice over top, inserting fork in 2-3  places to allow juice to seep to bottom. Bake covered at 300 for 45 minutes  or until mixture appears clear. Remove cover & let brown in oven about 15  minutes. Keep warm while serving. (Great with ham or duck.)
