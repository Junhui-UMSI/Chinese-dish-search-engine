Hi Scott, hi Stacy! Know you love desserts, so I thought Id share this  fabulous recipe from Bon Appetit with you. Granted, it is a bit  time-consuming, but should keep you busy - and...it is so worth the wait.  Whisk yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, and Marsala in large metal bowl to blend.  Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not allow water to touch  bottom of bowl). Using portable electric mixer beat until mixture triples  in volume about 5 minutes. Cover zabaglione and refrigerate until well  chilled. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead). Place mascarpone in large bowl.  Using electric mixer whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to  soft peaks. Fold into mascarpone. Gently fold in zabaglione. Refrigerate  until well chilled about 3 hours. Combine espresso coffee, rum, 3  tablespoons sugar, and vanilla in small bowl. Brush over both sides of cake  pieces. Place generous tablespoon mascarpone mixture in bottom of each of 8  balloon-shaped wineglasses. Set cake square or wedge into each at angle.  Top with remaining mascarpone mixture. Combine shaved chocolate and ground  coffee 03/13/92 2:41 PM beans. Sprinkle over desserts. Refrigerate until  chilled at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours. NOTE: Instead of 12x6x1  layer sponge cake cut into eight 3 squares you may use a 9 round sponge  cake cut into 8 wedges. Take all the time you need to enjoy this  scrumptious recipe!
