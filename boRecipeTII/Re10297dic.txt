1. Prepare the sauce by heating the oil in a medium saucepan and sauteeing  the garlic and onions for a minute. Add chopped beans, and cook the  mixture, stirring it, for several minutes longer. Add the tomato puree (or  sue and puree), oregano, basil, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a boil and  simmer for 5 minutes.    2. To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the bean sauce on the  bottom of a 8x13-inch baking pan or shallow casserole. Arrange a layer of  noodles along the bottom of the pan to cover the sauce in such a way that  they touch but do not overlap. You should use about 1/3 of the noodles.  Cover the noodle layer with 1/2 of the ricotta, 1/2 of the mozarella, and  1/3 of the remaining sauce. Repeat with a layer of noodles, ricotta,  mozzarella and sauce. Finish off with layers of noodles, ricotta,  mozzarella and sauce. Finsish off with lay4ers of the remaining noodles and  sauce. Then sprinkle with the Parmesan on top.    3. Cover the pan tightly with foil. Bake the lasagna in a preheated  350-degree oven for about 1 hour or until the pasta is cooked. If thereis  too much liquid remaining in the pan, remove the foil and bake the lasagna  another 10-15 minutes.
