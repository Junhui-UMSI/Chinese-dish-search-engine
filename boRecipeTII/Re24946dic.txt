Autumn Chutney
Ground mixed spice, Ground ginger, Garlic cloves, chopped, Mace, Light brown sugar, Tomatoes, chopped, Plums, halved and stoned, Apples, peeled and cored, Sultanas, (raisins), Onions, sliced, 
Mix the fruit and vegetables together. Put into an preserving pan  (Note: these books call for an aluminum pan - I just dont use  aluminum with acid food ) Add the remaining ingredients, except the  sugar. Simmer for about 30 minutes until tender. Add the sugar and  stir until dissolved. Simmer gently, stirring frequently, until  thick. (Note: how long this takes depends on the water content of the  fruits). Cool, then pack the chutney into clean jars. Cover and seal.    PS: I always refrigerate after opening the jar. "Gathering the  produce of the season as the days shorten, as the sun travels lower  in the sky and the earth quietens, is a deeply satisfying pastime.  Making the most of the produce is a pleasure, too, and this chutney  brings several of the fruits of the season together in a  mouthwatering way.
