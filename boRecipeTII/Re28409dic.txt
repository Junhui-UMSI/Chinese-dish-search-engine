Baked Macaroni and Cheese 2
Bag of elbow macaroni,, Eggs, well beaten, *each* of medium cheddar,, 
In 9x13" pan, spray with Pam. Spread half of cooked macaroni in pan.  Sprinkle half of each cheese on top, using monterey jack in middle. Dot  with butter, and pour half of egg on top. Pour evaporated milk on top  (maybe about 1/4 - scant 1/2 of can). Repeat.    Bake at 350-375F until cooked throughout, and top is brownish.    Very rich, but delish. Freezes well.

It also made  enough for about 16 folks at my house. I cut the amount of macaroni in half  and doubled the cheddar cheese to 8 oz.  I also cut the milk in half. The  original was just a bit runny fresh from the oven. I think the changes made  a major improvement.  The extra cheddar gave the zing that was missing.  Reducing the amount of macaroni cut down on the weeks worth of left overs  we had the first time. Try the new improved version. Im sure youll enjoy  it.
