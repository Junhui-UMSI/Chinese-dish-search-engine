Strawberry Cheesecake Pie
Unbleached flour, Vegetable oil, Water, Lemon juice, Filling, Granulated sugar, Fresh strawberries, Cornstarch, Lemon peel, Frozen strawberries, Fat-free cream cheese, Pie Crust, 
Preheat oven at 350.  To prepare crust, prepare a 9" pie pan with cooking  spray and flour.  Place flour in a bowl and drizzle with oil. Use a pastry  blender to evenly distribute the oil and produce a mixture the consistency  of coarse cornmeal.  Sprinkle on the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and  continue mixing until you can gather the dough into a ball. Roll the dough  into a 11" circle onto a floured surface.  Patch any cracks that may form,  but otherwise try not to handle the dough more than necessary. Transfer the  dough to prepared pie pan.  Trim the dough, leaving a 1" overhang. Crimp  the overhanging dough into a decorative edge. Chill the crust 20 minutes.  To prepare filling, in a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar,  lemon peel, and juice until creamy. Spread mixture into pie shell and top  with fresh strawberries. In a saucepan, cook frozen strawberries, remaining  sugar, and cornstarch until bubbly then cook two minutes more. Cool  completely; pour over strawberries in pie shell. Chill.    Recipe By     : Country Home Magazine    From: Beck4@nyc.Pipeline.Com (Eileen An
