Orange juice, Brown Sugar, Orange, Cinnamon, Butter, Rome apples, Cranberries, 
1. Remove zest from orange. Mince half the zest, leave the other half in  strips- set aside. Mix cranberries, orange juice, brown sugar, and butter.  Divide this mixture in half. Stir minced zest into one half- set other half  aside.    2. From the stem end of each of apple, slice off 1/2-inch to form a cap.  Remove stem from each cap, and cut an opening large enough for a cinnamon  stick. Core each apple with a melon baller. Place apples in a small baking  pan and stuff each with a portion of the cranberry mixture containing the  zest. Replace cap on each apple, with a cinnamon stick through the old stem  opening. Pour remaining cranberry mixture around apples, stirring in  remaining zest strips.    3. Bake in a 350-degree oven until apples are tender, about 45 minutes.  Transfer apples to serving plates-, pour cranberry mixture from baking pan  into a medium saucepan and simmer over medium heat until reduced to a thin  syrup, 7 to 10 minutes. Spoon some of the thickened cranberry mixture  around each apple. Serve warm with ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.    Cooks Illustrated, Sept./Oct. 1994, Page 34.
