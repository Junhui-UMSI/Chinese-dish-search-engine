The following,  which I have NOT tested, comes from "500 Fat-Free Recipes", by Sarah  Schlesinger.    1.  Heat 1/4 cup of the broth or water in a heavy saucepan over medium  heat. Add garlic and scallions. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add more  liquid during this process if necessary.    2.  Add green pepper and mushrooms and saute for 5 more minutes.    3.  Add the remaining 1 3/4 cups broth and bring to a boil.  Stir in  cayenne, quinoa, and tomatoes. Return to a boil. Reduce heat. Cover and  simmer for 30 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed.    4.  Let sit for 5 minutes.  Add parsley and serve.    After typing in the recipe I read the nutritional analysis.  It says there  are 188 calories per serving, and 5 grams of fat.  That works out to 45  calories from fat, or abou 25%.  I dont see where that fat could come from  other than the quinoa itself.  Maybe there was supposed to be a decimal  point in front of the 5. According to Mastercook, Quinoa has 13.7% CFF.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #113    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
