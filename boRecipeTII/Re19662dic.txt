Another Garlic Soup Recipe
Beef stock, Pepper, olive oil, Croutons, Onion, Garlic, peeled & minced, Tomatoes, 
Combine garlic & onion in a bowl.  Heat oil in a large pot.  Add garlic &  onion & saute till soft.  Do not brown.  Add chopped tomatoes & stir in  well.  After a few minutes, stir in stock & pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes.  Add salt if desired.    Serve with croutons.    Source Unknown    One word of advice, though...it calls for one whole cup of garlic for one  quart of stock in this recipe.  My wife made this recipe, and Id  *definitely* recommend using less garlic than it calls for...probably  around 1/2 cup at the most.  We added more tomatoes than the recipe called  for.
