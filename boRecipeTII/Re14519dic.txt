Dredge pork chops in mixture of flour, salt, dry mustad and garlic powder.  Brown in oil in large skillet. Place browned pork chops in your CROCK -POT.  Add can of coup. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours. (High for 3 1/2  hrs)    YUM YUM!!!!! If you like onions you can also add them to the pork chops. I  did and it was very very good.    Glens NOTE: Recipe as posted called for "1/12 teaspoon dry mustard"! Dont  know if it should be 1-1/2, 1/2 or really 1/12 (which isnt a normally  valid recipe measurement).
