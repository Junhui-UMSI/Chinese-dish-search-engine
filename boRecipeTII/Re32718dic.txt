Sweet Potato Candy
Granulated sugar, sweet potatoes, Cinnamon, Light brown sugar, Fresh Lemon Juice, 
Scrub the unpeeled sweet potatoes and place them in a saucepan with water  to cover. Bring them to a boil, lower the heat, and cook until they are  fork tender. Remove them from the water and allow them to cool slightly;  peel them and put them through a food mill. Sift the sugar to remove all  the lumps. Place the sweet potato pulp in a heavy saucepan with the brown  sugar and lemon juice and cook over low heat until the mixture separates  easily from the sides of the pan, about 25 minutes. Allow the mixture to  cool, then flavor to taste with the cinnamon. Place it in the refrigerator  and allow it to chill for 1 hour. Form each candy by taking a small ball of  the sweet potato mixture, rolling it into a 1-inch log, and dusting it with  sugar. Wrap each log in waxed paper. They will keep 1 month stored in an  airtight container.
