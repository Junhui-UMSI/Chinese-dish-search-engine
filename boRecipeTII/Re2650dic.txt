Peanut Butter and Chocolate Balls
Powdered sugar, Semisweet chocolate; chopped, Corn flakes, Dry milk, Creamy peanut butter, Unsalted butter, 
1. Line cookie sheet with foil. Melt butter in heavy saucepan over low  heat. Combine cereal, peanut butter, dry milk and powdered sugar in large  bowl. Mix in butter. Moisten hand and roll into small balls (about the  diameter of a nickel). Place on prepared cookie sheet. Repeat with  remaining mixture. Chill uncovered overnight.    2. Line cookie sheet with wax paper. Melt chocolate in microwave, a small  amount at a time. Using toothpicks to pick up balls, dip balls and roll in  chocolate. Place on prepared cookie sheet. Refrigerate until chocolate is  firm.    (I use two big bags of chocolate bits, any variety and flavor. To store put  in airtight container in refrigerator.) Can be prepared 1 week in advance.
