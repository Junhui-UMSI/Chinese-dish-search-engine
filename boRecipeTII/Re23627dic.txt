Artichoke Appetizer
Parmesan cheese, marinated artichoke hearts, Mayonnaise, 
Chop up artichoke hearts (I put them in the food processor) and mix with  all of the other stuff.  Put in an oven safe bowl and bake @ 350 for 20  minutes or pop in the microwave for 4 minutes.    Dip what ever you like  I prefer wheatable crakers. Shared by Laura Aden  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #237    Date: Wed, 09 Oct 1996 08:20:35 -0700    From: Gerald Edgerton <jerrye@wizard.com>
