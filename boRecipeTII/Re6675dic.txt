Polenta Primavera
Garlic, Zucchini, Mushrooms, Salt, Onion -- chopped, Fresh or dried marjoram,, Eggplant -- (optional), Water, Cornmeal, Red bell pepper, Fresh ground pepper, Oregano, basil, 
Bring water to boil in heavy pan.  Lower to simmer. Add corn meal in VERY  FINE STREAM, stirring constantly. Once all of meal is added, keep stirring  until the mush pulls away from the sides of the pan or you feel you are  going to start screaming uncontrollably ( It helps to listen to something  very compelling while doing this, either a spouse, SO, the radio, or a  political demonstration). Pour immediately onto a flat plate, a cake tin,  or a tart pan. Smooth top and cool for 30 minutes until firm.    Meanwhile, saute onions and garlic until lightly brown in olive oil. Add  chopped vegetables and seasonings, cook until soft. Pile, with juices from  veggies, onto polenta. Spread around. Add any seasonings you want and  enough cheese to cover if you want (which is why I didnt put in amounts).  Broil or nuke until melted and toasted sort of on top. Eat warm or cool.
