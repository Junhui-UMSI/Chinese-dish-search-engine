Ultimate Supremo Cold/flu/fever/sinus/bronchitis Remedy

1 red ripe chile 1 clove garlic, raw & peeled 1 cubic inch fresh ginger  root 1 lemon, lime or grapefruit, Fresh squeezed juice from (up to 3) 1 tsp  honey, up to 1 tbsp (optional) 2 cups pure water    Put all these ingredients into your blender and liquefy. You could strain  it if desired, although; 1) its probably healthier to drink the pulp, and  2) if you bought yourself a Vita-Mix, the Mother of All Blenders (no, I  dont sell them, Im just a happy owner), you could liquefy all the pulp  into relative non-existence. The best thing to do with this is drink it  down on an empty stomach, taking the time to swirl it around in your mouth  and mix it well with saliva, followed immediately by a nice, long, HOT bath  with vinegar added to the bathwater (the idea being to open up all the  pores and sweat as much as possible), and then go to bed. Ive done this  and it seems to speed up my recovery time tremendously.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #221 by "Richard J. Ertl & Regina  Chien-Ertl" <rjerace@concentric.net> on Jan 25, 1997.
