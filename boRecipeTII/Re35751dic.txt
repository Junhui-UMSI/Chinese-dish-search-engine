Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Mushroom Sauce
Hot water, (10 3/4 oz) condensed cream, Dill weed, Margarine, cut in pieces, Boneless skinless chicken, Melted margarine, (6 oz) Stove Top Chicken, Water, Egg, 
My family really enjoys this recipe, which I got off the back of a box of  Stove Top Stuffing.    Heat oven to 400 degrees. Stir hot water, 4 tablespoons margarine and  contents of vegetable/seasoning packet in bowl until margarine is melted.  Add stuffing crumbs and egg; stir until moistened. Spoon stuffing onto each  breast; wrap chicken around stuffing. Place seam side down, in greased  shallow baking dish. Brush with melted margarine. Place any remaining  stuffing in center of dish. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until chicken is  thoroughly cooked. Heat soup, water, and dill in saucepan. Serve over  chicken. Makes 6 servings    I reduce the water to 1 1/3 cups, as I find that the stuffing is too moist  otherwise. Also, I omit the dill weed, as I do not have it on hand.
