Cran-Apple Sauce
Fresh cranberries, Apples; peeled, cored and, Sugar; I used a little less, Apple juice, Ground cinnamon or mace;, 
I got this recipe from a flyer handed out with the fresh cranberries I  bought in Eagle River, Wisconsin several weeks ago at the annual Cranberry  Festival. Ive made this several times already. Delish.    Yield: 4 cups    Source: Country Woman Magazine    Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat,  cover and simmer for 15-25 minutes, until the apples are soft. Can be  pureed in a food processor, if you prefer. (I left chunky.)    Cover and refrigerate. This was delicious hot just after it was made.    note - I also added a cinnamon stick while it was cooking. Sugar could be  reduced to 1/4 cup, if desired, depending on apples used. The cranberries  are very tart, so some sweetener is needed.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Oct  20, 1998,
