PASTRY CRUST (VEGAN)    1 cup all-purpose flour								 3/4 t salt												 1/3 cup light corn  syrup							 2 T Rice Dream								    The crust for this pie worked reasonable well.  The rim of the crust turned  rock hard and was essentially inedible (looked pretty, though). But the  crust that was under the pie was moist and very edible.  Not flaky, of  course (you need oil to get a flaky crust), but a very servicable and  decent crust.    Mix together all ingredient in a bowl and shape into a ball.  Try to work  the dough as little as possible.    Place the ball of dough between two sheets of wax paper that have been  dusted with flour.  Roll out the ball of dough between the sheets until it  is large enough to line a 9-inch pie pan.  You may need to stop midway and  re-flour the paper to keep the dough from sticking.    Slightly grease a glass 9-inch pie plate (with 1/4 t of oil or a quick  squirt of non-stick spray).  Carefully place the crust in the pie plate.  Crimp the dough around the rim so it looks nice.    Set aside.    Posted by Michelle Dick <artemis> to the Fatfree Digest [Vol. 11 Issue 28],  Oct. 28, 1994. FATFREE Recipe collections copyrighted by Michelle Dick  1994. Used with permission.
