Baking soda, Flour, Chopped walnuts; (about 4, Eggs, Pureed cooked or canned, Cinnamon, Ground ginger, Light brown sugar, Stick (4 oz.) plus 3 tbsps., Baking Powder, Ground mace, 
Preheat oven to 325oF. Before starting batter, wash 8 (1-pt.) wide-mouth  canning jars with lids in hot soapy water and let them drain, dry, and cool  to room temperature. Generously grease insides of jars. With an electric  mixer, beat together butter and about half of brown sugar until light and  fluffy. Beat in eggs, then remaining sugar. Beat in pumpkin. Set aside.  Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and  mace.    Gradually add to pumpkin mixture in thirds, beating well after each  addition to make a thick batter. Stir in walnuts. Spoon 1 level cupful of  batter into each jar. Carefully wipe rims clean, then place jars in the  center of preheated oven. Bake 40 minutes. About 10 minutes before cakes  are done, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Put in jar lids,  cover, and remove from heat. Keep lids in hot water until theyre used.  When cakes are done, remove jars from oven one at a time. If jar rims need  cleaning, use a moistened paper towel. Carefully put lids and rings in  place, then screw tops tightly shut. Place jars on a wire rack; they will  seal as they cool. Makes 8 cakes.    Recipe by: MAILING LIST 1995    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 442 by ctlindab@mail1.nai.net on  Jan 3, 1998
