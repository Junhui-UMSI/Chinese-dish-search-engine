You may substitute pork shoulder or beef chuck for the lamb. Use beef stock  for beef, chicken stock for pork or lamb. Basic stew: Trim meat of fat and  cut into 1-1/2" chunks. Bring all ingredients to boil in 4-qt pot, cover  tightly, reduce heat, and simmer 2-1/2 hours, until meat is tender.  Crockpot directions: pile all ingredients into crockpot and cook all day on  LOW. When done: skim off and discard fat. It takes less than 8 minutes to  assemble this stew. Then you can pay it little or no attention as it  simmers for about 2-1/2 hours. Make multiples of the basic stew, then  divide stew into 4-serving portions; refrigerate or in airtight containers  for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in microwave-safe  container on defrost or in refrigerator for 24 hours. To assemble: bring  basic stew, vegetables, and spices to boil in 3-qt pot. Reduce heat, cover,  and simmer 15 minutes, stirring twice, until vegetables are almost tender.  Whisk chicken stock with flour until blended. Stir into stew and simmer,  uncovered, 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until gravy is slightly  thickened and vegetables are tender. This stew is also good made with beef  or pork.
