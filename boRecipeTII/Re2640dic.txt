Peanut Butter #2
Peanuts, 
From Cuisinart operating techniques and recipes.     Process up to 2 cups of nuts with chopping blade, letting the machine run  continuously.  After 2-3 minutes, the ground nuts will from a ball that  gradually smooths out.  Scrape the sides of the dowl and contonue  processing until drops of oil are visible. Taste for consistency. The  longer you process the softer the butter will be. For chunky style, add a  handful of nuts just after the ball of nut butter begins to smooth out.  Store in the refrigerator to keep from separating.     For cashew nut butter, add a small amount of bland oil.
