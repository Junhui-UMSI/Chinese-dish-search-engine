In large bowl, whisk warm water with sugar. Sprinkle in yeast; let stand  for 10 minutes or until frothy. Whisk in oil and salt. With wooden spoon,  briskly stir in 4 cups flour to make a soft dough.    Turn out onto lightly floured surface; knead for 8 to 10 minutes, adding  enough of the remaining flour to make dough smooth and elastic. Place in  lightly greased bowl, turning to grease all over. Cover with plastic wrap;  let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about 45 minutes, or until double  in bulk. Punch down dough.    Divide dough into 8 pieces; roll into balls. Cover and let rest for 10  minutes. Gently stretch or roll each piece into 12 x 8 inch oval.    Topping    Brush egg white evenly over top; sprinkle evenly with salt and poppy seeds.  Back at 400 degrees F for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Let cool. Serve whole or  in pieces.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 658 by "Diane Geary."  <diane@keyway.net> on Jan 31, 1998
