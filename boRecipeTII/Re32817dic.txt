If you serve this to guests it is odds on no-one will know what the soup is  based on. It is also a good bet that there will be takers for seconds.    Wash, peel and cut into chunks 500 g white-fleshed sweet potatoes and boil  until tender. Drain well and set aside.    Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan and saute 1 onion, finely  chopped, until transparent. Meanwhile pour boiling water over 4 tomatoes in  a bowl, leave for 2 minutes and drain. Peel the tomatoes (the skin will  pull off easily) and chop them. Add tomatoes to the onions and cook for  about 5 minutes until soft.    Into a blender or food processor put the sweet potatoes and the tomato  mixture. Add 300 ml beef stock and puree. Return to the saucepan, add a  further 600 ml stock, adjust seasoning to taste and reheat. Finely chop  half a bunch of coriander leaves. Ladle the soup into bowls and scatter the  coriander over the top.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg    From an article by Meryl Constance in The Sydney Morning Herald, 4/27/93.
