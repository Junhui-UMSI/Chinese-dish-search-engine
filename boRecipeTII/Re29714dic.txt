Tea-Smoked Chicken Drumettes
Loose tea leaves, Dry sherry, Chicken drumettes (about 16), Soy sauce, Honey, Finely chopped fresh, Clove garlic, peeled and cut, Brown sugar, 
1. Put the chicken into a gallon-size zip-top food-storage bag. Combine the  soy sauce, sherry and honey, whisking to blend. Stir in the ginger and  garlic. Pour over the chicken, close the bag and place in a bowl.  Refrigerate overnight.    2. To smoke the chicken: Combine the brown sugar and tea leaves. Line a wok  or wide, heavy pot with heavy-duty aluminum foil, leaving hems of at least  3 inches. Spread the smoking mixture in the bottom of the pan. (It would be  best to use an old pot that could be used just for this purpose. Or use an  old metal baking or roasting pan and put across 2 burners.)    3. Remove the chicken from the marinade; discard the marinade. Then place  chicken on a rack that will fit over the pan. Set the rack in place and  turn the heat to medium-high. Wait for the mixture to begin smoking and  cover with foil, crimping the bottom hems with the top piece of foil so the  pan is tightly sealed. Reduce heat to medium and smoke the chicken about 45  minutes, or until cooked through. (If you need to have more than 1 layer of  chicken, rotate pieces about half-way through the cooking time.)
