Antipasto Misto (Mixed Savories)
Cubes of different cheeses, Raw; marinated, or pickled, Pickles; fruit, and olives, Chunks of smoked sausage, Rolled salami, Pickled herring, Sardines, 
Cut the above ingredients into bite-sized chunks and put them on toothpicks  or bamboo skewers. Refrigerate until ready to serve.    To Serve: Stick skewered savories into a large, round, domed loaf of bread  (a purple cabbage works well also). Arrange greens under the loaf on a  large, wooden board or platter.    This becomes a conversation piece and a way for guests to try new taste  combinations. Make sure all items are well drained before spearing them  into the bread. Leave a small dish for discarded toothpicks.    NOTES : I made this for the MUUF Pledge Dinner.
