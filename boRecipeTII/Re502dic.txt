Dissolve jelly powder in boiling water in bowl.  Stir in salt and sugar.  Add cold water. Whisk or beat in salad dressing to combine. Chill until  slightly thickened. Beat with rotary beater until fluffy.    Fold in cabbage, carrot, celery, cucumber and onion. Pour into mold or  serving bowl.  Chill.    Note: Jelly may be completely set then put in a blender to fluff before  adding vegetables.  It will make it nice and airy but it wont increase the  volume as much.
