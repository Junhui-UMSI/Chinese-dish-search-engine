The taste of this soup is somewhere in between the colonies and American  Upper Yuppie. You decide. I like it!      Heat a 4-quart pot and add the oil. saute the garlic, celery, and onion  until the onion is clear. Add the flour, cooking and stirring over medium  heat for a few minutes to form a roux. Add the stock and stir with a wire  whip until the mixture begins to thicken. Add the remaining ingredients  except the cream, salt, pepper, and scallops. Simmer, covered, for 1/2  hour, stirring often. Add the cream and season to taste with salt and  pepper. Add the scallops and heat just a few minutes. Do not overcook the  scallops. Serve immediately.     NOTE: A very small amount of freshly grated ginger will bring some  additional Yuppie flavor to this dish.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
