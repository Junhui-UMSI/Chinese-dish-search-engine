Phils Chile Mouthwash and Throat Spray
Vodka, Habanero powder, Water, 
I my earlier post today I failed to mention that I filtered the diluted  solution prior to using it. I made a filter paper cone by folding a 6" X 6"  piece of a paper towel and inserted it into a kitchen funnel. This resulted  in an amber colored liquid free of visible particles. I wanted to avoid the  tickle of powder residue stuck to the back of my throat after using the  gargle method. The particles in an unfiltered solution would probably clog  the sprayer also. Here is the recipe with complete method:    Place the Hab powder in the bottom of a small glass and add vodka. Cover  the glass and let it rest for about an hour during which time a deep amber  color will develop. (My Hab powder is reddish brown.) Add the water to  dilute. Filter to remove chile powder particles. It is now ready to use.  Yields 2 oz.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #295 by "W. Phil Cody"  <76422.1413@compuserve.com> on Jan 31, 1998
