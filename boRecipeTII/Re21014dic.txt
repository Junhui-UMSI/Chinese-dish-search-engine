From: mlhenson@stlnet.com    Date: Thu, 18 Jul 1996 23:17:59 -0500  A spin on the garden salad, I make a taco salad, using TVP or veggie  burgers cooked with diced onions and taco seasoning (Chili Man Taco  Seasoning is perfect if its available in your area.) I layer that in the  bottom of aluminum roasting pans. Next, I chop the lettuce, tomatoes,  onions, and layer those, as well. I cover everything with low-fat taco  chips, crushed.  In the corners of the pan, I insert large plastic cups  filled with sour cream, guacamole, jalapenos, and banana pepper rings so  that people can add them or avoid them - to their liking. In place of the  TVP, you might make some refried beans. For the dressing, I use salsa; I  heat that and put that off to the very last so people can ladel it onto  their salad as they wish - the hot salsa wilts the lettuce just a little  bit, but makes the salad extra yummy for some reason. (Oh, I suppose you  could add cheese, as well, for the cheese lovers.)    fatfree digest V96 #199    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
