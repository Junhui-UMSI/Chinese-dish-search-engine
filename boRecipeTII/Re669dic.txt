*Kosher, crushed    1. Puree the carrot and celery with 3 cups of the water in a processor. Put  this into a large pan and add the balance of the water.    2. Heat the oil in a skillet, add the garlic, and stir- fry over low heat  for 2 minutes, just enough to change the color. Add this to the soup pan.  Bring to a boil over moderate heat and skim off and discard the foam that  accumulates.    3. Add the potatoes and cook over low heat for about 45 minutes. The  potatoes will begin to disintegrate. At this point, remove the pan from the  heat and mash the potatoes in the pan with a hand masher or ricer. Bring  the soup to a boil again, add the salt, lemon juice, consomme cubes and  tumeric.    4. Simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour more, stirring frequently to prevent  the potatoes sticking to the pan. the soup will have turned a golden color.  Adjust the salt and lemon juice should you wish a more intense flavor.    Serve hot in a soup plate with as much rice as wanted. Variation: Should  you prefer, use 6 cups homemade chicken broth instead of water and  eliminate the consomme cubes.
