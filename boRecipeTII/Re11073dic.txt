Rainbow Stew
Cornstarch, Sugar, Cold water, 
Here are a few recipes that I have. Most of them come from a cookbook  called The CDL Family Cookbook.    In cooking pan, mix ingredients, in above order. Heat mixture until it  begins to thicken, stirring constantly. Cool. Divide into 3 equal portions  in mixing bowls. Add one color of food coloring (red, yellow and blue) to  each bowl. Put one big spoonful into a ziploc bag, so that each bag has all  three colors. Seal it with duck tape. Let your children knead it to make  various colors. This is really cool.
