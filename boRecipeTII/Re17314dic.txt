Waldorf Salad
Seedless raisins, Lettuce leaves, Red apples, Lemon juice, Sticks of celery thinly, Mayonnaise, Walnuts, 
Put mayonnaise in a large bowl and stir in the lemon juice. Set aside.  Halve and core the apples, but do not peel them; chop into bite-size cubes.    Add the apples to mayonnaise dressing and stir until the pieces are well  coated. Add celery, walnuts and raisins into the bowl and mix gently.    Arrange the lettuce leaves on a large serving plate and spoon the salad  onto the center.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Yolanda de Ortega <yillingw@GYE.SATNET.NET> on  Sep 13, 1997
