Cover the apricots with the apple juice and bring to a full boil.  Reduce  the heat and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.  Stir the apricots occasionally  so they will not stick or burn.  Let the apricots cool, then strain.  Reserve the cooking liquid.  Chop the cooked apricots and set aside.  In a  2-quart saucepan combine the orange juice, honey, water, cornstarch, ginger  and cinnamon.  Heat, stirring constantly, until thickened slightly. Remove  the pan from the heat and add the apricots, their cooking liquid and  vermouth.  Serve hot or well chilled.  From: Syds Cookbook.
