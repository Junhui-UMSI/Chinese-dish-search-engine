Bagna Cauda (Garlic Dip)
Garlic, Anchovy, olive oil, Pepper, Butter, 
Heat the oil and butter together in an earthenware pot over hot water or in  a double boiler. In another pan cook the garlic in a bit of the oil until  it is soft. Add the anchovy fillets, and cook until the fish dissolves into  a paste, about 5 minutes. Add all to the pan of hot oil and butter. The  Bagna Cauda is kept hot in the middle of the table. Guests dip celery,  cooked and cooled artichokes, endive, cucumbers, green onions, and Italian  bread into this mixture.
