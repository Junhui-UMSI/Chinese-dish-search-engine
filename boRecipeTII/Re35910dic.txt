Stuffed Mushrooms
Sour cream, Onion, Extra Large Fancy Mushrooms, Minced Green Pepper, Bread crumbs, Sliced Ripe Olives, GARNISH, 
Preheat oven to 325F.  Remove the stems from the mushrooms and reserve  them for another recipe. If you want you can mince some of the stems and  include them with the stuffing mix.  Combine the bread crumbs with the sour  cream and mix until well blended.  Add onion and green peppers.  Mix well.  Fill each mushroom cap with the stuffing mix and place on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 20 - 30 minutes or until hot.  Remove from oven.  Garnish with  sliced olives and serve as a great appetizer.  CAUTION:  Since mushrooms  contain a large amount of water it is necessary for these little beauties  to cool a little before eating.  The very hot water in them can cause burns  to the mouth and then your guests cant enjoy the entree?. From: Syds  Cookbook.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/sydsbook.zip
