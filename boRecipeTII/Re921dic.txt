>From "The German Cookbook" by Mimi Sheraton    Boil potatoes in their jackets in lightly salted water to cover. Do not  overcook or potatoes will fall apart in salad. Peel while hot and cut in  thin slices. Fry bacon and when golden, but not brown, add onions. Saute  slowly until onions become translucent but not golden. Remove from heat and  carefully pour in combined vinegar and stock/broth. DO THIS CAREFULLY so  liquid does not cause hot fat to splutter. Bring to a boil and pour over  potatoes a little so dressing runs over them evenly. Fold in a couple  tablespoons sour cream if you like, or serve without it. Sprinkle with  parsley.
