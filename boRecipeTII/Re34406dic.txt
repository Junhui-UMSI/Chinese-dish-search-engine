Refrigerate until serving time.    In medium bowl with fork or in food processor bowl with metal blade, mash  beans well. Add bread crumbs, garlic powder, ground red pepper, pepper, egg  whites; mix well. Mixture will be soft. With wet hands, shape mixture into        4    patties, 1/2 inch thick.    Spray pan in medium nonstick skillet . "Fry" bean patties 5 minutes over  medium heat. Turn and flattten slightly with pancake turner; cook and  additional 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated and set. Serve in buns with  sour cream sauce.    I also tried mine with a sprinkle of nonfat cheese, which was also yummy.    Makes 4 sandwiches.    fatfree digest V96 #198    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
