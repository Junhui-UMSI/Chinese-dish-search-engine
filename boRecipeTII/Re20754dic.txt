Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle a third over apples. Repeat  layers of pastry, apples and cinnamon-sugar twice. Roll out remaining dough  to fit top of dish and place on top. Using a sharp knife, cut 2 inch slits  through all layers at once. For syrup bring water and sugar to a boil. Cook  and stir until sugar is dissolved. Pour over top crust. Bake at 400 F. for  35-40 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Serve warm with whipped topping  or ice cream if desired. Garnish with mint if desired.    Yield: 12 servings.
