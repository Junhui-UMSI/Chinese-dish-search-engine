Apple-Ginger Upside-Down Cake
(packed) golden brown sugar, Ground ginger, Eggs, (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, Salt, Ground ginger, Granny Smith apples (about, (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, Vanilla extract, Minced crystallized ginger, Cream, CAKE, Whole Milk, Chilled whipping cream, Sugar, TOPPING, Minced crystalized ginger, (packed) golden brown sugar, Plus 1 1/4 cup all-purpose, 
(Bon Appetit, January 1998)    For topping: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 F. Butter  9" diameter cake pan with 2" high sides. Melt butter in small saucepan over  medium heat. Add sugar and cook until mixture bubbles, about 3 minutes.  Remove from heat. Stir in ground ginger. Pour mixture into prepared pan,  spreading with spatula to distribute evenly. Tightly overlap apples atop  sugar mixture making 2 layers of apples. Sprinkle crystallized ginger atop  apples. Set aside.    For Cake: Mix crystallized ginger with 1 tbl flour in small bowl. Sift 1  1/4 cup plus 3 tbl flour, baking soda, and salt into medium bowl. Using  electric mixer, beat brown sugar and butter until light and creamy. Beat in  eggs 1 at a time. Beat in vanilla. Mix in sifted dry ingredients  alternately with milk. Stir in ginger mixture. Spoon butter atop apples in  pan. Bake cake until brown on top and tester inserted into center comes out  clean, about 1 hour. Cool cake in pan on rack 15 minutes.    Whip cream, 2 tbl sugar, and ground ginger in another medium bowl to soft  peaks.    Run small knife around edges of pan to loosen cake. Place platter over cake  and invert cake onto platter. Serve warm or at room tempereature with  cream.  I halved this recipe and it worked out very well. Id imagine you can use  peaches, pineapple, apricot, pears, etc. The softer fruits might need  adjustments for dry ingredients. And, of course, it took 4 stores to find  crystallized ginger in New York City!    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Jessica Chaiken <jessc@IX.NETCOM.COM> on Dec  29, 1997
