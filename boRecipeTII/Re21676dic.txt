Peel, core and slice apples thinly. Use a food processor to slice apples,  since this makes the job easier. 1/2-inch slices should be about right.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease sides of 9 x 13-inch baking  pan. Prepare Streusel Topping:  In medium bowl, mix flour, pecans, brown  sugar, slightly softened butter, vanilla and cinnamon until mixture comes  together. Shape into a ball.    Prepare crust:  Into large bowl, measure flour, sugar and salt. Cut in 1/2  cup cold butter into small bits. With fingertips, blend butter into flour  mixture until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press evenly into bottom of  baking pan.  Bake crust 15 to 20 minutes our until golden. Crust may crack  slightly but dont worry.  Place apple slices  in 10-inch skillet. Add  raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon and 3 tablespoons butter. Cook 15 minutes  over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender. In cup,  mix cornstarch and lemon juice. Stir lemon juice mixture into apple slice  mixture and cook until thickened. This should happen quickly. Remove from  heat. Spoon apple mixture over crust. Break Streusel Topping into chunks  and scatter over apple mixture. Bake 30 minutes or until streusel is  browned. Cook completely, in pan, placed on wire rack. When cold cut into  16 pieces and serve. Serves 16. 284 calories per bar, according to  MasterCook.
