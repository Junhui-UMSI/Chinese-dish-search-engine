Toltott Tojas (Stuffed Eggs)
Eggs; hard cooked, Mustard, prepared, Milk, whole, Salt, Butter, unsalted; softened, Parsley; minced, Pepper, black; to taste, Roll, 
Cut off a slice from the top of each each just large enough to be able to  take out the yolk.    Soak the roll in milk, squeeze it, and force through a sieve or puree in  a blender. Mix with softened butter, mustard, parsley, salt and pepper to  taste. Mix in the yolks until the stuffing is smooth, then stuff into the  whites and put back the slice you cut off.    Variation - Mix 1 tablespoon paprika well with 1 tablespoon milk, then  mix with 1 cup sour cream. Add a little salt if you like.
