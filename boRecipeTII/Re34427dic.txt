INTRO: Serves 4. This simple but delicious and nutritious soup is one you  would often find on the table in China. Use soft bean curd: its  custard-like texture and mild flavor works with the sugar to neutralize the  metallic edge of the spinach. The bean thread noodles give substance to  this warming dish.    PREP: Soak the noodles in a large bowl of warm water for 15 minutes. When  soft, drain them and discard the water. Cut the noodles into 3-inch lengths  using scissors or a knife. Remove the stalks from the spinach and wash the  leaves well. Gently cut the bean curd into 1-inch cubes.    Put the stock into a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the bean thread  noodles and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the spinach and the rest of the  ingredients except the bean curd. Simmer for 2 minutes, then gently put in  the bean curd. Continue to simmer the soup for 2 more minutes to heat the  bean curd through and serve at once.    Source: Asian Vegetarian Feast (HardCover 1988) by Ken Hom. William Morrow  and Company, Inc.
