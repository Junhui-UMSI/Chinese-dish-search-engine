EMERIL LIVE SHOW #EM1A38    Preheat the grill. Season the fish with salt and pepper. In a large saute  pan, combine the fish stock, wine, onions, thyme, bay leaves and garlic  cloves. Season the liquid with salt and pepper. Bring the liquid up to a  simmer. Add the whole fish and poach for about 8 to 12 minutes. After the  first 8 minutes, stick a paring knife into the back of the fish and try to  gently pull back the flesh from the bone. If the flesh sticks to the bone,  poach for a couple of minutes more. Keep testing until the fish is done.  Toss the vegetables with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place  the vegetables on the hot grill and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each  side. Remove from the heat and julienne the vegetables. Place the tomatoes  in a blender and puree with the garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, basil and  mustard. Season the sauce salt and pepper. To assemble, place the julienne  vegetables on a large plate. Lay the poached fish on top of the vegetables.  Spoon the sauce over the top. Garnish with parsley.
