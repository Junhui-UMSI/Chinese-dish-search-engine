Kathy Pitts Pot Roast - Crockpot
Dehydrated onion soup mix, Onion, Fairly lean pot roast, 
Place half the onion in bottom of roast.  Rub the roast with the soup mix.  Place roast in pot, and top with remaining onion. Cover and cook on low  heat for at least 12 hours.  Do not panic and add water--it will make its  own juices.    You can add carrots or potatoes to the roast.  Just be sure to place  vegetables in the bottom, so they will absorb the juices.
