Tomatillo Sauce (Cooked)
Tomatillos, Fresh cilantro, Sugar, Onion, Salt, Cold water, Garlic, Jalepeno peppers, Salad oil, 
Remove outer husk from tomatillos. Cook in 4 cups water for 10 minutes.  Drain. Place in blender container with 1 cup cold water, garlic, peppers,  onion, and cilantro. Puree until almost liquid. Heat oil in saucepan and  pour in sauce. Season with salt and sugar. Lower heat and simmer 5 minutes.  If too sour, add another tsp. sugar. Variation: for a sauce with a  "toasted" taste, heat the tomatillos on a heavy skillet or griddle, turning  frequently, until the husks are quite brown and the fruit is soft. Remove  the husk and use the tomatillos. Do not puree the sauce for a chunkier,  salsa-type sauce.    Excellent with poultry, pork, or beef, burritos, tacos, chicken enchiladas  and tostadas.
