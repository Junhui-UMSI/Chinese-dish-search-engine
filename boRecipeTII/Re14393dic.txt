Whole Wheat Bread
Sugar, Dark molasses, Warm water, Brown sugar, Dry yeast, Whole wheat bread flour, Salt, White bread flour, Buttermilk; warmed, Vegetable oil, 
Mix yeast, water and 1 teaspoon sugar to bubbly stage. Mix rest of  ingredients and yeast mixture; let set 12 to 15 minutes before working in  more flour. Let rise until double in warm spot for about 1 hour. (You can  warm oven a few minutes and raise dough in there.) Shape into 4 loaves and  rise again in well greased pans, bottom and sides. To get air bubbles out,  use a rolling pin before shaping loaves. If you want a soft crust, brush  with butter or shortening while loaves are hot.
