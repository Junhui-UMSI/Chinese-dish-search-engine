Start rice cooking. Note: Spices are on the mild side. Rinse & cook lentils  and potatotes (approx. 25-30 min.) When done, drain & set aside. Use plenty  of water to cook lentils. While lentils are cooking, toast garlic. (Pile  garlic in corner of a heavy, non-stick pan. Put a few drops of olive or  other good-flavored oil over it. Toss garlic in the oil until coated.  Saute, keeping careful watch, until the garlic is toasted. Gives a  wonderful flavor and aroma to the food and your kitchen!). Add onions to  the toasted garlic and saute in stock or water until they are just  translucent.  Add chopped tomatoes. Make 1 cup of stock in a 2 cup  measuring cup. Add tomato paste to the stock. Mix well. Add spices, tamari,  vinegar, honey, etc. to that mixture and blend. Spice measurements are  approximate and on the mild side. Add liquid to sauted onions. Add stock or  water as needed & continue simmering. When lentil-potato mixture is cooked,  drain and mix it into the saute. Add green peas & cook another 5 minutes.  Add salt & pepper to taste. Optional: Add chick peas, Braggs liquid (in  lieu of salt if needed).
