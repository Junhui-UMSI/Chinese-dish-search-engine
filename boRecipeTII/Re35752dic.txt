Season chicken breasts with pepper and salt. Combine rice, tomato, cheese,  italian seasoning, choppped onion, and cayenne pepper. Spoon rice mixture  on top of pounded chicken breasts; fold over and secure sides with wooden  toothpicks soaked in water. Wipe off outsides of chicken breasts with paper  towel. Coat a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high  heat until hot. Cooked stuffed chicken breasts 1 min. on each side or until  just golden brown. Transfer chicken to shallow baking pan. Since I had  extra rice mixture, I lined the bottom of the casserole with leftover rice  and placed the chicken breasts on top. Bake at 350 F for 15 min. Note: I  did not have Wehani rice so I used 3/4 cup jasmine rice cooked in water.  After the rice was cooked I added 1 Tbsp salt free chicken base to the rice  mixture. Carole Walberg    NOTES : A great dish for entertaining.  Each chicken bundle comes with a  surprise inside.  It looks like you worked all day. Green peppers and  mushrooms can be added to the rice mixture as well.
