Sesame oil, Chicken broth, Dry sherry, Ground pork, Fresh ginger, Rice vinegar, Garlic, Scallion, Green beans, Salt, Hot red pepper, Sugar, Soy sauce, Vegetable oil, 
In a small bowl; combine soy sauce, chicken broth, sherry, sesame oil,  vinegar, sugar, salt, & hot pepper; set aside. In a wok or 12-in. skillet,  heat veg. oil until very hot but not smoking. In 2 batches, fry green beans  over high heat, turning often with kitchen tongs, until bright green & just  beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer beans to paper towels to  drain. Discard oil remaining in wok.    Reduce heat to medium. Add pork, garlic, & ginger & cook, stirring to break  up lumps of meat, until pork loses its pink color, about 3 minutes. Add  green beans & stir-fry 1 minute longer. Stir in reserved sauce & cook until  liquid isalmost evaropated, about 1 minute. Transfer to a serving dish,  sprinkle scallion over top.    This recipe also works well if you use 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a nonstick  wok or pan.    Posted to recipelu-digest by RecipeLu <recipelu@geocities.com> on Feb 15,  1998
