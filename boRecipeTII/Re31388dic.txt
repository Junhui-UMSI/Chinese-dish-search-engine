Barbara Kafkas Gazpacho
V-8? vegetable juice, Garlic, olive oil, Kosher salt, Sweet onions; quartered, Chili powder, Green bell peppers; cut into, Tomatoes; cut into 8 pieces, Cucumbers; peeled and cut, 
With the metal blad ein place, add the onion to the beaker. Process,  turning on and off rapidly, until finely chopped, about 4 or 5 seconds.  Transfer onion to a large bowl.    Repeat with cucumbers, then green peppers, and then 5 of the tomatoes.  Transfer all to the large bowl.    Process remaining tomato with garlic, V-8, olive oil, and chili powder  until a smooth liquid is formed. Combine with chopped vegetables and chill  in a covered container.    Before serving, taste for salt. If texture is too thick, add more V-8, or a  combination of V-8 and beef bouillon.    Makes 1 1/2 quarts.    NOTE: Make this soup at least a couple hours before serving, so the flavors  have a chance to combine. Overnight is even better.    NOTES : Delicious.  Ive adapted this over the years - little or no olive  oil, but more V-8 or Clamato juice - or a combination (1/2 and 1/2) of V-8  and beef bouillon . It tastes terrific with seasoned croutons. Its a very  nice thing to have in the refrigerator during the heat of the summer.
