Chow-chow is a vegetable relish that is put up at harvest time when an  excess of vegetables is on hand. The word is thought to stem from the  Chinese who came over to work on the railroads and may be a derivation of  the word choy, which is Cantonese for vegetables. Combine all the  ingredients from the cabbage through the salt in a large heavy pot or dutch  oven.    Mix the cornstarch with the mustard and vinegar in a bowl until smooth. Add  to vegetable mixture. Heat to boiling, reduce the heat and simmer,  uncovered, stirring frequently, for 1 hour. Pour into sterilized jars and  seal. Store in a cool place.
