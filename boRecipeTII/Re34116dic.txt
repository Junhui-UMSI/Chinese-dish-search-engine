Sift together the baking powder, flour and  salt. Combine the egg, water, and lemon juice and beat until frothy. Stir  this into the dry ingredients just until blended. Add butter. Dip onion  rings into batter, a few at a time. Drop into 375 deg. F. oil. Fry 2  minutes on each side, turning once. Drain on absorbent paper. Keep hot in  slow oven (325 deg. F.) until all are cooked. Dont crowd them in the  fryer.
