Omar the Pieman has been vending pies since 1964 after he left sailing the  high seas as a merchant marine. He and his wife, Haneefah, decided to  provide for their family in a traditional way by baking delicious homemade  pies and cakes.    In August of 1964 Omar left on his first route through the historic streets  of New Orleans French Quarter. As he went along shouting, "Pieman, pieman  ... delicious, fresh-baked pies," his outgoing and friendly character, as  well as his pies, became known and enjoyed by French Quarter residents.    In his 20 years of business, Omar the Pieman, has been vending in the  French Quarter, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Bastille  Celebration and now finally from his own little "home, sweet home" kitchen  in The Marketplace. Throughout the week from 9:30 to 5:30 his son, Omar  Ibn, delivers trays of velvety smooth pies baked daily by his mother,  Haneefah (the lady behind the scenes). She was once quoted, "I wont let  one pie out of my sight unless the crust melts in my mouth and the fillings  are at their best."    Taken from the sadly out-of-print New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival  Cookbook, copyright 1984. Mix the potatoes with rotary beater until they  are smooth. Then add the other ingredients to the potatoes and beat for 5  minutes. Pour filling into unbaked 9" pie shell, bake for 40-45 minutes at  350-325. Can also be served with a favorite topping: hot rum sauce, ice  cream or whipped cream.
