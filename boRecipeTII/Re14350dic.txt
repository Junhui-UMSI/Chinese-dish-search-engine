Squeeze orange, reserve the juice. Put the peel, including the white pith,  in the blender with the milk, eggs & butter. Work till peel is very finely  chopped.    Sift flour & salt with baking soda; add sugar, nuts & raisins. Add blended  mixture to dry ingredients, stir well.  Pour batter into prepared pan; bake  for 45-50 min, till the cake tests done.  Remove from the oven; sprinkle  the reserved orange juice over the hot cake, leave in the pan till cool.    N.B. You can use orange liqueur instead, as a sprinkle, or a combination  thereof. Note that because of the moistness, the cake needs to be  refrigerated after the first cut, since it will get mouldy more quickly.
