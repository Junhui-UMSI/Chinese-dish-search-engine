Stick Cinnamon, Sugar, Boiling water, Pickling Salt, Cider vinegar, Powdered Alum, (2 gal) Green Tomatoes *, Handful Cloves, 
*   Green tomatoes should be fresh picked and sliced.    Arrange the tomatoes in layers in a large bowl or pickle crock, sprinkling  the salt between the layers.  Let stand overnight. The next day, drain,  sprinkle with the alum, and pour the boiling water over them. Let stand for  20 minutes.  Drain, rinse, and drain again. In an enamel or stainless steel  preserving kettle combine cider vinegar, sugar and the spices, tied in a  cheesecloth bag. (The spice bag should be kept in the syrup right up to the  very end.)  Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar  is dissolved and boil  rapidly for 3 minutes.  Pour the syrup over the tomatoes and let stand  overnight.  Next day, drain off syrup and bring to a boil. Pour over  tomatoes and let stand again overnight. On the fourth day, put syrup and  tomatoes into the kettle, bring to a boil and simmer until the tomatoes are  transparent.  Pack the tomatoes into hot jars. Boil the syrup until it  becomes quite thick or spins a long thread. Remove the spice bag and pour  the syrup over the fruit, filling the jars and seal. Makes 8 Quarts.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #198    Date: Wed, 14 Aug 1996 11:47:27 -0400    From: marie@FreeMark.COM (Marie Slone)
