Preheat the oven to 350~.  Thoroughly grease 6 individual ramekins or  custard cups with 1 tbsp of the butter. Place the flaked salmon in a bowl.  Add 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs, the scallion, dill, lemon zest, egg, and  cream.  Mix gently with a fork.  Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne  pepper.  Divide the mixture among the buttered cups and pack it down  slightly. Top the croquettes with the remaining 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  Dot with the remaining tbsp of butter.    Arrange the cups in a roasting pan.  Pour in enough hot water to come  halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake until fairly firm and set, about  30 mins. Cool for 5 to 10 mins. The croquettes can be unmolded, right side  up, or served in the ramekins. Top each croquette with sour cream and  caviar, or simply garnish with lemon.    Author - Peggy K. Glass
