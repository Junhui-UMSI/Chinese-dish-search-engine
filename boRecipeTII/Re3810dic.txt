This is a side dish, not a stuffing for the inside of a bird. My dad always  makes this (as did his mother before him) at holidays, but theres never  been a recipe written down. I consulted with my dad, and wrote this down  while making it for a party last weekend. Except for the amount of curry I  use, which is about double the amount he uses, I think the recipes pretty  authentic. I chose egg substitute (Egg Beaters brand) rather than fresh  eggs, because I knew it would be sitting around on a buffet table for a  while.    Mashed potatoes: Boil potatoes in enough water to cover. When theyre  fairly tender, drain and mash with butter and milk. Add the pepper. The  mashed potatoes will be fairly thin. Set aside.    bread mixture: In a large frying pan, melt the butter and add the onions,  celery, sage, and curry powder. When the vegetables are wilted, add the  bread cubes and continue to fry over medium heat until all the butters  absorbed. Add more butter if the bread cubes seem too dry.    When the stuffing mixture is done, combine with the mashed potatoes and the  parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste. Finally, add the eggs or egg  substitute, stir thoroughly to combine. At this point if its too dry, you  can add more milk. The bread absorbes quite a bit.    Bake until heated thoroughly in the oven in a buttered casserole. Serves at  least 8 generously.
