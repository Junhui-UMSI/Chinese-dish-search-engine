Baked Bean Soup
Cold baked beans, Onion, Stalks celery with leaves, Sugar, Butter, Water, Flour, Salt, Stewed and strained tomatoes, Chili sauce, Pepper, 
Put beans water, onion, and celery in saucepan; bring to boiling point, and  then simmer 30 minutes.  Rub through a sieve, add tomato, chili to tomato  mixture.  Cook together and heat through.    Mustard and/or horse-radish was also used by the Hancock shakers to season  Baked Bean Soup .  Serves 6    Note:  I used Bushes canned beans because they resemble homemade bake  beans.  I thought that this was a really wonderful, simple Saturday night  soup to whip up.
