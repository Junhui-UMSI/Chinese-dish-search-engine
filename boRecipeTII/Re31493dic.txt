Sweet-And-Sour Coleslaw
(about 1/2 medium head) red, Sugar, Vegetable oil, Rice wine vinegar, Kosher salt or 1 teaspoon, Celery seeds, Black Pepper, Carrot; peeled and grated, 
I cant believe it. I wrote this weekend requesting information about no  more watery coleslaw as discussed in an old Cooks Magazine. Well, I just  found that lonely magazine in a corner of my bookshelf. I saved it knowing  that it was good information. The secret to good coleslaw is to presalt it  until the cabbage wilts, 1-4 hours. Then you need to rinse it and pat it  dry.    Since rice wine vinegar tends to mellow, you may want to use cider vinegar  if making the slaw a day ahead. The presence of the sugar in this recipe  keeps you from having to rinse off salt from the cabbage as is ordinarily  the case.    1/ Toss cabbage and carrots with sugar, salt, and celery seeds in colander  set over medium bowl. Let stand until cabbage wilts, at least 1 hour and up  to 4 hours.    2. Pour draining liquid from bowl; rinse bowl and dry. Dump wilted cabbage  and carrots from colander into bowl.    3. Add oil and vinegar; toss to coat. Season with pepper to taste. cover  and refrigerate until ready to serve. (Can be refrigerated 5 days.)
