A crustless quiche of spinach, with Swiss and cottage cheeses. This is  always a favorite, and is so versatile it can be used in a number of  different settings - as a vegetable, for luncheon, as an entree, or even as  a first course. When teamed up with a tomato salad and crusty peasant  bread, it makes a light, yet filling repast.    1. Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Butter a 1-1/2 quart casserole.    2. Combine the cottage cheese, eggs, butter and Swiss cheese in a large  mixing bowl.    3. Add the spinach and flour and blend thoroughly.    4. Transfer the quiche mixture to the prepared casserole. (The pudding may  be prepared 6 to 8 hours in advance up to this point and refrigerated.  Return to room temperature before baking.) 5. Bake for 60 minutes until the  custard sets. Let cool for 10 minutes before cutting into portions and  serving    6 to 8 side-dish portions; 4 to 6 luncheon portions    Recipe By     : The Uncommon Gourmet by Ellen Helman    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
