Beef Jerky
Salt, Beef brisket, Soy sauce, Ginger powder, Garlic powder, Onion powder, Brown sugar, pepper, Worcestershire Sauce, 
Trim ALL fat and cut the brisket into 1/8 inch thick strips.  Mix all  remaining ingredients in a large bowl.  Dip each strip individually to  ensure complete coverage.  Place the meat back in the marinade, cover and  allow to marinate in the fridge for at least 12 hours.  24 is better. Place  strips in smoker and smoke for 8 to 10 hours with 2 pans of Alder. Store in  the fridge in a 2 quart sealer with a ventilated lid. This jerky may also  be cooked in the oven.  Prepare the meat the same as above. After  marinating, place meat on a rack on a cookie sheet. Cook in a 150 F. oven  for 8 to 12 hours.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Lorne Ottway" <lottway@hotmail.com> on Nov  27, 1998
