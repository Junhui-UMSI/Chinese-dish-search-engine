Quick Strawberry Ice Cream
Unsweetened strawberries;, Sugar, Fresh Lemon Juice, Light cream or, 
Put all the ingredients in the food processor and process until combined,  the cream and strawberries forming a soft billowy cream with bits of berry  visible. Scrape down the sides once or twice with a rubber spatula. Put the  ice cream in the freezer in a covered container to firm up a little before  serving.    NOTES : This ice cream is surprisingly delicious, considering how little  time and effort it takes.  The berries must be frozen individually rather  than a block, and the cream must be very cold.  It is best if eaten soon  after it is made.  Soften any leftovers in the refrigerator before serving.  You can make this ice cream with other berries and cubed fruit so long as  they are frozen in individual small pieces.
