Grease  each popover cup generously with soft butter or solid vegetable shortening.    Combine ingredients in a blender or food processor; process about 40  seconds.  Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times  and blend until mixture is completely smooth.    To make by hand, whisk together the eggs, milk and butter in a large bowl.  Add the flour and salt and beat until very smooth. Pour into greased cups,  filling half to two-thirds full.    Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.  Do not open the oven door  during baking or the popovers will collapse. Makes 6 to 8, depending on the  size of the baking cups.    Cornmeal Popovers:  Substitute/4 cup flour for the flour.    Cheddar Cheese Herb Popovers:  Add 1/4 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese  andspoon dried rosemary to the recipe.    Nut Popovers:  Add 1/4 cup ground nuts to the batter.
