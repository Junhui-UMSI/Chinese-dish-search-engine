Raisin-Pecan Scones
Sugar, Flour, Butter or margarine, pecans, zest of 1/2 lemon, Baking Powder, Salt, Baking soda, milk, 
In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients as well as the lemon zest, if  using. Cut in butter until crumbly, then stir in nuts and raisins. Mix in  milk and work into a soft dough. Turn out onto floured surface and knead  lightly about 10 times, then pat about 1" thick and cut out rounds with a  cookie cutter or glass. Place on an un-greased cookie sheet, if you like  brush the tops with milk, and bake at 425? about 12 minutes.    Posted to recipelu-digest by Kara9718 <Kara9718@aol.com> on Mar 28, 1998
