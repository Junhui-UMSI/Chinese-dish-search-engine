Cut about one inch off the top of the melon; reserve. This will later serve  as a lid.  Clean out the inside of the melon and discard seeds. With a long  handled spoon, scoop out 1 cup of the center pulp and chop.    In a heavy skillet, heat butter over moderate heat. Add the meat and onion;  saute until browned, stirring frequently. Add the rice, pine nuts,  currants, 1 tb. sugar, cinnamon, salt, chopped melon pulp and water; mix  well.  Cook until liquid in the pan is absorbed, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat; cool to room temperature.    Sprinkle the inside of the melon with the remaining 1/2 tb. of sugar and  spoon the meat stuffing into it. Cover with the reserved top; secure with  wooden picks. Place in an oiled baking pan just large enough to hold the  melon comfortably.  Bake at 350 F. for one hour, or until tender.
