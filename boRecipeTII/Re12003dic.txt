Zesty Szechwan Salmon
Oyster sauce, Dark soy sauce, (4-oz) salmon steaks; 1", Dry sherry, Minced fresh ginger, Vegetable oil, Thinly sliced green onions;, Fermented black beans, Peanut oil, Cornstarch, Chicken broth, Garlic, 
Combine cornstarch and sherry; add peanut oil, black beans, ginger, garlic,  broth, oyster sauce and soy sauce. Stir until well blended (or process in  blender or food processor until blended). Set aside. Prepare a bed of hot  coals or preheat broiler. Adjust barbecue grill 4-5 inches above coals;  position oven rack so fish will be 4-5 inches below heat source. Lightly  grease grill or rack. Cook about 3 minutes, then rotate 1/4 turn and cook  2-3 minutes longer to create a crisscross pattern. Turn fish over, cook  other side same way (total cooking time is 10-12 minutes). To check  doneness, pierce center of salmon with a fork; if flesh is opaque and  flakes readily, fish is done. Dont overcook! Place fish on warmed plates  and top with a few spoonfuls of sauce, letting it run over edges. Garnish  with green onions. Makes 6 servings.
