Veau Dans Le Chaudron (Veal Pot Roast)
Garlic cloves, cut in half, Onions - medium (6-8), Pepper, Savory, Thyme OR:, Bay leaf, Bacon fat or salad oil, Salt, Veal - 1/2 leg or:, Potatoes - medium (6-8), 
Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2 cloves of  garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place the meat in the  hot fat and brown well on all sides. Dont rush this as the colour and  flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how well the meat has been  browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay leaf. Place the potatoes and  onions, whole around the meat. Dont add any liquid. Cover tightly and cook  over medium heat till meat is tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and  oniions will not break as there is no liquid added. The veal will make its  own gravy. When cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter.  Place the pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another minutes or  so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.
