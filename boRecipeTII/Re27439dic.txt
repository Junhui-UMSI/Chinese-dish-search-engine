From: davysk@ruakura.cri.nz (Karen Davys)    Date: Sun, 24 Apr 1994 16:29:10 GMT  Someone wanted a recipe for Toffee Apples, I think they called them Candied  Recipe.  This recipe is from The Edmonds Cookery Book - New Zealands No. 1  Cookbook.    Boil together without stirring until a drop snaps in cold water. Remove  from heat and dip in apples on skewers, stand apples on greaseproof paper  until dry.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
