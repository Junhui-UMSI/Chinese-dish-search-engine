Although this is not absolutely authentic, its quick (unlike most Indian  dishes), and easily made for a delicious approximation of the real thing.  Adding the optional ingredients helps the flavor, but a quick-and-dirty  onion-garlic-curry powder-ketchup-chick peas version isnt too bad, either.     Fry the onions in oil at medium-high heat until golden and translucent,  2-3 minutes. Add garlic, fry for a minute. Add cinnamon, cloves and  cardamom, fry for a minute (until the kitchen begins to smell really  good!). Now add the curry powder to the onions, fry for a minute or two. As  the mixture begins to stick, add the ketchup to make it more pliable. Keep  on frying for about 5 minutes, stirring fairly constantly. Once this "base  masala" is ready (one hint is if the oil starts separating from the  mixture), just add the chickpeas, including the water they are in. Stir to  mix, heat until it boils, then cover and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook  for 15 minutes, take off heat and stir in coriander leaves. Serve hot, with  heated pita, tortillas, Indian bread (roti, naan or puri) or rice.     NOTE: McCormicks or other American "curry powder" just isnt as good as  the powder you can find in Indian stores. In case you are finicky and an  Indian store isnt easily available, a fair approximation can be made with  1/2 tsp. corinader, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. turmeric, 1/4-1/2 tsp. hot  chile powder.
