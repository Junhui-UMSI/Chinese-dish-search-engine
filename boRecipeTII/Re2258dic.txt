Rinse and sort through peas, drain. Place in a 4-5 quart oven proof  casserole. Add other ingredients, cover and bake in a 300deg F. oven until  meat is tender when pierced (3-4 hours).    Lift meat from soup, cover pan and return to oven to keep warm (OK turn off  oven at this point). Discard bone and any fat, tear meat into bite size  pieces. Return meat to casserole, stir well and season to taste with salt  and pepper.    Makes 6 servings.    P.S. I usually bake a 10# bag of whole potatoes along with this soup,  taking them out as done. Some we eat right away, some fried for breakfast  the next day, and some are split, stuffed and frozen for use later as  twice baked potatoes.
