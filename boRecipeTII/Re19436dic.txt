* TVP = Textured Vegetable Protein, check your local health food stores.    Toast chiles in wok/cast iron skillet until they start to smell roasted.  Make sure you dont burn them. Open them and discard seeds and membrane.  Cool.    Toast the whole seeds and cinammon on low in wok/skillet till you smell the  roasted smell and cumin is a few shades darker.  Do not burn them.  Cool  down.    Put everything except TVP and liquids into a spice mill and grind.  You  will probably have to do it in batches. (You may use a blender also, but  then add the liquid before blending.)    Put TVP in a container. Add spice mixture and liquid and pressed garlic.  Stir. (If TVP isnt fully reconstituted after 20 minutes--use your  intuition--add some stock, stir, wait another 10 min, and check again.) Add  oil.    Stir. Cover well, and stick in your fridge for about 2 days. Really do  this. The flavors need to blend. You might want to stir it once or twice a  day.    For one serving suggestion, mix with boiled , cubed potatoes.    Variations: Please experiment with the proportions of the spices. Adjust  the wine/vinegar/water ratios if youd like, but keep the liquid total at 1  1/2 cups. Also, using crumbled tempeh or ground seitan instead of tvp would  also be intresting.    jonathan kandell, tucson, jkandell@ccit.arizona.edu    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
