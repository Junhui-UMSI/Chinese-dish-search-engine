Tuna Custard Casserole
tuna, canned, Mayonnaise, milk, salt and pepper, celery, Eggs, Bread, 
Mix tuna with mayonnaise; add celery and onion. Put 4 slices of bread in a  shallow, well greased dish. Spread the tuna mixture over the top with  remaining bread. Beat milk and eggs; pour over casserole.    Refrigerate until needed: bake at 350 for 30 minutes.    Id never thought of "bread pudding" as a main dish until I found this  recipe about 10 years ago.
