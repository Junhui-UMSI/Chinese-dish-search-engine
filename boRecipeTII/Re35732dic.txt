Wash mushrooms and cut off stems. With stainless steel or plastic teaspoon,  scoop out mushroom heads. Store covered so they wont stain.    Put eggs, mayonnaise and the cut off mushroom stems in blender or food  processor and shred slightly, so mixture doesnt loose all its texture.    Place mushroom heads upside down on greased baking sheet and fill with  mixture. Top up with the grated cheese. Bake or grill until cheese is  completely melted and starts to turn brown. Garnish with shredded basil  leaves.    Greetings from yehuda paradise Ramat Gan, Israel
