21-Day Wine
Sugar, Grape Juice; Canned, Not, Whole 15 Cent Balloon, Cranapple Juice, Distilled Water, Whole Yeast Cake, Jug (Sterilized), 
1. Mix juices and sugar in a large bowl so after the sugar dissolves well  it will be easy to funnel into a jug.    2. Dissolve yeast in a little lukewarm water and than add to the jug.    3. Cap the jug with the balloon. (be sure you save the original cap for the  jug. You will need it later.)    4. The balloon will gradually expand as the wine "works." Remove the  balloon on the 21st day and its all ready for serving. Suitable to serve  with meals.    Be sure to read notes.    NOTES : Helpful hints:  Sterilize your jugs well.  Measure the yeast  accurately and be sure to use lukewarm water to dissolve the yeast.  Hot  water will kill the action.
