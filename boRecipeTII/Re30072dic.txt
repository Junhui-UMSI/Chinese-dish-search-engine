Blanch onions in boiling, salted water 30  seconds; drain. Slice off the root end. "Peel" the onions by pressing them  slightly between your fingers; the inner part will slip out of the papery  skin.    2. Whisk together oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Put onions in a roasting  pan, add oil-vinegar mixture, and toss to coat well. Bake until tender  (about 25 minutes). Remove from oven and let cool in pan. Taste; adjust  seasoning as necessary.    3. To serve, place 2 onions and 1 cheese cube on each cocktail skewer.  Makes 24 to 30 skewers.    NOTES : Tiny pearl onions turn sweet and soft when roasted with oil and  vinegar, especially a vinegar as mellow and rich as Italian balsamic. The  onions can be roasted a few days ahead; the cheese can be cubed and wrapped  in plastic a day in advance. The cheese will cube better if cold, but both  onions and cheese taste better at room temperature.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MasterCook recipe list.
