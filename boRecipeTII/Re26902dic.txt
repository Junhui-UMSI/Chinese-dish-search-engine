Combine the skim milk, egg white and pepper to  make a seasoned egg wash.    Dip the fillets into the egg wash, then dredge them in the bread crumbs.  [Let sit for 10 minutes.]    Lay the fillets on a nonstick baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.    NOTE:  For me this dish is a marvelous replacement for fried fish.    Sauce:  Combine all ingredients and refrigerate in a tightly covered  container.    NOTES:  This sauce will keep for a week if stored as suggested. Use this as  you would regular tartar sauce with any dish. Try it as a replacement for  mayonnaise on sandwiches and in salads.
