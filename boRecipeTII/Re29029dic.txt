Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Beat butter until soft. Gradually add the  sugar and blend until creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time. In a bowl,  combine raisins, currants, and pecans and sprinkle lightly with flour. Add  these ingredients to the butter mixture. Combine breadcrumbs, cinnamon,  cloves, and allspice; stir these ingredients into the butter mixture. Bake  in a greased tube pan or baking dish for about 1/2 hour. Serve with about 1  cup Hard Sauce.    Hard Sauce:    The basic ingredients of hard sauce are always the same, although  proportions and flavoring may vary. In this recipe, the larger amount of  butter is preferable. An attractive way to serve hard sauce on cold cake or  pudding is to chill it and mold it with a small fancy cutter--or put it  through and individual butter mold.    Sift the powdered sugar. Beat butter until soft; add sugar gradually. Beat  well until ingredients are well blended. Add the salt and flavoring. Beat  in the egg or cream. Continue to beat until sauce is very smooth. Chill  thoroughly.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 01 Aug 96    Date:    Fri, 2 Aug 1996 10:46:58 -0500    From:    LD Goss <ldgoss@METRONET.COM>
