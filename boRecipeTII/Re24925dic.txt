Authentic Mexican Rice
Vegetable oil, Onion, RECIPE CAN BE DOUBLED, Long-grain white rice, Salsa, Tomato chicken boullion, Water, 
Heat oil in saute pan on medium-high.  Add uncooked rice and stir to coat  rice with oil. When rice is brown, add chopped onions and stir. When onions  start to brown, add in salsa tomatoes, stirring to coat rice. Add in water  and chicken-tomato seasoning and bring to a boil. Allow water to boil for 5  minutes, then lower heat to medium-low and cover.  Simmer for 10-15  minutes, stirring every few minutes.    When water is completely evaporated and rice is tender, remove from heat  and serve hot.    * NOTE:  Embasa Salsa comes canned and can be found in the ethnic section  of your grocery store. This is an authentic recipe from a Hispanic friend  of mine.    Contributor:  Frances Say    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by frances.m.say@bakernet.com on Apr 23, 1998
