Potato Poblano Soup
bacon, Garlic, Poblano chiles, Anejo cheese, Fresh black pepper, Chicken Stock, Yukon Gold potatoes, Crema, Salt, Onion, 
In a heavy Dutch oven or stockpot, fry the bacon over moderate heat,  stirring frequently, until it starts to brown. Toss in the onions, half of  the diced Poblanos, the salt and pepper and cook until slightly golden, 5  to 7 minutes. Spoon out any excess fat. Stir in the garlic and cook briefly  just to release the aroma, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock, add  the potatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook 20 minutes.  Puree in a food processor or blender just until smooth, being careful not  to over-process. Over-working will result in a gummy soup. Return to the  pot, stir in the Crema, Creme Fraiche or sour cream and bring just to a  boil. Stir in the remaining Poblanos for garnish. Sprinkle with grated  Anejo, if desired, and serve hot.
