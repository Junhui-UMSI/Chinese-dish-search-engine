MikeNote; Salt Cod, soak for 24 hours and Gently  rinse, to remove most but not all of the salt. Do not  break up fish. Put the potatoes in a large pan of  cold, salted water, cutting any large potatoes in half  or quarters first. Bring the water to a boil and  simmer until the potatoes are just tender when pierced  with a fork, 15-20 minutes. Drain and when cool enough  to handle,, peel away the skin. Set aside. In a heavy  pan such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over  medium heat. Add the onions, reduce the heat to very  low and slowly saute about one hour. Stir  occasionally, watching that the onion doesnt burn. A  few dribbles more of oil may be necessary. Pre-heat  oven to 300F degrees. Turn up the heat, add the garlic  and tomato and cook, stirring constantly until the  mixture becomes thick and the liquid is substantially  reduced, about 10-15 minutes. Add the ham, parsley,  pepper, cinnamon and cloves, then gently stir the cod,  potatoes, jalapenos and their juice into the tomato  mixture. Transfer to a 1 to 2 quart casserole,  preferably clay, sprinkle with the olives and bake for  30 minutes. Bacalao a la Viscaina can be made ahead  and re-heated in a 300F oven for 20 minutes or until  thoroughly hot.
