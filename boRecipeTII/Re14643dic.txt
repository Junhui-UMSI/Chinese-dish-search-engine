"Pizza" Bread
Salt, Bread flour, Water, Dry yeast, 
Place into the bread machine in the order given. Place on dough or pizza  cycle. Both work well. Remove when finished and shape into a round in a pie  pan which is oiled. Let rise approximately 30 minutes. For pizza  bread...put finger holes in top. Rub with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Bakeat 400 degrees 20-25 minutes. (This produces a flatten bread which I  believe ended up being named Foccaccio! with some additional toppings.) For  a loaf of bread, I do the same thing, except that I do not punch holes in  the top. I lightly rub the top with olive oil...not necessary and bake at  400 degrees. For pizza....this will yield two pans of thin crust. Top and  bake this at 425 degrees.    NOTES : This bread is not good baked in the bread machine.
