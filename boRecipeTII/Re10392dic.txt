Quick Chili Con Carne
Canned red kidney beans, Meat Sauce Mix (recipe) --, Chili powder -- or to taste, Thawed, 
Combine ingredients in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until  heated through, about 15 minutes.    Lindas notes:   A combination of beans makes this more interesting; black  beans or canned pinto beans are nice additions.
