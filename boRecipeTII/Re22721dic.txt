Apricot Kugen
Halved apricots; pitted, Lemon juice, Sugar, Vanilla, Flour, Ground cinnamon, Sour cream, Butter or margarine, Cornstarch, Eggs, 
With a mixer, beat butter and 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Add 4 eggs, one  at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in flour.    Spread batter evenly in a 9 by 13 inch pan.    Mix apricots with 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Arrange fruit,  cut side up, in batter.    In a bowl, mix remaining sugar with cornstarch, add sour cream, remaining  eggs, and vanilla; beat until blended. Pour over apricots.    Bake in a 350 degree oven until cake surrounding apricots in the center is  firm when gently pressed, about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Let cool at least 30  minutes; serve warm or cool. NOTES  : I have used my frozen apricots and it works well.  Recipe by: Sunset Magazine, June, 1997    Posted to recipelu-digest by "Susan Mori" <bonaparte@email.msn.com> on Mar  17, 1998
