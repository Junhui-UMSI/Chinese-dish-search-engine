Tofu Provencal
Canned plum tomatoes w/juice, Pepper; to taste, Firm tofu; patted dry, Diced green beans, Dried basil, and cut into 1/2" cubes, Garlic, Dried Oregano, Tomato paste, Onions; chopped, Bay leaf, (chopped), 
Heat a bit of oil in large skillet.  Stir fry tofu until golden. Remove  from pan and drain.    Saute garlic and onions for about 5 mins.  Add tomatoes, their juice and  tomato paste, stir until blended.    Return tofu to pan, add remaining ingredients and toss thoroughly. Cover  and simmer 15 mins or until green beans are tender. If sauce is too thin  boil uncovered to reduce.    We LOVE this quick simple dish; sometimes I will substitute Zukes, or  squash, or mushrooms for all or part of the tofu. Enjoy.    A quick easy companion dish:    One box of NEAR EAST Bulghur Pilaf and some fresh mushrooms.    Slice mushrooms and add to sauce pan.  Pour on water needed for Pilaf and  bring to a boil add NE mix and simmer 15 minutes. It is GREAT!
