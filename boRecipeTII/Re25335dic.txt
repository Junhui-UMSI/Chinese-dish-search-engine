Note: I just finished typing this to save in my fat notebook that is my own  personal cookbook. It is filled with recipes that my family likes. I  started the notebook when Rebekah was two years old, and every recipe in it  has been made, tested, and family approved.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 13 Feb 97 by "Sharon H.
