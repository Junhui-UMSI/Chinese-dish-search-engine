Apple Cranberry Pie
flaky pie dough, egg wash, FILLING, tart apples, Sugar, Cranberries, Flour, Cinnamon, lemon zest, unsalted butter, 
To form the pie crust, remove dough from refrigerator and place on flat  work surface. Roll dough, still between sheets of plastic, to a 12-inch  disk. Peel off top piece of plastic and invert dough into 9-inch pie pan.  Gently press dough into pan and peel off top piece of plastic. Trim off  excess dough even with edge of pie pan. Chill crust while preparing  filling.      Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the lowest level. For filling, peel, halve and core apples. Cut apples into 1/2-inch dice. Place  diced apples in a bowl and add filling ingredients, except butter, tossing  well to combine. Place filling in dough-lined pan, mounding it slightly in center. Dot filling with butter.      For the top crust, lightly flour work surface and dough and roll to a 9 by  12-inch rectangle; cut each piece of dough into 12 strips, each 9 inches  long and an inch wide. Egg wash the strips and arrange five of them, equidistant from each other, on the top of the pie, allowing the excess dough to hang over the edge of the pie. Place five more strips  perpendicular to the first ones on the pie. Trim away excess dough at the  edge of the pie and apply the last two strips to the edge of the pie, egg  wash side down. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush with egg  wash. If you wish, sprinkle the top of pie with sugar.      Bake the pie for 15 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven. Lower the  temperature to 350 degrees and move the pie to the middle rack. Bake the pie about 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is a deep golden and the  juices are just beginning to bubble up.
