Pumpkin Biscuits
Sugar, Warm water, Active dry yeast, Butter, Hot milk, All purpose flour, Pureed pumpkin or winter, Salt, 
Combine hot milk, butter, sugar, pumpkin, salt and 1/4 cup flour in a large  bowl. Stir yeast into 1/4 cup warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or  until bubbly.  Add yeast to the first mixture and beat vigorously. Cover  and leave in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes or until light. Stir in  2-3 cups flour until dough leaves sides of bowl. Turn out onto a floured  surface and knead in flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 8  minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning it to grease the top. Cover  and place in a warm draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45  minutes. Punch dough down, and turn out onto a lightly floured board. Roll  dough with a rolling pin to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2 inch rounds.  Place rounds about 1 inch apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let  rise for 20 minutes or until almost double in size. Bake in a preheated 400  F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. HINT: Place bottom pan  on top oven rack and top pan on bottom oven rack after first six minutes of  baking to ensure even brownness. Bakers note: This recipe rates four  stars.  It has a wonderful flavour, and a nice golden brown colour. It  would be good to serve at Thanksgiving dinner.
