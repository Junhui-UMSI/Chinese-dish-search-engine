Use sweet bread setting on breadmaker.    Tip for grated lemon peel: When I use a lemon or an orange, I peel the rind  with a potato peeler and save the pieces in the freezer. Every so often, I  grind the frozen peels in my food processor, and save the resulting stuff  in the freezer. Its easy to remove the amount required whenever you need  it.
