The caramel: Heat the sugar for the caramel in a small, heavy frying pan  over low heat until it begins to dissolve. Shake the pan slightly (do not  stir) until all the sugar has melted. Increase the flame and let the sugar  bubble and color.  Pour the caramel into the mold and quickly turn it  around in all directions, tipping it up in a circular motion until the  surface - bottom and 2 inches up the sides - has been lightly coated with  the caramel.  If the caramel thickens and becomes sluggish, gently heat the  mold in a pan of hot water or over low heat, depending on the material, and  continue the coating action.  Set aside to cool.    Put the milk, salt, sugar, and cinnamon or vanilla into a saucepan and  bring slowly to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Continue  boiling slowly, taking care that it does not boil over, until the milk has  reduced by about 2/3 cup.  Set aside to cool.    Place an oven rack on the lowest rung of the oven and heat to 325 F.    Beat the eggs and yolks together and stir into the tepid milk. Pour the  mixture through a strainer into the flan mold and place it in a hot water  bath in the oven. Test after 2 hours with a skewer or cake tester; if it  comes out quite clean, the flan is cooked. Remove from the oven, but allow  to sit in the water bath for about 15 minutes longer. Remove and set aside  to cool completely before refrigerating.
