Penne Arrabiata
Onion, chopped coarsely, Bacon, or 2 Tbsp. olive oil, Serrano chili peppers, (1 to, Italian tomatoes, or 1-8 oz, SAUCE, Garlic, 
Cut bacon into 1 inch pieces. Saute. Add garlic and onion to the bacon (or  olive oil if using that) and saute lightly. Dice the Roma tomatoes (or open  the can of sauce!) and add to the sauteed onions and garlic. Also add the  hot peppers/sauce at this time. Turn heat to low. Simmer the tomatoes until  the sauce is nicely thickened. With fresh tomatoes this could take a half  hour. Add salt to taste. Cook the dried pasta in boiling water until done.  Drain. Serve immediately placing a few tablespoons of sauce on top of the  pasta. This isnt Ragu or Prego, so dont pour it on too thickly. In this  case, less is better. Note: the sauce is especially tasty if it can be made  several hours ahead. The flavors develop better. Also, the bacon really is  essential to this dish. It adds an interesting taste dimension that the  olive oil doesnt have. It adds a smoky dimension to it; it is really  indescribable. It is very tasty without the hot peppers also. We usually  add the peppers at the table rather than in the cooking.
