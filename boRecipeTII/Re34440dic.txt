Bean Curd with Oyster Sauce
Cornstarch paste, Garlic, Chicken Stock, Premium oyster sauce, Soy bean curd (canned or, Peanut oil, Peanut oil, Fresh), Green onions, Sugar, 
Slice bean curd into 1/4" cubes; sliver green onions.  In hot wok, heat oil just to point of smoking.  Add  bean curd, green onions and garlic. Stir gently to  avoid breaking up curd; turn pieces to coat with oil.  Be sure oil is not too hot or curd will tend to stick  to pan.    When aroma of garlic is apparent, add stock and bring  to boil. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 30  seconds (dont let curd fall apart). Remove cover;  stir in oyster sauce and sugar. Increase heat, and  when liquid boils again, add enough cornstarch paste  to make a creamy (but not too thick) sauce. Swirl in  peanut oil to make a glaze. Serve over rice or in a  shallow serving bowl.
