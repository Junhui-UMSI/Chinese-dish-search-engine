TO MAKE DOUGH: Mix flour with warm water and knead for 10 to 15 minutes.  There is no need to add any flour on the board as you knead because the  dough should be at a perfect consistency. Let dough rest for 20 minutes  while you make the filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Partially thaw spinach and  lightly squeeze out liquid (leave some liquid with the spinach). Mix with  rest of ingredients. WRAPPING: Divide dough into 4 parts. Roll each part  out to about 12 inches in length and divide into 12 balls. Roll each ball  into 3 inch round flat discs and drop 1 tbsp. of filling in center. Fold  the dough over the filling, pinching together just the top to make a half  circle. On the side nearest you, form 2 to 3 pleats on each side and pinch  them to meet the opposite side to seal.
