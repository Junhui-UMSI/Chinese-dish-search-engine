recipe leona davis submitted by marina #1434    Directions: cream crisco, brown sugar, white sugar, 4 beaten eggs, and  vanilla together. In a seperate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking  soda, and salt. Mix dry ingedients to blend. Add, rice krispies, rolled  oats, coconut, pecans and chocolate chips.    Begin adding dry ingredients to creamed crisco mixture, this mixture will  get stiff, and unless you have dough hooks, it will become necessary to mix  by hand.If needed add a Tablespoon of water to moisten just a bit After you  have added all ingredients and they are well blended. roll dough into small  to med balls and place  on cookie sheet. Flatten dough with fork, and Bake  at 325 F. for 8 to 10 minutes.    NOTE: this makes at least 8 doz. cookies. I have made the recipe and  refrigerated  dough during the holidays.( great for those of us who like  hot cookies and milk. I also have cut recipe in half and that works well  for me. This recipe is quite old and given to me by an aunt of 76 years  old. When she said by hand after working in some of the dry ingredients she  means BY  HAND, said get right in  there and toss the dough around blending  it well.    Marina phx. az.
