This recipe is just what it claims to be, a simple poaching job on a  low-class fish. However, this process raises the fish to glory! Remember  that we are dealing with very few calories here, and the flavor and texture  taste like something very expensive!      In a 6-quart soup pot bring the above ingredients, except the butter and  the fish, to a boil. Place the fish in the poaching liquid and simmer,  covered, for 8-10 minutes. The fish is done when it barely begins to flake.      Do not overcook the fish. Serve with melted butter and salt and freshly  ground black pepper.      I like this along with Pasta with Fresh Asparagus and Scallops (see  recipe).    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
