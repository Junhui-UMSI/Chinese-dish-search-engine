She makes it for every  Thanksgiving and it occupies a place of honor on her dessert table next to  Gails pecan pie.   She has embellished on her original recipe by making  the crust out of pulverized oreo cookies (with the filling) instead of  graham cracker crumbs.    Do try the chocolate pie both ways, with the graham cracker crust and with  the oreo cookie crust.   For the oreo crust, the filling helps to bind the  crumbs.
