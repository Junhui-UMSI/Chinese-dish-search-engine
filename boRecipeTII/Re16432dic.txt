Weizen? Why Not?
Williams wheat extract, Cascades hops (boil), Honey, Crystal malt, Toasted barley, Cascades hops (finish), Wyeast wheat yeast, 
Make a 2-quart starter before brewing. Steep crystal and toasted  barley in  4 gallons water for 40 minutes (use grain bags to make this  easier). Add  extract,  honey and bittering hops. Boil wort for 1   hour.  Remove from  heat.  Add  finishing hops and steep 2 minutes.  Chill  and  pitch yeast.  After 3 days, rack to secondary. Bottle after 8 days. This beer was a bit  cloudy and should have some Irish  moss.  Im  not really sure what the  honey added to this beer (more experimentation  is in order). However, it  turned out so well that I wont omit it  in  the future. This was a very  good  extract-based  recipe  (it  well  nigh evaporated).
