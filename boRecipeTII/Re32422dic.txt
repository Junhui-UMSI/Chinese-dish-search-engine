submitted by: HANRE@aol.com (Hanadi, Kuwait)  Here are some of my favorite recipes. I hope youll enjoy them as much as  my family does.    Prepare syrup by putting the sugar and water in a heavy saucepan. Bring to  a boil while constantly stirring to desolve the sugar.    Let it boil until it appears clear. Add few drops of lemon and let it boil  for a min. or so. Remove from saucepan and let it cool completly.  Preheat  the oven to 350xF.    In a bowl combine all the remaining ingredients and stir until well mixed.  If you are going to bke in a pan then oil it before you pour the batter. If  you want to do bite size pieces then line the mini muffin pan w/ the paper  cups and pour in them the batter.  Decorate the surface w/whole blanched  almonds or w/ pine nuts.  Bake until golden.    Remove from oven and pour some syrup on each and return the pan to the oven  for a few min. to dry the surface.
