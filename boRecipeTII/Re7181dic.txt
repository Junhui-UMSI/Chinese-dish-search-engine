Place meat in Dutch oven. Add 1 gallon water and bring to boil. Reduce heat  and simmer, covered, until meat is half-cooked, about 35 minutes. Drain off  water. Add onions, bell peppers, cilantro, tomatoes, garlic powder, salt,  cumin, cloves, pepper, bay leaves and chile to meat and simmer. Remove  husks from tomatillos and boil in saucepan in 1 quart water until tender,  about 15 minutes. Drain off water. Mash tomatillos, add to meat mixture and  simmer, stirring constantly 15 minutes. Add lemon juice. Stir cornstarch  mixture then stir into meat mixture and simmer 15 minutes longer, stirring  constantly. Heat tortillas gently until softened (heat 1 at a time directly  on burner of range or wrap in foil and place in 350F oven a few minutes).  To make burritos, place heaping 1/2 cup meat mixture on each tortilla. Fold  sides in, then roll up from one end. Sprinkle burritos generously with  cheese and place under broiler just until cheese melts.    Created by: Jailhouse, Studio City    (C) 1992 The Los Angeles Times
