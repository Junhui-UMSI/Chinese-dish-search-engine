Freeze steak for 20 minutes or until firm.  With sharp knife, slice  across the grain into 1/4" thick diagonal slices.  Arrange slices in  shallow baking dish.  Combine remaining ingredients; pour over meat. Cover;  refrigerate several hours or overnight.     About 45 minutes before cooking, light the fire.  Place grill 4" above  the coals.  Drain meat, reserving marinade.  Gently lay strips across  grill.  Cook 3-4 minutes, turning once and basting with reserved marinade.     NOTE: If available, use hinged grilling rack, which will make it easier  to turn meat.
