Warm Mashed Potato and Swiss Chard Terrine
Eggs; beaten lightly, Stick (6 tablespoons), Swiss chard (about 1 pound);, Russet; (baking) potatoes, 
Remove coarse chard stems, reserving them for another use. In a saucepan  cook chard in water clinging to its leaves, covered, over moderately high  heat, stirring once or twice, until wilted and tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  Drain chard well in a colander and pat dry between paper towels. In a food  processor chop chard fine and season with salt and pepper.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a loaf pan, 9 by 5 by 3-inches, and  line bottom with buttered waxed paper.    Peel potatoes and quarter. In a kettle cover potatoes by 1 inch with salted  cold water and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain potatoes and  while still warm force through a ricer or medium disk of a food mill into a  bowl. With an electric mixer beat in butter, eggs, and salt and pepper to  taste until smooth.    Transfer half of potato mixture to another bowl and beat in chard until  smooth. Spread chard mixture in prepared pan and spread plain potato  mixture evenly over it. Terrine may be prepared up to this point 3 days  ahead and chilled, covered.    Put loaf pan in a baking pan and pour enough hot water into baking pan to  reach halfway up sides of loaf pan. Bake terrine in middle of oven 40  minutes, or until a thin knife inserted in center comes out clean, and let  stand in loaf pan on a rack 5 minutes. Run knife around edge of terrine and  invert onto a plate.    Serve terrine cut into slices.
