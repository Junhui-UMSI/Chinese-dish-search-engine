Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 12-cup bundt pan. In large  bowl of mixer, combine sugar, corn oil, eggs, vanilla and almond extracts.  Beat to blend.  Combine and sift flour, poppy seeds, baking powder and salt  into separate bowl.  Add dry ingredients alternately with milk into large  mixing bowl containing sugar mixture, beginning and ending with dry  ingredients.  Mix to blend.  Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake  approximately 45 to 50 minutes, or until toothpick inserted near center  comes out clean. Remove cake from oven and place pan on wire rack to cool  for 10 minutes.    Prepare glaze while cake is cooling:  Whisk powdered sugar, orange juice  and almond extract together in a small bowl to blend. Turn out cake onto  rack or cake platter. Spoon glaze over warm cake and allow cake to cool  completely before slicing.    From The Uptown Cafe in Butte, MT    Note:  This poppy seed cake, which works in low or high altitudes without  adjustment, will keep a number of days in a covered container on the  counter top and freezes well unglazed. Serve it plain for snacking, glazed  for desserts or with orange slices for breadfast.    Assorted recipes from the Detroit News, entered by Diane Pahl
