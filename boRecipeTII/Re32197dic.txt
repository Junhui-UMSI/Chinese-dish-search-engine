Barbecued Ribs, Smoked Butts and Other Great Feeds Version
Ground red pepper, Cider vinegar, Salt, Red pepper flakes, Brown Sugar, 
Today, I have two picnics just kicking along at about 8 seconds by the palm  test (225?) to make Eastern NC style pulled pork. They will be ready  sometime during tonights poker game. Trying something different on these.  Normally I only use a little salt and pepper on picnics, butts, and  shoulders or do them naked. Last night I rubbed one with my salt, molasses  and pepper cure and the other with Leggs Old Plantation sausage seasoning.  I dont use any baste or mop. When I pull and chop my pork, I mix in a thin  infusion sauce in the Eastern NC tradition while the meat is still hot. The  basic "sauce" (actually sauce is not the right term for something this  thin) is based on those from Dave Linebacks site:    Preparation: Combine all ingredients and let stand several hours before  using.    Since I am in the experiment mode, I added 1/2 pint water, 1 tsp celery  seed, and a dollop (maybe 1 Tbsp) molasses. In deference to former list  member and keeper of the recipes, Tom Solomon, I also added 1 tsp nuok mam  to half of this. The Nuok mam actually made a pleasant addition, rounding  out the flavors nicely.    I will keep enough in the refrigerator to last for about two weeks and  freeze the rest.
