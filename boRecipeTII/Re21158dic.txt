Two-Toned Grape Puff Pastry Tarts
Apricot jam, Seedless green grapes, cut, Seedless purple grapes, cut, Sugar, Cinnamon, Sheet (1/2 pound) frozen, 2-inch piece vanilla bean,, Vanilla ice cream, optional, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.    Into a small bowl, scrape seeds from vanilla bean with a knife and stir in  sugar and cinnamon.    On a lightly floured surface roll out pastry about 1/8-inch thick and cut  out 4 (6 by 5 1/2-inch) rectangles. Arrange pastry on baking sheet and fold  edges on all sides to form a 1/2-inch border, leaving corners unfolded.  Pinch corners and twist to make points. Press points down on baking sheet.  With a dinner fork, gently prick middle of rectangle several times. Arrange  grape halves in rows on pastry, alternating colors. Sprinkle each pastry  with sugar mixture.    Bake tarts in middle of oven until pastry is golden brown, 20 to 25  minutes. While tarts are baking, in a small saucepan heat jam over low  heat, stirring, until melted and strain through a sieve into a cup. On a  rack cool tarts for 5 minutes and then brush with jam.    Serve tarts warm with ice cream.    Yield: 4 servings    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8907 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #653 by  "Angele and Jon Freeman" <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Jun 30, 1997
