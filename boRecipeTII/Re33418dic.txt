Basics for new cooks:     Boiling Potatoes:    Scrub or peel potatoes; place in large pot. Cover with cold water, add salt  [about 1 tb for 16 cups of water.] and bay leaf. Bring to boil. Cover and  boil for about 20 minutes or until fork-tender. Drain, remove bay leaf and  return potatoes to pot over low heat for 30 seconds to evaporate excess  moisture.    Mashed Potatoes:    In pot, mash together potatoes, buttermilk, butter, salt and pepper until  smooth.
