This is a single, 1-1/2 pound bread-machine loaf that is fancier if baked  free-form.  Mostly, Ive baked it for family gatherings; not much at other  times. Its deliciously sweet, great for breakfast.  The instructions are  for a Hitachi B201.    *Note: Include the orange zest soaking water.  I also prefer potato water  ~- the water left over from boiling potatoes.    Youll need the zest (the orange part of the rind) from several oranges. A  zester can be used to cut off the zest.  Dry the little strings overnight  on a large plate.  Another method is to slice off the orange part of the  rind, trim off as much of the white stuff as possible, then julienne the  orange zest.    Soak the dried orange zest in 2 ounces hot water for several minutes until  soft.  Drain the water into a measuring cup and add potato water or tap  water.  Add the zest at the same time as the flour.  Pick over the raisins.    Crust:  Light Menu Selection: Mix Bread (this bakes the bread in the  machine,        allowing the raisins to be dropped in when it beeps), or Bread        plus Knead and First Rise cycle.    If baking a free-form loaf using the Knead and First Rise cycle, add the  raisins 4 to 8 minutes minutes before the rise starts (set a timer for 24  to 26 minutes).  Or knead them in before shaping the dough.    Divide the dough into two parts, 2/3 and 1/3 of the total.  Separate each  part into 3 pieces (total, 6 pieces). Roll the three larger pieces into 14  to 16-inch long "logs" and the three smaller pieces slightly shorter and  much skinnier.    Starting in the middle, braid the three parts together, first one end, then  the other.  Make two braids.  Pinch the ends of the braids and tuck under  slightly to make sure they dont open up while rising or baking.    Place the larger braid on a greased cookie sheet.  Then the smaller braid  on top of the larger.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise until  doubled.  After the rise, brush the top with egg yolk for a dark glaze, or  a whole egg for a slightly lighter one.  Mix the egg or yolk with a bit of  water and a shake of salt.    Bake for 40 minutes at 350 F.  Cover with foil after 15 minutes, even if  the crust looks light.    >From: bf138@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Bob Stedfeld)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
