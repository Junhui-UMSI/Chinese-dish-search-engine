Dissolve yeast in warm water; add oil and salt, then gradually stir in  flour. Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic. Let dough rest  about 10 minutes, then pat into a large baking sheet. (Crust should be on  the thin side, not deep-dish style.) Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oile in  skillet. Slice chicken breasts thin and cook along with onion, garlic and  cayenne until chicken is cooked through. Add mushrooms and basil and cook  another minute or two. Brush entire empty crust generously with olive oil.  (This is key not only to the taste but also to making the crust crispy.)  Sprinkle with shredded cheeses and add rest of toppings from the skillet.  Bake at 375 degrees until crust is golden (10-12 minutes)    NOTES : Topping amounts are approximate; adjust proportions of cheese,  chicken, and vegetables to suit you.
