Pink Scallops

This sounds like a decorators recipe, but it is not. There is a  beautiful pink-shelled scallop that lives in the waters of Puget Sound,  that inland body of salt water near which Seattle and Tacoma are situated.  The pink scallop has a bright taste that is not as sweet as that of the  eastern, or bay scallop . . . it is more like the wonderful brininess that  one associates with a good oyster or clam.      This special pink creature is sometimes called a "singing" or "scooter"  scallop because he lives on top of the sand under water, and snaps his  shell shut, thus forcing water out of the shell. The scallop can jet propel  himself about the sea bottom in this way.      I doubt you are going to be able to taste this bivalve unless you come to  Seattle. The scallops must be very fresh, and they do not take well to  travel, unless they do it on their own. If you do find some Pacific  Northwest pink scallops, cook them just as I do my Steamed Clams (see  recipe). The whole creature is edible and just delicious.
