Banana Bonanza Bread
Baking soda, Cinnamon to taste, Baking Powder, Sugar, All purpose flour, Very ripe bananas; (yes, 6,, Vanilla, 
In one bowl, mash the bananas until smooth (we like it a bit chunky) and  add the sugar and vanilla, blending until incorporated. In another bowl,  mix the dry ingredients until well blended and add to the bananas. Mix  these thoroughly. Pour this into a 9X13 glass baking dish (no need to  spray) or a regular loaf pan (spray a THIN coat of baking spray). Bake at  350 for an hour. Serve with a glass of COLD vanilla soy milk. If you dont  find this to turn out AMAZING let me know, but we doubt it will fail you!  Healthy eating!    Posted to fatfree digest by RubyTues59@aol.com on Nov 2, 1998, converted by  MM_Buster v2.0l.
