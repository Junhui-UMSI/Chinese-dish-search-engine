Peppers and Green Chili Meatloaf
Worcestershire Sauce, Egg, Garlic powder, Chili powder, Ground nutmeg, Garlic, Cornbread stuffing, Green pepper, Green chiles, Lean ground beef, Italian sausage, Ground pork, Onion, Tomato sauce, 
* Use prepared stuffing mix in box.    Combine the ground meat, pork, and sausage in large bowl. Mix in the  stuffing mix (which has been crushed slightly), onions, chiles, beaten egg,  chili powder, garlic and garlic powder. Pour in half the tomato sauce and  mix very well with your hands. (Wear plastic baggies on hands.) Slice the  green bell peppers into very thin slivers. Grease a cookie sheet with at  least 2-inch sides. Place the green peppers onto the sheet. Press the meat  mixture into a loaf dish and then turn out on top of the slivered green  peppers, tucking under any peppers slices that are not under the meat. Bake  in a preheated 375-degree oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Drain off any fat  from dish. An easy way is to absorb the fat with paper towels. Pour the  remaining tomato sauce, which has been blended with the nutmeg and  Worcestershire sauce, over the top of the meatloaf. Continue baking for  5-10 minutes longer. Let stand 15 minutes before slicing.    Recipe By     : Jo Anne Merrill    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
