Lasagna Roll-Ups
Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, Grated Parmesan cheese, Eggs, fresh parsley, Salt, Spaghetti sauce, Lasagna noodles, 
Preheat the oven to 375F. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the ricotta  cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, the Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, and  salt until well blended. Pour half of the spaghetti sauce over the bottom  of a 9" x 13" baking dish. Spoon the cheese mixture over the lasagna  noodles, distributing evenly, and roll up tightly. Place the roll-ups seam  side down on the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of the baking dish; top with  the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese and bake  for 35 to 40 minutes, or until heated through.    NOTE: For lighter roll-ups, use reduced-fat ricotta cheese, part-skim  mozzarella cheese, and even a reduced-fat spaghetti sauce.
