Apple and Raspberry Jelly
Sugar, Bottled apple juice, Sure-jell pectin, Butter or margarine, Red raspberry juice, 
Recipe by: Jo Merrill    Pour juices into a 6-8 quart kettle. Measure sugar into a separate bowl.  Add the Sure-Jell and butter to juices. Bring mixture to a full rolling  boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Quickly stir sugar into juices  and bring the mixture back to a full rolling boil--boil for 1 minute while  stirring constantly. Mixture will rise to within 2 inches of the top of the  pan so make sure you stir continuosly.    Remove from the heat and skim off foam with a spoon. Fill jars to 1/8th  inch from top. Wipe jar rims then cover with flat lids. Screw lids on  tightly.  Use a water bath to finish sealing.    Recipe  (from Bonnie Trigg of Oceanside) was a prize winner at the 1994  Del Mar, Ca county fair.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #148 by novmom@juno.com (Angela Gilliland)  on May 28, 1997
