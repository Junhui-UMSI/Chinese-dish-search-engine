"Made in Japan" Chicken Teriyaki
Chicken breasts, Mushrooms, Cabbage, vegetables, Terriyaki sauce, Salt and pepper, Bean sprouts, 
1. In wok or large skillet, with small amount of oil, cook vegetables until  done.    2. In smaller skillet (or same skillet after vegetables are cooked), heat  small amount of oil and quickly cook chicken shreds until done. Season with  salt and pepper to taste.    3. Serve both over plate of sticky rice drizzled with a good store-bought  terriyaki sauce.    NOTES : Other vegetables to add: carrots, broccoli, celery, bok choy. I  like the cabbage well-done, but the beansprouts added at the very last  minute so theyre hot, but still crunchy.
