Baked Stuffed Potatoes
Pepper, parmesan, Paprika, milk, Butter, Sour cream, Salt, green onion, Baking potatoes, 
Heres my grandmothers recipe for stuffed potatoes, which are decadent,  yet so satisfying!    Preheat oven to 425?. Wash potatoes and bake 45-60 minutes, until soft.  When done, and slightly cooled, cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out potato  and mix with all other ingresients, except cheese.    Lower oven to 375?. Fill each potato skin up with mixture. Sprinkle  parmesan and then paprika on top of each shell. Return to oven and bake for  15 minutes, untilk cheese melts and potatoes are slightly bubbly.    These can be made ahead of time: after filling skins, wrap individually in  clear wrap, and refrigerate or freeze. Let come to room temperature before  baking.
