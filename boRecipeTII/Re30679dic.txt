Tamales Pronto
Chicken broth, Masa harina, Canned green chili salsa, Foil, Pitted olives; chopped, Cooked corn, Onion, 
Cut 30 pieces of foil, each 6 inch square. Stir together masa flour and  chicken broth to make a thick paste. Place about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the  paste on each foil square and spread in center of foil in a 3 inch square.    Mix together corn, olives, onion, and salsa. Place about 1 1/2 table-spoons  of filling down center of each masa square. Fold foil edges together so  masa edges meet, then seal all sides.    Arrange tamales in a kettle with a rack placed on the bottom, so that the  tamales are not in the water. Add about 1 inch of water, cover, and steam  about 45 minutes. About 6 servings.
