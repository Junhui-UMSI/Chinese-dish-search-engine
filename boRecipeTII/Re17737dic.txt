Almond Tabbouleh
Quartered cherry tomatoes, Lightly packed chopped, Almond or other polyunsaturd, Vegetable oil, Chopped natural almonds, OR a 1/2 c raisins, Chopped fresh mint, Lime or lemon juice, Bulgur(cracked wheat), Green Onions, Pepper, Parsley, 
Spread almonds in a shallow pan. Toast in a moderate oven (350F) 10  minutes, or until lightly browned, stirring once or twice while toasting;  cool. Place bulgur in large bowl. Pour boiling water over to just cover.  Let stand until water is absorbed. Add cherry tomatoes or raisins, green  onions,parsley, mint, lime or lemon juice, oil and pepper. Toss until  mixed. Cover and chill. I thought this was a really nice twist, but then I  love almonds. Have a great day, great lady!!
