Unbaked Chocolate Cookies-Peanut Butter Variety
Sugar, Peanut butter, Margarine, Cocoa, milk, Vanilla, Waxed paper, Oatmeal, quick, 
Bring the first four ingredients to a full boil for one minute. Remove from  heat and add the other three ingredients. Drop them by Tablespoons on waxed  paper and chill. Dont be distressed if the first few teaspoons seem thin.  It will thicken *fast* as you continue to spoon out the cookies.    This recipe will double ok.    To double the recipe using chocolate, use 5.3 oz chocolate and 2 sticks of  margarine minus 5 1/3 Tablespoon.    Ive also heard these called No Bake Chocolate Cookies and Bakeless  Chocolate Cookies.
