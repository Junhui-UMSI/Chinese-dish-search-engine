Basic Salad Dressing
black pepper, Red wine vinegar, Water, Fresh lemon juice, vegetable oil, Sugar, Garlic powder, 
In  jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients.  Shake  well and refrigerate.  Makes 1/2 cup.  (Half of published recipe.) My  note: I frequently use bottled lemon juice which has sodium listed,  but there cant be much sodium in 1/2 tsp. divided among 8 servings.  If you use fresh lemon juice, extra can be frozen in an ice cube tray  or small container.    1 tbsp - 31 cal 3 grams total fat, 5 mg potassium    Source:  Am. Heart Assoc.
