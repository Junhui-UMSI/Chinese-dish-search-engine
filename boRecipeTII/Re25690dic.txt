Azuki Beans and Squash
Kombu, Dry azuki beans, Sea salt, Buttercup squash, 
Wash beans, cover with water and soak for 6 - 8 hours. Put kombu on bottom  of pot and cover with the squash. Next add soaked, drained beans. Add water  to just cover the squash layer. Do not cover the beans at the beginning.    Place the bean mixture over low heat and bring to a boil slowly. Cover  after about 10 - 15 minutes. Cook until beans are 70 - 80% done, about 1  hour or so. The water will evaporate as the beans expand, add more cold  water as required to keep level constant and make beans soft. When beans  are nearly done, add sea salt, cook another 15 - 30 minutes.    Transfer to serving bowl. Serve with brown rice.  Posted to fatfree digest by "Jan Gordon" <jan@gordon.com> on Jun 1, 1998
