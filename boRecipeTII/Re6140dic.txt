Pizza on the Grill - Pizza Dough
Kosher salt, All-Purpose Flour, White Cornmeal, Salt, Warm Water, olive oil, Whole-wheat flour, 
Dissolve yeast in the warm water with sugar.    After 5 minutes, stir in salt, cornmeal, whole-wheat flour, and oil.    Gradually add all-purpose flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until a stiff  dough has formed.    Place the dough on a floured board, and knead for several minutes, adding  only enough additional flour to keep dough from sticking.    When dough is smooth, transfer to a greased bowl.  To prevent, transfer to  a greased bowl. To prevent a skin from forming, brush top of dough with  additional olive oil, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in warm  place, away from drafts, until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hrs.    Punch down dough.  Knead dough several times on lightly floured board.  Return dough to bowl; cover and let rise 40 min.    Punch down dough.  If sticky, knead in a bit more flour.    Makes enough for four 12 inch pizzas.    Well, as usual...I dont follow directions.  I didnt do them on the grill  but in my oven.  I cooked them at 475 deg F for 15 min.  The dough was  probably the lightest and best that I have **ever** eaten.   I  topped one  with tomatoes, sweet anise, 1 T slivered almonds crushed, and sauteed  zucchini.  Topped another with the Mushrooms with Mint and Lemon recipe I  posted earlier in the week.  I gave half of the dough to Sally (my friend)  and she cooked them for dinner with her toppings.
