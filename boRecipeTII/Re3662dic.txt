1. Shell chestnuts. Place in cold water and bring to a boil. Boil 3  minutes; then drain.    2. Add milk and vanilla extract to chestnuts and heat (but do not boil).  Simmer, covered, until chestnuts are tender (20 to 30 minutes). Drain,  discarding milk.    3. Mash chestnuts together with butter, sugar and brandy. (The mixture  should have the consistency of mashed potatoes. If it doesnt, add some  heavy cream.)    4. Meanwhile heat the oven to 275 degrees. Beat egg white with cream of  tartar until stiff, but not dry.    5. Fold in salt, then sugar, then remaining vanilla extract. Transfer egg  mixture to a pastry tube.    6. Line a baking sheet with foil. Squeeze egg mixture out of tube in the  shape of a nest. Bake until golden (40 to 50 minutes). Remove from oven and  let cool slightly. Then transfer to a serving platter.    7. Meanwhile transfer the chestnut mixture to the pastry tube. Then squeeze  it out in thin threads over the baked egg nest to form a mound on top.    8. Whip heavy cream. Then sweeten it with powdered sugar.  Arrange as a  topping over chestnut mound. Garnish with maraschino cherries and serve.  VARIATION: For the brandy, substitute rum.
