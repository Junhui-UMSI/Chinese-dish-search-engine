Peppermint Cream Patties
Oil of peppermint, Sugar, Cream of tartar, Light corn syrup, milk, 
Combine all ingredients in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook over low heat,  stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved and the mixture comes to a  boil. Cover and cook for 3 minutes so that any sugar crystals on sides of  pan will be washed down by condensation. Uncover and cook to the soft-ball  ~ 238F - without stirring. Remove from heat and let stand for 3 minutes to  cool slightly. Flavor with about 10 drops of oil of peppermint, then beat  until creamy without scraping the side of pan. Drop candy by the teaspoon  onto foil to make patties. Allow to dry, then dip in Chocolate Coating.  Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator.
