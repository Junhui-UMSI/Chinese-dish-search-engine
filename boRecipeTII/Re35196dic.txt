Beef and Broccoli
Sesame oil, Oyster sauce, Brown sugar, Rice wine, Peanut oil, Broccoli, Water, ginger, Brown sugar, Boneless beef, Cornstarch, Salt, Cornstarch, Water, Rice wine, 
*(Flank steak, top sirloin, or tenderloin), sliced across grain into thin s  **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all seasoning  sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with marinade and marinate  for 30 minutes.  Heat wok over highest heat, when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp  peanut oil. Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds. Add broccoli and  stirfry one minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam  until crisp tender. Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water  is evaporated. Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without  rinsing) and, when hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and  stirfry until lightly browned but not cooked through. Do not stirfry too  vigorously or meat will not brown, it is better to press slices against  sides of wok to sear. Add broccoli to wok and toss. When hot, stir in  seasoning sauce and stir until sauce thickens (its a good idea to whisk  the sauce in the cup just before you hurl it into the wok). Turn onto a  platter and drizzle sesame oil over the top. The sugar in the marinade and  seasoning sauce acts as a floor enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope  you enjoy this recipe.
