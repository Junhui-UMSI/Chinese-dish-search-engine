Rinse  and retun to medium-low heat with enough stock to cover, plus about an  inch. Add remainder of ingredients except salt, and simmer until red beans  are soft, about 90 minutes. Salt to taste. The split peas and barley will  get mushy and make the soup thick.    fatfree digest V96 #218    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
