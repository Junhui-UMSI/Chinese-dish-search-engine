DOUGH: Cream butter and sugar, add eggs and flavoring. Mix well. Blend in  flour and baking powder. Work to form a soft pliable dough.    Cut off pieces of dough, the size of a walnut, roll to about 1/2"  thickness, then shape into a curved S shape about 2 1/2" long or a  straight 2 1/2" pencil shape.

ICING: Blend sugar and anise extract, adding milk slowly to form a soft,  smooth icing. Ice cookies while warm, sprinkle confetti on top if desired.
