Process the farmers cheese, finely chopped walnuts, and yogurt in a food  processor until smooth.    Transfer the cheese to a bowl and mix with herbs, garlic, and salt. Shape  into a ball, cover, and refrigerate for 4 hours.    Line a small serving platter with several lettuce leaves and carefully  transfer the cheese ball to the platter. Press the coarsely chopped walnuts  into the ball so they more or less cover it. Serve with the toasted pita  triangles.
