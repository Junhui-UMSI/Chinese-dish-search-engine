This is the Italian version of the waffle, and the Italian immigrants  brought their irons with them from the old country. They are rolled much  like the Krum Kaker and filled with flavored whipped cream or sweet  Ricotta-cheese (sweeten 1 cup Ricotta with 1/4 cup powdered sugar)  fillings. You can buy an electric iron from the Vitantonio Company. This is  their delicious recipe as well.      Beat the eggs and sugar together until light and smooth. Add the  margarine and vanilla. Sift in the flour and baking powder and mix until  smooth.      These are cooked on top of the stove in the same way as the Krum Kaker or  Gaufrette. They are usually served flat with powdered sugar on top.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
