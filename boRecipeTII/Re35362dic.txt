Fold one end of the tortilla up about 1 inch over filling; fold right and  left sides over folded end, overlapping. Fold down remaining end, and  serve. REFRIED BEANS: Heat lard in 10-inch skillet over medium heat until  hot. Add pinto beans; cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mash  beans; stir in remaining ingredients. Add oil to skillet if necessary; cook  and stir until smooth paste forms, about 5 minutes. Garnish with shredded  cheese, if desired.
