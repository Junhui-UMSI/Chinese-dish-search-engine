submitted by: sgjg6566@pipeline.com (Julie, Michigan, USA)  Hi everybody!  Spring here in Michigan is very strange, semi-warm days and  cold nights.  I had a yearning for some chowder and here is one of my  familys favorite recipes    Cook the bacon until crisp in Dutch oven or heavy saucepan.  Remove bacon  with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels and set aside.  Add onion to the  drippings and saute til soft.  Add beef; cook til browned.  Stir in  tomatoes, beef bouillon, water, salt, pepper, chili powder and kidney  beans.  Simmer about 20 minutes; stirring occasionally. Put 1/2 cup rice  into a bowl and pour chowder on top, sprinkle with reserved crumbled bacon.
