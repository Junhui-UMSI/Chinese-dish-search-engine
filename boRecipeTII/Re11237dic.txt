Skim milk soured (1 T.lemon, Chopped nuts (optional), Vanilla, Flour, Babyfood), Quick Oats, Brown sugar, Mashed bananas, Juice, add milk to 1/2c.), Salt (I omit), Baking soda, Chocolate or carob chipa, Sugar, Prune puree (or prune, Raisins, Egg replacer + 1/2c. water, 
Cream bananas, prune mixture, and sugars.  Add egg replacer/water and beat  thoroughly.  Add in vanilla, salt, baking soda, flour, and oats, beating at  medium speed after eaach addition.  Stir in other ingredients. Spray baking  sheets lightly.  Drop heaped soup spoonfuls onto sheets. Bake at 400  degrees F. for 15-25 min. (depends on altitude) until slightly brown and  slightly crisp on the outside.    NOTE:  Ive been making these at 7200 feet altitude.  I cut the baking soda  to 1 1/2 tsp.  You may want to cut the liquids some at lower altitude.    Adding the soured milk.  I usually beat it in with the egg replacer/water.    I cut the sugar, replaced half the bananas with prune puree, and added  soured milk to make a softer cooky.  This makes a very large amount. Use  your largest bowl for mixing them.  I usually bake some and refrigerate the  remainder of the dough until the next week.    Posted by BETTE IDE <IDE@uwyo.edu> to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 15 Issue  20] Feb. 20, 1995.
