Wash and drain pinto beans and soak in water to cover overnight. Bring  beans to a boil in same water; lower heat and simmer 2 to3 hrs or till  tender. Drain.    Meanwhile, melt butter in large skillet. Add onions, shallots, garlic,  seeded and chopped green chilis. Saute until onion is soft. Add chopped  serloin and cook over medium heat until meat is brown.    In a separate pan, brown sausage and pour off fat. Add sausage to onion and  meat mixture. Sprinkle flour over meats and stir to blend. Transfer meat  mixture to a heavy Dutch oven or 8 quart kettle.    Add cooked and canned beans, pimiento, tomatos, celery, mushrooms, green  and red peppers, olives, parsley, and chili sauce. Bring to a boil; lower  heat simmer about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Stir in salt, garlic salt, pepper, cilantro, oregano, and chili powder (add  one Tbsp at a time, taste for seasoning preference). Continue simmering  about 1 1/4hours, stiring every 15 minutes. Skim off fat with a cold spoon  as it rises to the top.    Just before serving, remove from heat; stir in sour cream and return to a  very low heat just long enough to heat through. Can be made ahead and  frozen. Add sour cream just before serving.    NOTES : You will need a LARGE pot to make this in.    Recipe by: Diane Browder (Sierra Mountain Quilters Ass.)
