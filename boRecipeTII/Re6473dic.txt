Make the Plunderteig and chill it.   Roll 1/3 of the dough out 1/2"  thick.  Cut it into 3" triangles and brush each triangle with beaten egg.  Place a tablespoon or so of the almond paste, shaped in a small roll, on  the base of each triangle.  Cover each triangle with 1 tablespoon of the  candied fruit and sprinkle them with a little cinnamon sugar. Roll up the  triangles and shape them gently into crescents. Brush them with beaten egg  and let them rise, covered, on a buttered baking sheet in a warm place  until they double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Bake in a 350 degree F. oven  (moderate) for 20 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden brown.   Brush them immediatelyh with apricot preserves.    Mandelfulle:  Grind the almonds and stir in the sugar. Add the egg and  beat until the paste is very smooth.    Source: Gourmets Old Vienna Cookbook
