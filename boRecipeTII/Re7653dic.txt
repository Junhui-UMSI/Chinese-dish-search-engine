Vegetable cooking spray, Fresh thyme, Low sodium chicken broth, Cornstarch, Water, Orzo Pasta Stuffing, Fresh rosemary, Black Pepper, Pork tenderloin; lean, 
Prepare orzo stuffing. Set aside.    Make a horizontal slice in the pork tenderloin to create a pocket. Open  tenderloin like a book.  Place between 2 sheets of wax paper. Flatten with  mallet until meat is of equal thickness. Place orzo stuffing lengthwise  along center of tenderloin. Roll the meat up lengthwise, leaving the seam  on the bottom. Tie meat with butchers string so it remains closed. Do not  tie too tightly.    Roll the tenderloin in chopped herbs. Season with pepper. Sear meat in a  nonstick skillet until slightly brown. Transfer meat to roasting pan which  has been sprayed lightly with vegetable oil. Roast in a preheated  350-degree oven until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees, about 30  minutes. Remove meat from pan. Let rest.    Deglaze pan drippings with chicken broth. Strain liquid into small  saucepan. Add dissolved cornstarch. Stir until slightly thickened.    Untie string on tenderloin. Slice meat into 8 slices, provide 2 slices per  serving. Serve with pan juices.    This recipe is by Wayne King, a high school senior from NY.
