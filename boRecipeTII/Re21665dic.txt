Apple Stack Cake
Molasses, Buttermilk, Cinnamon, Crisco, Self-Rising Flour, Ginger, Sugar, Eggs, Baking soda, Sugar, Apple Pie Spice, Apples, 
This recipe is my Mammaws as described by my cousin Ethel Tackett to the  Alleghany Freewill Baptist Auxiliary in Alleghany, Kentucky. It is a little  different than I originally remembered but as I read the recipe the flavors  all came back to me. Hope you enjoy!    Cream together sugar, molasses and Crisco. Add Eggs and mix well. Add  bittermilk and mix. Add soda and ginger to flour; by hand, blend flour into  creamed mixture. Pour 1/2 cup of mixture into greased pans. Bake at 400  until until done. Makes 6 - 8 layers, if using 8-inch pans. Cook apples,  sugar and spices together. Stack cake together using apples between each  layer.    NOTE: I remember Mammaw using dried apples rather than fresh. Obviously my  cousin has updated this a touch.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "June A. Halapir" <ad6097@WAYNE.EDU> on Feb 9,  1998
