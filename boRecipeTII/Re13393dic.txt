Yankee Potato Salad with Dill
Mayonnaise, Red potatoes, Steamed Broccoli Florets, In, Coarse Mustard, Fresh Dill, White vinegar, Fresh Ground Black Pepper,, Salt, 
Place potatoes in a heavy sauce pan and add enough water to cover them  three-fourths of the way. Boil until tender but still firm, about 20  minutes. Drain. Place mayonnaise in a large heat-proof bowl. Whisk in  vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper, then slice or chunk in the potatoes  while they are still hot. Stir frequently while cooling. When salad is  cool, add the dill. Refrigerate until chilled and toss with the broccoli  right before serving.    NOTES : Lots of fresh dill, mustard, vinegar and mayonnaise. The secret is  to mix everything while the potatoes are hot. And to add a handful of  lightly steamed broccoli florets from the garden right before serving. This  tastes even better the second day.
