From: Better Homes and Gardens Low Calorie Recipes, Spring 1985    Notes: I thought this was very good.    In a saucepan cook unpeeled potatoes, onion, and celery in boiling lightly  salted water for 10 - 15 minutes or till potatoes are just tender; drain.    (note, I prefer not to cook the celery and onion)    In a saucepan combine the 1.3 cup water and cornstarch. Stir in vinegar,  sugar, salt, celery seed, and pepper. Cook and stir till thickened and  bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes more. Stir in bacon and vegetables Cook 3 -  5 minutes more or till potatoes are heated through, tossing lightly to coat  potatoes with dressing. Serves 4.
