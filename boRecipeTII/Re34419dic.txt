Bean Casserole
Grated cheese (cheddar or, salt and pepper, (small) tomatoes (diced), Kidney beans, Oregano, Basil, Garlic powder, Lentils, 
Drain liquid off the lentils, and mix with kidney beans (not drained) in a  casserole dish. Drain about 2/3 the juice from the tomatoes, and add to the  beans.  It is important to do this, because it gets too "soupy" if there is  too much liquid.  Add cheese and seasoning.  Bake in 350 degree F oven for  30 to 45 minutes. (till heated through)     NOTE:  you can alter the seasoning to whatever you want.  Try curry or  Mexican seasoning for a variation.
