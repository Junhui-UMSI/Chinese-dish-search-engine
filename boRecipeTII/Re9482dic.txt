PUDDING: Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add milk and beat again. Stir in  pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla. Add bread pieces and  press with your hands to submerge bread in the milk mixture. (If you have  the time, cover and refrigerate the mixture several hours or overnight;  break up the bread the next day and bake as directed; if not, proceed as  follows.) Set the mixture aside for 15 minutes. Use your fingers to break  up the chunks of bread. Set aside 15 minutes and repeat. Add raisins. Heat  oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter a 2 quart baking dish. Fill the dish  with bread pudding mixture and bake for 1 hour, or until pudding is set.  Serve warm, hot or cold with hot bourbon sauce. BOUBON SAUCE: Use unsalted  real butter for the best bourbon sauce; margerine doesnt make a great  sauce. Melt butter in a bowl set over hot but not boiling water. Combine  egg, sugar and milk in a small bowl and beat until light colored. Add to  butter and beat with a whisk over hot water until sugar dissolves - at  least 5 minutes. Add boubon and stir. Remove from stove and serve.
