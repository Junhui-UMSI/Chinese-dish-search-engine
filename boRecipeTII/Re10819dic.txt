Quince Syrup (Sharbat-E Beh Limou)
Quinces; about 2 lbs, Lime juice, Sugar, Water, 
From _Food of Life_.     Quarter quinces and remove cores.  Do not peel.  Wash and pat dry. Process  in juicer.(Note: There is a variation below that doesnt require a juicer.)  Bring sugar and water to boil.  Add quince juice and lime juice.  Boil 30  minutes over medium heat until syrup thickens.     Variation:  Tie quince in cheesecloth and cook in 2 cups water over medium  heat for 30-40 minutes.  Add 2 cups water and 2 cups sugar, and cook over  medium heat for 30 minutes.(Note: Only half the amount of sugar is used  here. I would taste it to see if you need more.) Squeeze and remove  cheesecloth and add lime juice.     Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Pour syrup in clean dry bottle and  cork.(I store my other drink syrups in the refrigerator.)     Mix well 1 part syrup with 3 parts water.  Serve chilled over ice.    SEHENDER@REED.EDU    (SARAH HENDERSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
