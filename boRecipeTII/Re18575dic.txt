This dish is known as a slow cook and is prepared over wood fires in the  villages.  Keeping the pan covered and simmering slowly ensures that the  flavors are sealed in. It is a typical method of village cooking.    Marinade: 1. Mix the marinade ingredients together; pour over been, and  marinate for 15 minutes.    2.  Put the beef and marinade in a pan, add the water and lemongrass, and  stir to mix.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat for about 1  1/2 hours. Do not uncover the pan until beef is almost tender. Shake the  pan once or twice during this time.    3.  When the beef is tender, add the tamarind liquid; adjust the salt if  necessary.  Cook the beef for 5 minutes more.    Serve warm with rice and other dishes.    From:  THE BURMESE KITCHEN by Copeland Marks and Aung Thein, Evans and  Company, Inc., New York.  1987.
