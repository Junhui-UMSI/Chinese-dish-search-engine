Shape into balls and then flatten into patties.  If the caul fat is used, cut the sheets into 8 6-in. squares and wrap each  patty neatly in a square of fat. 3. Heat the oil in a skillet and add the  patties. Cook over relatively high heat until browned on one side, about 2  min. Turn and cook until nicely browned on the other side. Reduce the heat  and continue cooking about 12-15 min. 4. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.    This dish: Crepinettes de porc
