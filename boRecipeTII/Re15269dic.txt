White Almond Bark Fantasy Fudge
Sour cream, walnuts, apricots, marshmallow creme, Margarine, Sugar, Almond bark, 
Combine sugar, sour cream and margarine in heavy 2 1/2 to 3 quart saucepan,  bring to full rolling boil, stirring constantly.  Continue boiling 7  minutes over medium heat or until candy thermometer reaches 234. Stir  constantly to prevent scorching.  Remove from heat, stir in remaining  ingredients, beat until well blended.  Pour in greased 9x13 inch pan. Cool  at room temperature, cut in squares. Note: I didnt chop the almond bark I  put it in the microwave for about 5 minutes to slightly melt it.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #309 by Ethel Snyder <essie@abelink.com> on  Nov 28, 1997
