Fruit Leather
Free form recipe, 
To make fruit leather: Select ripe or slightly overripe produce  (combinations also if desired). Wash, remove any blemishes, stems or pits  and peal produce if desired. (Skins are highly nutritious.) Puree the  produce in a blender until it is smooth.    Pour 1 1/2  to 2 cups of puree on to the parchment paper or plastic wrap  covered trays of dehydrator.  Since the edges tend to dry more rapidly, the  poured puree should be 1/8" thick at the center and 1/4" thick at the  edges.  Place in the dehydrator with temperature set at 135. Average drying  time for leathers is 4 to 6 hours.  When the leather has dried, it will be  a bit shiny and non-sticky to the touch. Allow the leather to cool and peel  it from the tray.  Roll it into a tight cylindrical shape. A piece of  plastic wrap, measured to fit the length and width, is then tightly wrapped  around the leather.
