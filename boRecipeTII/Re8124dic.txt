Potato Cheese Gratin
Lg. cloves garlic *, Lg.  potatoes **, Grated gruyere cheese, Whipping cream, Salt and pepper to taste, 
* Garlic cloves should be peeled and split.     ** Potatoes should be peeled and sliced paper-thin. (Slice at the last  minute so that they do not darken; do not soak in cold water).     Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Rub the bottom and sides of a gratin  dish with the cut sides of the garlic. Leave the garlic in the dish. Cover  with a layer of potatoes. Sprinkle with some salt and freshly ground pepper  and cheese. Pour some cream over the whole thing. Repeat until all the  potatoes, cream, and cheese are used. Place the pan, uncovered in the oven.  (Put a baking sheet underneath to catch spills.) Bake for 1 hour or more,  until the top is browned and the cream has cooked down to a thick sauce.  During the first 1/2 hour of cooking, use a broad spatula to push the top  layers of potatoes into the cream every once in a while. Serve hot, at room  temerature or cold. * I use evaporated Skim milk instead of cream, also  have used several different kinds of cheese.
