You should add the egg white, beaten to firm peaks, last.  Finally add the  flavorings, vanilla extract and/or nutmeg.  Dont use much nutmeg it is  quite stong in the custard. Also dont beat it too much or you will kill  the egg white.    When it is all incorporated, pour it into a baking pan (for individual  servings use individual custard cups)  Place the pan in a pan of warm water  and bake at 300-325 degs for about an hour.    Testing custard is abit tricky.  after about an hour slip a knife between  the edge of the custard and the pan.  It should be clean.  The center  should still be soft. It will continue to cook for a bit after you take it  out. If you suspect that the center is done too much put the pan in a pan  of cold/ice water to stop the cooking process. You can use the knife test  to see if it is too doine in the middle.
