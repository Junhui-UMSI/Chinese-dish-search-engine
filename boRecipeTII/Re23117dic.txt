Put slices on  tray and bake in 400-degree oven until lightly toasted. Turn slices over  and brush with remaining garlic butter. Return to oven until toast is  evenly browned. Remove from oven and top each slice with approximately 2  Tbsp. tomato mixture. Serve immediately so bread does not become soggy.
