Soak the Porcini in 2 cups of hot water until softened, about 30 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Rinse and chop the mushrooms,  discarding any tough bits. Strain the liquid through    a sieve lined with cheesecloth and reserve.    Meanwhile, in a large nonreactive casserole, heat the oil over moderately  high heat. Add the onion and Pancetta saute until golden, about 6 minutes.  Season lightly with salt and pepper. Increase the    heat to high, add the venison and cook until all the meat juices have  evaporated, about 15 minutes.    Add the chopped Porcini to the casserole, along with the wine, bay leaves,  cloves and rosemary. Cook, stirring for 5 minutes, until the wine is nearly  evaporated.  Stir in the tomato paste and season lightly with salt and pepper. Add the  stock and the reserved mushroom liquid and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat  to moderately low and simmer, partially covered,    until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the bay leaves and  rosemary sprig. (The venison stew can be made up to 2 days ahead and  refrigerated, covered.)

Using a slotted spoon, transfer the gnocchi to a warm platter and  cov    er with foil. Toss the gnocchi with the hot venison sauce and serve  immediately.
