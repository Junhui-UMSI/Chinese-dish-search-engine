Zucchini and Onions-Quick And Easy
Onion; cut in 1" chunks, Butter; optional, Cloves garlic; mashed (opt), Salt and pepper, Zucchini; * see note, 
*Washed, cut into 1/2" slices if small; split sideways and cut in 1/2"  pieces if medium. If large squash is used, test skin to see if it needs to  be peeled (sometimes larger squash have tough skins), and remove the center  if there are large, tough seeds present. Then cut into 1/2" x 1" pieces.    Place cut up zucchini and onions (and garlic, if desired) in large,  microwave-safe bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for  9-10 minutes, then let rest for about 15.    Drain liquid from cooked zucchini, and season with butter (or butter  substitute) if desired, and salt and pepper.    Ive cooked a lot of zucchini a lot of different ways, but we come back to  this one a lot. Its very fast...with small zucchini and a sharp chefs  knife, you can have it in the microwave in about 2 minutes. Very convenient  when barbecuing, you can start it and go grill your dinner, then drain and  season the zucchini just before serving. Also, since you dont have to add  water when microwaving it, I think you retain the flavor of the zucchini  better.
