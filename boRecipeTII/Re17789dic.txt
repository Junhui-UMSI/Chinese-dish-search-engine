Almondnog
Vanilla extract, Bananas (not over-ripe), Almond milk, more if desired, Ground nutmeg, 
Blend the above until smooth, then sprinkle a little nutmeg on top. Serve  immediately as banana changes flavour when it sits after blending, so dont  try to keep in the refrigerator.    This comes from Maryln Diamonds book. posted by Ted Wayn Altar in  REC.FOOD.VEG
