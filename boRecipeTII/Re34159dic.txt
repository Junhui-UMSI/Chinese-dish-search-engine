Bavarian Cream
unflavored gelatin, Cold water, Egg yolks, Sugar, Salt, milk, Vanilla, Heavy cream, 
Sprinkle gelatin on cold water. Beat egg yolks, sugar & salt in the top of  a double boiler. Beat until light. Add milk. Cook over boiling water,  stirring constantly, until mixture is thick & smooth. Add softened gelatin,  dissolve. Add vanilla. Cool until thick, stirring often. Whip cream until  it is very thick, but not stiff, fold into the cooled gelatin mixture. Pour  into a 6-cup mold rinsed in cold water, chill until set. Unmold, serve with  chocolate sauce. Makes 6 servings.    My Notes: I added an extra egg yolk, & about half a pint of red raspberries  to the milk mixture to make sure it would thicken. I didnt have heavy  cream, so I used a cup of lite sour cream.    From: A & P Cookbook & Shopping Guide Shared By: Pat Stockett
