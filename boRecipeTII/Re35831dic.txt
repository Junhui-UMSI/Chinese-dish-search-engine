Stuffed Flounder
White bread, Eggs, Salt to taste, bell pepper, Onion, Flounder, Juice of one lemon, pepper, Unsalted butter, Amontillado sherry, center-slice boned ?, Chopped parsley, Celery, Crab meat, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. Lay the fish bottom side (the white side)  up on a cutting board and make an incision in each fish down to the  backbone along the center of the fish, stopping just shy of the head  and tail. Working at an oblique angle, slip the knife in between the  flesh and backbone and run the knife down the ribs on both sides of  the backbone.    Saute the onion, celery and bell pepper in a heavy saute pan in about  half of the butter over medium-high heat until the onions begin to  become transparent, about 5 minutes. Toss with the crabmeat, bread,  eggs, parsley, ham, and sherry, seasoning to taste with salt and  pepper. Remember that the country ham is salty and will impart its  flavor to the crabmeat. Stuff the fish with the mixture, brush a  glass baking pan with some of the remaining butter, and add the fish  to the pan. Mix the rest of the butter with the lemon juice, pour  over the fish, and bake for 30-45 minutes or until the fish flakes  easily with a fork.
