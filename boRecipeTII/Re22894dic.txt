Starter: To make the starter called Biga pour the warmed water into a glass  bowl, pre-warmed by rinsing in hot water. Add a pinch of sugar & the yeast,  stir briefly, & let mixture stand for 10 minutes or so in a warm spot,  until it looks creamy & bubbly. Then mix in the flour & the other water.  This concoction should then be allowed to ferment, covered with plastic  wrap, anywhere from 6 - 24 hours or more, depending on the temperature. The  longer it ferments the stronger the flavor it imparts to the bread. If the  mix separates noticeably & a clear liquid settles to the bottom, its  reaching the outer limits of use. If the starter begins to turn pink TOSS  IT OUT!! Bread: Pour all wet ingredients into bread machine baking pan.  Measure all other ingredients except yeast into baking pan. Sprinkle yeast  over dry ingredients, being careful not to get yeast wet. Use regular bake  cycle on your machine for this loaf.    Recipe by: More Recipes for Your Bread Machine Bakery by R. W.
