1. Place the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion, basil, oregano, and  marjoram and cook, covered, over medium heat until the onion is golden. Add  the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Remove the onion and garlic and  reserve. 2. Place the tomato paste in the same saucepan and cook over  medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.    3. Add the canned tomatoes and mash wiht a fork or potato masher. If you  prefer a creamier sauce, blend the tomatoes in a blender until smooth. Add  the water and bring to a fast boil.    4. Reduce the heat. Add the reserved onion, garlic, salt and pepper.  Simmer, covered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.    Note: for a thick sauce (if sauce is to be used for pizza), cook,  uncovered, during the last half hour, stirring often to prevent burning.
