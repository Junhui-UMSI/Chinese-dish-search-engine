Bakaliaro Tiganito (Fried Salt-Cod)
Baking Powder, Dried salt cod, All-purpose flour, Vegetable oil for frying, Cold water, Salt, 
Cut the cod into 4-inch sections.  Place in a glass or earthenware bowl,  cover with cold water, and soak overnight.  The next day, drain and discard  the water.  Put the cod in a pot and cover with cold water.  Bring to a  boil, then remove from the heat and lift out the cod with a slotted spoon.  Remove the bones and the black skin.    In a medium bowl, combine the flour, water, salt, and baking powder to make  a thin batter.  Dip the cod in batter and fry in hot oil (about 1/2 inch  deep) on both sides, then lower heat and cook until tender, turning once  again.  Serve hot, with skordalia, which is cold or room temperature.    Note: If the cod is excessively salty, change water 2 or 3 times during the  soaking period.
