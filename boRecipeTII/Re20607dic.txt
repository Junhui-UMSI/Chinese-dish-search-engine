SERVES 6-8      We know that the apple seeds brought from England were intended for this  very dish. Apple cobbler goes back to the time of the Pilgrims, and since  it is so easy to make you should offer this bit of edible history to your  family very soon.      Heat a frying pan and add the 3 tablespoons butter. Put the apples and  raisins in the pan and saute for a few minutes over medium heat until they  are tender. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar, and the spices. Stir and set aside.      Pour the melted butter into a 7x11x2-inch baking dish. Mix the remaining  cup of sugar with the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well and then  stir in the milk. Spread this batter on top of the butter.      Pour the apple mixture over the batter and bake in a 350? oven for about  50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.      Serve this warm, topped with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
