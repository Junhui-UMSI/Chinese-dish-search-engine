Recipe by: Creepy Cuisine, Lucy Munroe       Wash the tomatoes and cut them in half crosswise. Place the halves -  open side up - on a cookie sheet. In a small bowl, mash together the  avocado (sludge), grated Swiss cheese (pus), and basil (poisonous plant  matter).  Spoon the mixture on top of the tomatoes and sprinkle with  oregano (fly wings). Broil the tomatoes for 5 minutes, or until pus begins  to ooze.  Carefully remove the tomatoes from the broiler and serve hot, or  allow to cool slightly and eat them with your hands (wearing plastic  gloves, of course - to keep from being contaminated)!
