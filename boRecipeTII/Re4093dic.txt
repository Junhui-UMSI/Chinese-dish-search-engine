Pepperoni Pasta
Pepperoni, Seasoning, Green pepper, crushed tomatoes, Mushrooms, Onion, Garlic, 
Saute onion, green pepper, and garlic in olive oil.  (You may saute in  water if you are watching fat content). Add pepperoni, tomatoes, mushrooms,  and seasoning. Cook on simmer until flavors blend - 15 to 30 minutes. Serve  over hot pasta, with grated parmesean or romano on top.    (I ALWAYS zap my pepperoni in the microwave to get rid of some of the fat.  Just lay it out on paper towels,  zap for 40 seconds, pat the paper towels  to pull out fat. I do this when I am making pizza too - really helps cut  back on the grease that accumulates on pizza).
