Cook over  moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the  mixture forms a dry mass, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool, then  grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder; set aside.    In a large heavy saucepan, combine the milk, creme fraiche, vanilla bean  and remaining 1 1/4 cups sugar and 1/2 teaspoon lavender. Cook over  moderate heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves and the  mixture is hot, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and let steep  for 15 minutes. Strain the milk through a fine-mesh sieve and return to the  saucepan.    In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until blended.  Gradually whisk in  one-third of the warmed milk mixture in a thin stream, then whisk the  mixture back into the remaining milk in the saucepan. Stir in the reserved  lavender powder.    Cook over moderately low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard  lightly coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 7 minutes.  Do not let boil.    Immediately remove from the heat and strain the custard into a medium bowl.  Set the bowl in a large bowl of ice and water and let cool to room  temperature, stirring occasionally.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, at  least 2 hours or overnight.    Pour the custard into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the  manufacturers instructions.
