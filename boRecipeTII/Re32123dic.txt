Barbecued Indian Spice Turkey
Turkey breast, boned and, Minced seeded jalapeno chili, Cayenne pepper, Garlic powder, Plain nonfat yogurt, Nutmeg, Ground cumin, 
Trim halved turkey breast slices of all fat and skin. Butterfly meat by  using a sharp knife, starting in center of one long side and cutting in  half to within 1/2" of second long side; open meat like a book (using  partially frozen turkey makes this process easier). Set meat flat on a  platter.    Mix together yogurt, chili, cumin, pepper, nutmeg, and garlic powder in a  small bowl.  Rub mixture over turkey, cover, and chill overnight (or at  least 2 hours).    Prepare barbecue.  Grill meat 4 inches from heat source until cooked  through, about 4-6 minutes per side. Let stand for 5 minutes, then cut  diagonally into slices. Serve with a rice salad. Makes about 6 servings.
