Cream of Potato Soup
Butter, Potatoes, Water, butter, Flour, Milk, Salt and pepper, Parsley, Chives, Onions, 
Wilt onions in butter. Add potatoes and enough water to cover. Cook until  tender (test after 20 min). Drain well, saving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.  Puree the vegetables.    Melt butter and stir flour into it. Cook over low heat until light blond in  color. Add potato water and milk. Season to taste. Bring to a boil and add  vegetable puree. Heat over medium heat, "beating with an egg beater for  several minutes." Sprinkle herbs over and serve at once.    This recipe, if made the day before with a little cream, can be served cold  as "Vichysoisse."    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 28, 98,
