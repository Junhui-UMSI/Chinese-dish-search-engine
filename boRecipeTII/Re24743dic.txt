Aunt Annas Listy
Whiskey, Yolks, A dash of salt, Whole egg, All-purpose flour, Lard for frying, 
Source: Roberta Brisson - This recipe is from my dads sister. Its also a  very old recipe.    Mix eggs, salt, flour and whiskey to make a stiff dough working it into a  smooth dough. On a lightly floured board, roll dough very thin (almost  paper thin). Cut into the size of a 3-inch square and make 2 slits in the  center with a sharpe knife. This is a very stiff and sticky dough.    Deep fry in lard (350 degrees) for 2 to 3 seconds. Fry only a couple at a  time. Remove from fat and drain on paper toweling. Dust generously with  confectioners sugar when cooled.    NOTE: This is the only recipe I dont substitute the lard. It gives the  pastry a better taste that oil. My father also said that these were like  eating air. (Too bad that they dont have the calories of air.) It was one  of his favorites.
