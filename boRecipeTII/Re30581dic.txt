Tagliatelli Con Fungi Im Harissa
Veggie stock, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Charissa, Semolina wheat, fresh mushrooms, Grated Parmesan, Garlic, fresh parsley, Butter, 
Recipe By : David de Graaf    Clean and wipe all mushrooms carefully. Cut into strips approximately the  width of the tagliatelli or linguini if you cant find tagliatelli. Start  the stock boiling in a wide pan for the pasta. Cook the pasta as per  instructions al dente. In the mean time, start to melt the butter in a  heavy frying pan. Combine with olive oil as soon as the butter starts to  brown slightly. This allows for a higher temerature for frying without the  butter burning. Add the mushrooms together with the charissah and saute  over high heat until the mushrooms barely start to sweat (about 5-8  minutes). Add the garlic for another minute, throw in the chopped parsley  or basil (keep some for granish) and take off heat. Poor water off pasta  and immedialtey mix with the mushrooms. Stir in 1/4 cup of the cheese and  keep the rest for serving next to the pasta. Enjoy! Posted to JEWISH-FOOD  digest V97 #234 by David de Graaf <degraaf@iname.com> on Aug 19, 1997
