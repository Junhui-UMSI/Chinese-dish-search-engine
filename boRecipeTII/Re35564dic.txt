Here is a real yummy coffee cake recipe that I got from Bon Appetit Nov.  1990. Its one of our favorites!    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 9 x 5 x 3 - inch loaf pans. Combine  first 3 ingredients in a small bowl. Cut in 1/4 c. chilled butter using  fingers or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Set streusel  mixture aside.    Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and nutmeg into large bowl. Using  electric mixer, cream 3/4 c. butter and 1 1/3 c. sugar together in another  large bowl until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each  addition. Mix in vanilla. Fold in dry ingredients alternately with plain  yogurt, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.    Pour about 1 1/2 c. batter into bottom of each prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/3  c. streusel over each. Sprinkle 1/4 of apple over each. Divide remaining  batter, streusel and apple between pans, beginning with batter. Run small  sharp knife through batter to create swirl. Bake until golden brown and  toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool on  rack. Serve warm or at room temp.
