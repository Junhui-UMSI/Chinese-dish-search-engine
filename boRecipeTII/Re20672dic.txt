From: dmcmenam@mtholyoke.edu (Dianna McMenamin)    Date: 29 Nov 1993 17:06:24 GMT  I think every apple crisp recipe Ive ever seen uses oatmeal, although my  eleven-year-old made the following recipe and substitued rye meal, and it  tasted just fine.    The recipe is from "Dollar a Day Cookbook" by Ruth and Bill Kaysing (1977,  Chronicle Books, San Fransisco). (I also recommend the more complicated  recipe found in the Moosewood Cookbook.) If you want to simplify this  recipe further, omit the wheat germ, bran, and rice flour. Instead just add  more oats, and substitute in some wheat flour.    Wash, core and slice 8 large apples. Mix the honey, lemon juice, and  cinnamon, and add them to the apples. Toss to mix and coat. Place the  mixture in a buttered baking dish and add a topping made of the remaining  ingredients, mixed well and sprinkled over the apples to cover.    Bake in a preheated oven at about 325 degrees for 35 to 45 minutes, or  until the apples are tender. Remove and see how much cooling time you can  allow before its totally devoured by apple bandits. Serves 6 normal  people, or 2 apple bandits!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
