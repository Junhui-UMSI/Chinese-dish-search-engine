Poached Pears with Star Anise, Ginger and Lemongrass
Hard Anjou pears, Sprigs mint, Whole star anise, Sugar, Piece ginger, 2" long,, Lemon juice, Dry Sauvignon Blanc, Piece lemon grass, 6" long,, 
In a medium saucepan simmer the spices, sugar, and wine for 15 minutes.    Meanwhile halve, peel and core the pears. Add the pear halves to the  infused wine and poach about 20 minutes or until just soft enough to be  easily penetrated with a toothpick.    Remove saucepan from heat and let the pears cool in the poaching liquid for  one hour. Remove the pears with a slotted spoon, cover and refrigerate.    Reduce the poaching liquid to 1/2 cup. Strain it and add it to the pears.  Chill 2 hours or overnight.    Remove the pears, drain them over the bowl and slice the wide end on the  bias. Place 2 halves on each serving plate with the stem ends touching and  press down lightly to fan them out.    Spoon 3 tablespoons of reduced liquid over each serving. Garnish the stem  ends with a sprig of mint.    >From Taste Show #TS4796    Recipe by: David Rosengarten Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #548 by "Master  Harper Gaellon" <gaellon@inch.com> on Apr 4, 1997
