Tabbouli #03
Roma tomatos, Parsley, Cinnamon, -(up to), Lemon juice, Allspice, Bulghur wheat, Green onions, olive oil, Cucumber, -(up to), Salt, 
The middle eastern dish Tabouli uses bulghur wheat. Its an excellent hot  day side dish. My recipe is from the Lebanese side of the family. All  mesurements are to taste -- Im not wild about too much parsley so I use  smaller amounts.    Pour hot water over the bughur and let soak until soft and most of the  water has been absorbed. Mix the diced vegies by hand then add the bulghur  and mix some more. add lemon juice and olive oil to get the right flavor  and consistency. Add the spice(s) and salt and mix a bit more. Refrigerate,  eat and enjoy.    JDURBIN@NL.ORACLE.COM    (JASON DURBIN)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
