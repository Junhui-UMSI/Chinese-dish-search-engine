Melt one stick of butter with the four ounces unsweetened chocolate. Let  cool. Cream the remaining one stick of butter with sugar, salt, and cake  flour. Add the eggs slowly and blend until smooth. Add the melted chocolate  mixture, the vanilla and the walnuts. Fold in by hand with a rubber  spatula. Spray sides and bottom of an 8-inch square pan. Pour the brownie  mixture into the pan and spread out evenly with your spatula. Bake at 350  degress for 30 to 40 minutes. You may also use a 9-by-13 pan, but brownies  will be thinner. Adjust your time accordingly. Cool and cut into 12  servings. Top each brownie with a whole walnut and drizzle with melted  semisweet chocolate. Serve cold or warm with ice cream and hot fudge sauce.  Recipe can be doubled. Use a 12-by-16-by-1 inch pan.
