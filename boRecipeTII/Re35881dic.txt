Sauce:  ======         Debone the duck, reserve the ducks legs for this dish and keep  the remainder of the duck for another dish.         Chop up the duck bones and place them in a heavy pan with heated  olive oil.  Add onion, carrot, and brown.         Add quartered tomato, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, and salt.  Deglaze with red wine and veal stock, then cook for approximately 1  hour.         Strain sauce and reserve.    Stuffing:  =========         Put all of the pork, bacon, and chicken liver through a meat  grinder.         In a saute pan, heat up the butter and cook the shallot.         In a bowl, mix the chopped ground meats, shallot, egg yolk,  chopped truffle, cream, salt and pepper.  Set aside.    Assembly:  =========         Peel the turnips and shape them into small spears.  Place the  turnips in a small saucepan, cover with water, add butter and salt,  then bring to a boil.         When liquid is almost evaporated, add 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  Continue to cook until a brown glaze forms in the pan.         Deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup duck sauce and reserve for garnish.         Debone the duck leg (trying to keep all of the meat in one piece)  and pound the meat flat.         Lay caul fat on flat surface and cut into 5 x 5 inch squares.  Place a deboned leg on each square, salt and pepper the meat.         Place some of the stuffing in the center of each leg.  Close the  leg over the stuffing and caul fat over the leg - shaping it all in  the form of a chop.         Place in a buttered pan and cook in 475 F oven for 20 - 25  minutes.         Heat reserved sauce, whipping in small pieces of cold butter.  Adjust the seasoning.         To serve, slice the duck and place pieces in the center of a  serving plate, garnish with turnips and add sauce.
