Pickled Jalapenos #2
Peppers, Water, Water, Sugar, Vinegar, Salt, Prepared horseradish, Garlic, 
Cut 2 slits in each pepper. Dissolve salt in the 4 qt water, pour over  peppers and let stand 12-18 hours. Drain, rinse, and drain thoroughly.     Combine remaining ingredients, simmer 15 minutes. Remove garlic. Pack  peppers into hot jars, leave 1/4 inch headspace. Heat pickling liquid to  boiling. Pour, while boiling hot, over peppers in each jar, keeping to the  1/4 inch headspace with liquid, also. Adjust caps, process for 10 minutes  in boiling water bath. (pints and 1/2 pints) Yield is about 8 pints.     Note: The liquid from the jars after the peppers are gone makes an  EXCELLENT marinade for Texas Feta Cheese (see recipe). Very spicy, but  good home made cheese.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
