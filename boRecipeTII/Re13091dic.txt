Witchs Brew
Club soda, Apples, Purple grape juice, Grapes, 
Mix the grape juice and soda in a pitcher.  Halve the grapes and take out  the seeds.  Cut the apple into small chunks. Float the fruit in the brew  just before serving; by magic, the grapes and apples will look just like  eyes and teeth. Make a swizzle broomstick from a straw and black paper cut  into a fringe.
