Here are some variations on the usual butter spritz cookies. The first two  are from _The Complete Cookie_ by Barry Bluestein and Kevin Morrissey.    Preheat the oven to 375 F. To make the dough, put the pistachios and 1/4  cup of the flour in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel  blade.  Process to a fine grind. In a large mixing bowl, combine the  butter, sugars, and egg yolks. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed  until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the ground nuts and the  remaining 2 cups flour.  Stir with a wooden spoon just to incorporate and  form a dough. Press the dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, using a cookie  press with a wreath-shaped disk. Bake for 9 minutes, until golden brown.  Let the cookies cool on the sheets for 1 minute before transferring them to  wire racks to finish cooling. For the glaze, combine the confectioners  sugar and cream in a small bowl. Mix well with a fork or a small whisk.  Line a work surface with aluminum foil or wax paper.  Place the racks on  which the cookies have cooled onto the lined surface.  Brush the wreaths  with glaze and sprinkle with the chopped nuts.
