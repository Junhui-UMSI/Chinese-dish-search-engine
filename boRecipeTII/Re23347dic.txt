Tuna with Mint-Mango Chutney
Mango; firm-ripe, salt and pepper, Serrano pepper; minced, Fresh mint; chopped, Ginger; minced, Fresh lime juice, Tuna steaks; * see note, Mint sprigs; for garnish, Orange juice, 
* Notes: The tuna steaks (4) should be about 1 inch thick and 6 ounces  each. Recommended tune is yellowfin (ahi), albacore, or bluefin. You may  use 1/4 teaspoon of fresh minced habanero pepper for the serrano pepper if  you wish.    Combine the mint, orange juice, lime juice, ginger, and serrano pepper.  Pour about a third of the mixture into a large heavy-duty plastic food bag  or nonreactive bowl; set the remaining mixture aside. Rinse the fish and  pat dry. Add it to the bag or covered bowl and seal. Rotate the bag to  distribute the marinade and place it in a shallow pan. Refrigerate for at  least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours, turning the fish occasionally.    Meanwhile, peel the mango, slicing fruit off each side and from the edges  of the pit. Cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Stir these cubes into the reserved  marinade and set aside.    Remove the fish from the bag and drain, discarding the marinade from the  bag. Arrange the fish on a cooking grate. Place the lid on the grill. Cook,  turning once halfway through the cooking time, until the fish is opaque but  still moist in the center, about 10 minutes; cut to test for doneness.    Transfer the fish to a platter or individual plates, top with the mango  mixture, garnish with the mint sprigs, salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
