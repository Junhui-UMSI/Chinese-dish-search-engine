Meanwhile, heat oil in a soup pot. Add the onion, garlic, salt, turmeric,  cumin seeds, ground cumin, and bay leaves. Saute over medium heat for 5 to  10 minutes or until the onions are soft.    Add 6 cups of water, including the reserved cooking water from lentils, if  any. Add the canned crushed tomatoes with juice and bring to a boil. Lower  heat to a simmer, partially cover and cook for another 15 minutes or so.  The timing is not exact.    Stir in the chickpeas and lentils and cook for about 5 minutes to warm  through. The legumes should not become mushy. Season to taste with the two  peppers and lemon juice; adjust salt. Serve hot with some yogurt, a  sprinkling of parsley or mint, and currants, if desired.
