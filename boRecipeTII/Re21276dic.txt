1.  Heat oven to 375 degrees.    2.  Combine sugar and Crisco in large bowl. Beat at medium speed of  electric mixer until well blended. Add eggs, syrup, and vanilla. Beat until  well blended and fluffy.    3.  Combine 3 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add  gradually to creamed mixture at low speed. Mix until well blended. Divide  dough into 4 quarters. TIP: If dough is too sticky or too soft to roll,  wrap each quarter of dough with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.    4.  Spread 1 tablespoon flour on large sheet of waxed paper. Place  one-fourth of dough on floured paper. Flatten slightly with hands. Turn  dough over and cover with another large sheet of waxed paper. Roll dough to  1/4-inch thickness. Cut out with floured cutter. Transfer to ungreased  baking sheet with large pancake turner. Place 2 inches apart. Sprinkle with  granulated sugar or colored sugar crystals, or leave plain to frost when  cooled.    5.  Bake one baking sheet at a time for 5-9 minutes, depending on the size  of your cookies (bake smaller, thinner cookies closer to 5 minutes; larger  cookies closer to 9 minutes). DO NOT OVERBAKE. Cool 2 minutes on baking  sheet. Place sheets of foil on countertop. Remove cookies to foil to cool  completely; then frost if desired. Makes about 3-4 dozen cookies.
