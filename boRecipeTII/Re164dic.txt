Kugel
Red potatoes, Yellow onion, Eggs, Baking Powder, All-purpose flour, Bacon, Salt and pepper to taste, 
Here are four traditional Lithuanian recipes from my files. (I run a small catering business specializing in ethnic foods.) Most of these are family recipes from Lithuanian friends. I think one is from an old church cookbook from a church that is predominantly Lithuanian.      Grate potatoes and onion.      Add eggs, baking powder and flour to potatoes and eggs and blend.   Mix in salt and pepper.      Pour into greased 10 inch cast iron skillet (or oven proof 12" x 7" casserole or baking dish) and place in 400 degree oven. Top with bacon bake at 400 degrees until the bacon is crisp and the top of the kugel is brown.      Remove from pan and serve.
