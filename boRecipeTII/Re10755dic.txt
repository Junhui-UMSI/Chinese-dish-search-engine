Quick Tvp Barbeque Sandwiches
Water, Water or other liquid for, Onion, chopped fine, Or 2 cloves garlic, minced, Sauteing, Your favorite barbeque, TVP, Sauce, 
Mix the TVP with the 1/2 cup water and set aside for 5 minutes.    Saute onion in about 1 Tbs. liquid until almost cleear.  Then add garlic  and cook for another minute. Add the reconstituted TVP. Add the barbeque  sauce until the mixture is the right consistency for sandwiches. Heat  thoroughly and serve.    Its so easy!  And if you want to avoid commercial barbeque sauce and make  your own, Im sure there are a lot of good recipes for homemade bbq sauce  out there.  (Post em!)  Something strange (to me at least) that is  available here in South Carolina is a mustard-based sauce; Id never seen  it before I moved here, but now that Ive discovered it, Im addicted! It  works great in this recipe.  If anyone out there has a recipe for  mustard-based barbeque sauce, Id love the recipe.
