In a small saucepan place the rosemary, garlic, and Chablis.  Cook the  ingredients on medium heat for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the liquid is  reduced to 2 tablespoons. Pour marinade into a blender and pur?e it.  Add the mustard and blend it in. With the blender still running,  slowly dribble in the olive oil. Season the mustard paste with the  salt and set it aside. Season the lamb with the salt and pepper.  Coat both sides with the mustard paste. In a large saute pan place  the butter and heat it on medium high until it has melted. Add the  lamb racks and saute them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until  they are lightly browned. Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the lamb  racks in a baking pan and roast them for 10 minutes, or until they  are medium rare.  Turn the lamb so that all sides are evenly browned.  Remove the lamb racks from the oven and place them on a warm plate.  Let them rest for 5 minutes. Slice the lamb between each bone. On  each of 6 individual serving plates place the Northern White Beans.  Place the lamb on top.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
