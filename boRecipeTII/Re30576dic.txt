PASTA POT - cook pasta until al dente. Drain well. Toss with butter  flavored canola. LARGE SKILLET or WOK - Fry prosciutto or bacon until  crisp; add a little olive oil, as needed, to prevent sticking.    Option #1:  Combine the herb(s), radicchio, cheese, pepper and meat in a  serving bowl and toss. Add hot "buttered" pasta and toss. Distribute  servings to heated bowls. Top with cheese.    Option #2:  Push meat aside in the wok or skillet and stir fry radicchio  and herbs for about 3 minutes, until just wilted and the "cranberry" color  darkens ("maroon").  Add the pasta to the wok. Toss. Salt and pepper to  taste. Transfer to a heated serving bowl. Top with cheese: some shavings,  some grated.    VARIATIONS:  __Any long stranded pasta.  __Harlequin pasta: plain, beet and  spinach.  __Equal amounts of linguine and angel hair.  Note the different  cooking times on package.  __Shorten the pasta:  break length in two.  __Equal amounts of fresh basil, or lemon basil and fresh tarragon. __Good  quality turkey bacon instead of prosciutto. Cut  bacon into squarish  pieces; then fry.
