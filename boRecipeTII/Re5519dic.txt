Pineapple Julius
Sugar, ice, Crushed pineapple  , Water, Egg whites, Vanilla, 
Blend on high for about 1 minute, maybe a little more if you want it less  frozen.    Try 1 cup frozen strawberries, thawed, instead of the pineapple for a  strawberry julius.    If you dont want to use the egg whites, you might try a product sold at  GNC, called 100% Egg Protein (vanilla flavor).  Its mainly powdered egg  white, with vanilla flavoring and aspartame. It will make a great "julius"  of any flavour.   Careful, though-a little goes a long way.  If you use a 1 oz scoop per  drink as the label suggests, the drink will be pretty thick.  A tablespoon  may be enough.
