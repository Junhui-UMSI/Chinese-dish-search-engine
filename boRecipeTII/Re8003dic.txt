Potato and Apple Skillet Cake
Baking Powder, Large cooking apples, Cinnamon, A little sugar to taste, Flour, Butter, Cloves, Butter, FOR THE APPLE MIXTURE, FOR THE POTATO CAKE MIXTURE, Salt, 
First, make a portion of potato-cake mixture:    Rub the butter into the flour.  Add the salt and baking powder and mix  well.  Add the potatoes and knead briefly until the mixture is well  combined.    Divide the dough into two parts and roll out into two circles on a  well-floured board, using a floured rolling pin. Use a plate slightly  smaller than your skillet to trim the circles if necessary.    Peel the apples and slice them thinly.  Layer them evenly on one circle of  dough.  Cover with the other circle of dough and pinch the edges together.  Cook gently in a preheated greased (ideally, buttered) skillet at medium  heat, turning once to cook the other side (you may want to use a plate to  help make turning easier). Each side should take about 15 minutes to become  a moderate toasty brown.    When the apples are cooked through, carefully lift back the top of the cake  and sprinkle with sugar, cloves and cinnamon.  Add a large pat of butter.    Replace the top of the cake and leave on the heat for another 5 minutes to  allow the sugar, butter and cinnamon to melt together.  If desired, spread  the top of the cake thinly with marmalade or apple jelly and put the pan  briefly under the broiler to melt and glaze the cake. Serve cut in wedges,  and eat very hot with cream or a rich pouring custard.
