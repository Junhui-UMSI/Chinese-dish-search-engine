In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in milk, honey,  shortening, and wheat germ. Using a wooden spoon or electric mixer,  gradually mix in 3-1/2 cups of the flour. Beat until dough pulls away from  sides of bowl in stretchy strands. Cover and let stand in a warm place  until light and bubbly (about 40 minutes). Meanwhile, combine 1-1/2 cups of  the flour with the baking powder and the 1-3/4 teaspoons salt; set aside.  Punch dough down and stir in flour mixture. Turn onto a lightly floured  board and knead until smooth (about 5 minutes), adding flour as needed to  prevent sticking. Divide kneaded dough into 4 equal portions. Cut each  quarter into 12 equal pieces and roll each piece into a rope about 24  inches long. Cut in half and twist each half into a pretzel. Place  pretzels, slightly apart and with loose ends turned under, on well-greased  baking sheets (at least 12 by 15 inches). Brush pretzels with beaten egg  and sprinkle lightly with coarse salt (omitted). Bake in a preheated 400~  oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden; transfer to a rack. After all  pretzels have been baked, turn oven off. Pile baked pretzels onto 2  ungreased baking sheets and set in turned-off oven for 2 to 3 hours or  overnight, until thoroughly dried (break one to test). 8 dozen  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "M.
