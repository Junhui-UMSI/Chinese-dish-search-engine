submitted by: rstewart@infobahn.icubed.com (Karen Stewart, McDonald, PA)  Here is a recipe that I got out of Cookbook Digest.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush a 2-quart baking dish (a souffle dish  works well) with the melted butter.    In a small bowl stir together the garlic, parsley, cheese and pepper.    Layer one-third of the potatoesw in the prepared dish and sprinkle one  third of the garlic-cheese mixture over the top. Dot with 1 Tbsp. of the  butter pieces. Repeat the layers once and then top with the remaining  potatoes. Pour the stock evenly over the layers. Sprinkle the remaining  garlic-cheese mixture evenly over the top and dot with the remaining butter  pieces. Butter a piece of aluminum foil on one side large enough to cover  the dish. Place it over the dish, buttered side down.    Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the potatoes  are tender and the top is brown and crusty, 30 to 40 minutes longer.  Serve  immediately.    DAVE <DAVIDG@CLAM.RUTGERS.EDU>    RECIPEINTERNET LIST SERVER    RECIPE ARCHIVE - 8 APRIL 1996    From the RECIPEinternet: Recipes from Around the World recipe list.
