Pretzels for the Breadmaker
Yeast, Salt, Margarine, PRETZELS, water, Flour, WATER FOR BATH, Water, Sugar, Baking soda, 
Add into the bread machine in this order.  Set on manual.    FORMING: Cut dough into short strips, roll into ropes and shape into  pretzels. Cover with a tea towel and let rise for 45 minutes.    BATH: In a cast iron or OTHER NONALUMINUM pan, bring almost to a boil 4  cups of water and 5 teaspoons of baking soda. Gently place (by hand or  using slotted spoon) the pretzels into the water for approximately 15  seconds on each side turning once.  Do NOT let water come to a boil. Remove  pretzels and place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt  (kosher). Bake at 475 for 12 minutes.    NOTE: In my oven it took only about 10 minutes so watch carefully. Do NOT  make the strips too fat; they really puff up. If you are on a salt-free  diet use sesame, poppy, garlic; whatever you like on the outside...the  WHOLE family, both upstairs and downstairs loved them and the DAK did all  the hard work.    * If you use a machine that needs the water first add ingredients in  reverse order.
