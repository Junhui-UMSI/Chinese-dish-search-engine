Post Raisin Bran Muffins
Salt, Raisin Bran cereal, Applesauce, Margarine, Brown Sugar, Baking Powder, Egg, Cinnamon sugar, Flour, Dried apricots, Skim milk, 
Heat oven to 400 (375 if you are making extra large muffins, as I do). Mix  flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix cereal and milk in a  separate bowl and let stand 3 minutes. Add to the cereal and milk, the egg,  applesauce, sugar and margarine. Add to flour mix, with the apricots if you  are using them, and stir until just moistened. Pour into sprayed muffin  pan, (sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar, if desired) and bake 20 minutes until  golden. Makes 12.    NOTE, if you like the extra large (Texas-sized ) muffins like I do, bake at  375, for 20-30 minutes (closer to 30, but check at 20). Makes 6    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by jneger@juno.com (Nicki A Eger) on Feb 21, 1998
