Kirstie Alleys Chicken Parmesan
Boneless chicken breasts, Garlic, Butter, Sour cream (we used light), Parmesan cheese, Pepper, Paprika, 
Preheat oven to 375F. Pound chicken breasts lightly to flatten. Heat garlic in butter to melt and cook slightly. If omitting butter, saute garlic in a tsp. or 2 of olive oil. Stir half the garlic mixture into sour cream. Lather each breast generously on both sides with sour cream mixture. Roll in seasoned parmesan. Lay breasts in foil lined pan. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. Drizzle with remaining garlic butter (if using) half way through cooking time. Run under broiler for a few minutes to brown before serving.  Garnish with lemon slices.
