Bell" <tdbell@altair.csustan.edu>  Heat a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan; add the barley and cook the grain,  stirring constantly, until it smells toasty. Remove the saucepan from the  heat. Averting your face, add the water (it will bubble up furiously)  Return the saucepan to the heat, cover and cook for about 2O to 25 minutes  or until barley has absorbed the liquid and is just tender. Transfer the  barley to a sieve and drain under cold water; pat dry and set aside.    During the time it takes to cook the barley, peel, halve and seed the  cucumbers and cut them into 1/2 inch half moons. Halve and seed the  zucchini and yellow squash, cut them into 1/2 inch half moons and parboil  them for a minute, drain and pat dry.    In the bottom of a mixing bowl combine the mayonnaise, vinegar and dill;  season well with salt and pepper. To the dressing add the cooked barley,  cucumbers and squash and toss well; adjust the seasoning.    On the outside edge of a serving platter, make a ring of drained sliced  pickled beets. Pile the barley salad in the middle and center some  watercress leaves in the middle of the salad. Yield: 4 servings    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #156    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
