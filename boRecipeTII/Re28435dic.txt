1. In a large pot over high heat, bring to a boil 2 quarts of water. Cook  noodles until barely tender (about 5 minutes). Drain and refresh under cold  water, then set aside.    2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil an 8-inch ring mold or an  8-inch-square baking pan.    3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat butter and saute green  onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms for 5 minutes. Add flour and salt  substitute and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Pour in milk and cook,  stirring frequently, until thick (about 8 minutes). Stir in yogurt and  pepper and remove from heat.    4. Separate eggs. In a small bowl combine all egg whites and beat until  stiff. In a separate bowl beat egg yolks until foamy, then add to sauteed  vegetables. Add drained noodles and fold in egg whites, then parsley. Pour  mixture into prepared pan.    5. Bake until set (about 30 minutes). Unmold and serve hot.
