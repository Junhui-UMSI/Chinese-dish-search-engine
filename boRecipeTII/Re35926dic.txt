1. Remove stems from mushroom caps; chop stems into small pieces and put  into a large bowl. Add remaining ingredients and mix together with your  hands so that the mixture sticks together. If mixture is too dry, add  another beaten egg.    2. Place mushroom caps in heavy baking pan and fill each cap with a mound  of mushroom mixture. Use leftover mixture to cover mushrooms already  stuffed.    3. Cover pan and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes or until cheese is  bubbling. Serve immediately.
