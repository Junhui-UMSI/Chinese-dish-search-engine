Vanilla Bean-Peach Jam
Pectin, Lemon juice, Sugar, Peaches, Vanilla beans, Bourbon, 
Peel, pit and chop peaches.    In a bowl combine sugar and vanilla bean (or 2 beans may be used). 1 tsp.  vanilla extract may be used instead; if so, omit this step. Cover and leave  on counter for 48 hours, stirring occasionally. In a large heavy saucepan  combine peaches, lemon juice, and pectin. Cover over high heat, stirring  constantly, about 5 minutes or until mixture comes to a full rolling boil  (one that cannot be stirred down).    Stir in sugar and vanilla bean or beans if using.    Return to full rolling boil (this takes 5 to 7 minutes.) Boil hard,  uncovered, for one minute, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and  carefully stir in bourbon and vanilla extract if using. Remove vanilla  bean, if using, and skim off foam. Ladle at once into hot, sterilized  half-pint jars, leaving 1/4" head space. Wipe jar rims,; adjust lids.  Process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes (start timing when water  returns to boiling). Makes 6 half-pints.
