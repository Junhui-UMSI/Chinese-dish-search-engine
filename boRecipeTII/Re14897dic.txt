The 3rd place winner in the Chicago Tribunes 1996 Annual Holiday Cookie  Contest; by Marilyn Cahill of Chicago, Illinois.    1. Heat oven to 350F. Beat 3/4 cup of the sugar, butter and lard in large  bowl of electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy; about 3  minutes. Add egg yolk and vanilla; beat until smooth. Beat in flour,  cinnamon, anise seed and salt until well mixed. Stir in pecans.    2. Roll walnut-size pieces of dough between palms to make round balls. Put  remaining 1/4 cup sugar in pie plate; roll dough balls in sugar. Place  balls 5 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Press each ball with bottom  of a glass dipped in sugar to about 1/4-inch thickness.    3. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven to 300F and continue baking until lightly  browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove to cooling rack.    Test Kitchen Note: An additional 1/2 cup butter can be substituted for the  lard. Also, you may bake the cookies at a constant 325F; cooking time  should be about the same.    Source: Chicago Tribune, December 4, 1996.
