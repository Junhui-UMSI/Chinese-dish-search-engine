2-row pale malted barley, Light dry malt extract, 80 Lovibond crystal malt,, Chocolate malt, Wheat malt, Brown sugar (in boil), (boiling), Hallertauer, Wyeast 1098 "English", (Whitbread) ale yeas, Cascade, Willamette, Northern Brewer (7.4 AAU), (priming), Smoked, 
Heat 18 quarts of mash water to 140 degrees, ph 5.3. Mash-in for 5  min-  utes at 130 degrees.  Continue without a protein rest. Starch conversion of  60 minutes, 158-150 degrees. Mash-out for 5 minutes at 168  degrees. Sparge  with 5 gallons water at 168 degrees, ph 5.7. Add brown sugar  and boil for  90 minutes. Add boiling hops at 30 minutes. Dry hop  with  1/2 ounce each  of Willamette and Hallertauer 3 days  after  pitching,  and bottled 4 weeks  later. Its confession time. This was intended to be a Scottish Wee Heavy,  but works much better as an Old Ale. I just havent quite captured that  uniquely  malty characteristic of Scotch ales, but Im still  trying.  I  tried  smoking  the crystal malt over a peat fire, which  really  wasnt  terribly  successful in imparting peaty flavors to the malt.  Next  time  Ill  get  the peat really soggy; perhaps that will  work  better.  Its  rich,  vinous, with complex port-like ethers and not a hint  of  astrin-  gency (a common hard-water problem) or off-flavors. Next time I brew it,  though, Ill delete the wheat malt (plenty of head, for the style, with-  out  it)  and the brown sugar (the vinousness is too much for  a  Scotch  ale), substitute 2 pounds dextrine malt or flaked barley (still  mulling  this  over) for an equal weight of pale malt, and smoke the cystal  more  heavily.
