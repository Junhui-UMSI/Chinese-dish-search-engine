SALAD: Arrange the lettuce, tomatoes, onion, carrot & cucumber in a salad  bowl & lightly toss.  Add the bean curd & sprouts. Top with the peanut-  coconut milk dressing & garnish with potato chips. DRESSING: In saucepan  over medium heat, stir the coconut milk & red curry paste together until  the mixture turns to a pale amber & a thin coat of oil appears on the  surface. Add the remaining ingredients & stir over a low heat for 7 to 10  minutes, or until all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. The colour will  be a pale cocoa brown. Let cool to room temperature for 1 hour before  serving with the salad. The dressing will keep in the refrigerator for a  month, but it does have a tendency to thicken.  To bring it back to its  correct consistency, add 1/2 ts to 1 tb white vinegar & stir vigorously.
