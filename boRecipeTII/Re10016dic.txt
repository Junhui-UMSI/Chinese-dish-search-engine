Quaglie Al Forno
Quails, about 4 oz apiece, Black Pepper, Dry white wine, Butter, Fresh or dried sage leaves, Blanched bacon, Salt, 
PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Rinse quails and pat them dry with paper towels. Lay  a round of pancetta over breast and thighs of each bird and tie securely  with string. Melt butter in an oven-proof casserole just large enough to  hold quails. Add sage leaves and quails. Brown them over medium heat 3-to-4  minutes on each side. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and pour on the wine.  Set casserole in oven and bake 20-to-25 minutes, until tender, turning  quails once after 10 minutes. Remove strings and serve in a heated dish.
