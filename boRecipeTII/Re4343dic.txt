Persimmon Fudge
Chopped fresh dates, Finely chopped nuts, Light corn syrup, Sugar, milk, Cream, Unsalted butter, Persimmon pulp (4-5 fruits), 
In a large, heavy pot, mix sugar, milk, cream, corn syrup, and persimmon  pulp. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or  until mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (235-240F). Meanwhile, butter a  9x13-inch baking pan.    When fudge is the proper temperature, remove from heat and cool in the pan  until barely warm. Using a wooden spoon, beat in the butter. When mixture  thickens and butter is absorbed, add dates.    Spread fudge in the prepared pan. When completely cool, cut into small  squares. (If desired, squares may be rolled into balls and then rolled in  chopped nuts.) Chill 1 day. May freeze 3 weeks.    NOTE: To prepare persimmons, scoop soft persimmon pulp out of skins,  discarding seeds and leaves. Puree in a food processor or blender.    How to chop dates: Chop with a chefs knife (with a blade 6 to 8 inches  long) dusted with powdered sugar to keep dates from sticking. Or cut dates  with scissors.
