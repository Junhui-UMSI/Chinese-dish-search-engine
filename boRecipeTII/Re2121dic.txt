Source: The Spice and Spirit of Kosher Cooking    Cut the margarine into the flour. Mix the rest together and add slowly to  the flour. Shape the dough into a ball and cover and refrigerate for 2  hours.    Mix all the filling ingredients together. Set aside. Mix glaze ingredients  together and set aside. Roll the dought into 4inch squares. Put a spoonful  of filling in the center of each square and fold into a triangle. Press the  edges together with the tines of a fork. Make five small slits on the top  of each turnover with the tip of a knife.    Bake on a cookie sheet for 15-20 minutes. While still hot, drizzle with  glaze.    This dough is also good for knishes, rugelach or pot pie crusts.    I forgot....the apple turnovers require a double recipe of the basic dough  recipe. Sorry!
