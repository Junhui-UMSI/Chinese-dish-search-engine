"The Complete Book of Bread Machine Baking", edited by Lara Pizzorno    I dont know where they get the title since this is not 100% WW. However, I  have been told that this is the best bread that I have made so far by two  different sources. The crust has a nice crunch and the bread is light with  a delicious flavor. This book emphasizes healthy breads, that is why they  suggest canola instead of vegetable oil, unbleached flour instead of all  purpose flour, and why they add wheat germ. I dont doubt that you can  easily substitute.    "Therese Klodnicki" <Terry_Klodnicki@msn.com>  Posted to recipelu-digest by "Christopher E. Eaves" <cea260@airmail.net> on  Mar 04, 1998
