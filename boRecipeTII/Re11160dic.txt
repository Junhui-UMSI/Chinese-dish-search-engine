I cant remember who wanted ideas for different mixes of beans etc. to put  in jars but I found a great book with TONS of ideas. ITs called The  Perfect Mix (90 Gift-Giving Ideas for Bread, Soup, Dessert, and Other  Homemade Mixes) by Diane Phillips. (copyright 1993) It gives ideas on how  to package gifts, which ones go together nicely and recipes for the mixes.  Heres one example:    Makes 1 3/4 cups    The perfect accompaniment for sauteed chicken or broiled cornish game hens.  Present this rice mix layered in a glass jar, and tie ribbons to the neck  of the jar.    In a glass jar that holds 1 3/4 cups, pour the rice into the bottom. Layer  the rest of the ingredients in the order given.    To prepare:          4    cups water    In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the Wild Rice Mix and  reduce the heat. Cover and simmer about 50 minutes, adding more water if  needed. (This also had 3 tablespoons butter which I omitted)    This is just one of many ideas in this book! There are ideas on desserts  too. Thanks to whoever brought up this idea!!  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n151    From: "Karen M. Ferner" <kferner@mcls.rochester.lib.ny.us>    Date: Fri, 13 Sep 1996 15:23:14 -0400 (EDT)
