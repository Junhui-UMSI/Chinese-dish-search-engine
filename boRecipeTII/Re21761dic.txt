Apple-Brie Cheese Omelet
Cream, Butter, Apples, Eggs, Butter, salt and pepper, Diced Brie cheese, 
Saute apple in butter. Beat together eggs, cream, and salt & pepper until  blended but not frothy.  Melt butter in omelette pan over high heat until  foam begins to recede but before beginning to color. Pour in egg mixture  and prepare omelette, beating to lighten but still allowing it to set on  the bottom.    Fill with sauteed apples and diced Brie cheese cubes. Fold or roll and  slide out of pan onto a heated plate.    Gails Notes: YUM!  Good luck trying to "dice" Brie, tho! <ggg>    Source: Dairy Hollow House, Eureka Spgs., AR    Posted on GEnie Food & Wine RT Aug 31, 1993 by FOOD.N.WINE [Gail]    MM by MMCONV and Sylvia Steiger, GEnie THE.STEIGERS, CI$ 71511,2253,  Internet sylvia.steiger@lunatic.com, moderator of GT Cookbook and PlanoNet  Lowfat & Luscious echoes
