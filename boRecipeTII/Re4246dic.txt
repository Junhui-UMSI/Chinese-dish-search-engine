Perfect Steamed Broccoli (Mf)
broccoli, 
Cut off 2 inches from the stem end and peel the stalks. Bring an inch of  water to a boil, set a vegetable steamer over the water, place the broccoli  on the steamer, cover and cook 3 to 4 minutes or until the broccoli is  cooked through but still firm. An alternative way is to separate the  florets from the stalks; steam the florets and reserve the stalks for  another day.
