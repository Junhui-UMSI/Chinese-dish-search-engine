Banana Sour Cream Coffee Cake
Butter or margarine, Sugar, Eggs, bananas, Vanilla, Sour cream, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Salt, Pecans, Sugar, Cinnamon, Flour, 
In bowl, cream butter with sugar. Beat in eggs..Add mashed bananas, vanilla  and sour cream. Sift together flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Fold  into the creamed mixture, stirring just to blend. In separate bowl, combine  finely chopped nuts, 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle half over bottom  of well greased bundt or tube pan. Spoon in half the batter. Sprinkle with  remaining nuts and cover with balance of batter.      Bake at 350 degrees approx. 45 minutes or until cake is nicely browned.. I  always test with toothpick. Cool in pan on rack for 10 minutes. Serves  8-10===(To make it plain, you can eliminate the cinnamon mixture and bake  in tube pan.) I always put the nuts into the plain cake, instead.    You can also substitute 3 egg whites instead of 2 eggs, for less  cholesterol..    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by rbusman~~at;juno.com (RITA BUSMAN) on Aug 31,  1998,
