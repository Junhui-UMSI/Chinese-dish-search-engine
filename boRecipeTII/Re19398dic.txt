Lo Mein refers to the process for cooking noodles; mein means noodle in  Chinese.    Noodles:  Add soft noodles to boiling salted water; stir with chop- sticks  & cook until noodles lose their floury taste but are still firm.  Immediately drain in colander & rinse in cold water to arrest cooking  process.  If you hold noodles for more than 10 minutes toss them with a  little oil to prevent sticking.    Vegetables:  Soak Jyo mushrooms for 2 hours in warm water (1 hour for Nami  mushrooms); slice in thin strips. Slice celery with the grain in thin  strips about 3" long.  Cut bamboo shoots in strips to match celery.    Stir-Frying:  Heat wok to medium-high. When hot, dribble oil around side of  pan. Add salt; stir briefly. Add mushrooms & bamboo shoots; stir for about  30 seconds. Add celery, stir vigorously for 30 seconds. Push vegetables up  side of wok; add broth & sugar, bring to boil.    Add noodles, a handful at a time, stirring them into broth for about 20  seconds. Combine vegetables & noodles, cover wok, steam for 30 seconds.  Push all ingredients to side.  If necessary, thicken juices slightly with  cornstarch paste.  Add paste a little at a time, stir- ring constantly.  Serve immediately.
