Although this recipe calls for beef you can substitute any other meat or  vegetable.     Put the rice and four times its volume of stock/water into a thick  bottomed pan.  Add the star anise, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper and half  the spring onions. Bring to the boil then simmer, stirring occaisionally,  until the rice turns into a thick glop - about 40 minutes. Add more water  if needed.     Remove and discard the spring onion and add the beef. Cook for two  minutes. Add the beans and cook for a further two minutes.     Chop the remaing spring onions and add, along with a dash of the sesame  oil.    Goes very well with chinese chilli sauce and/or soy sauce.
