Date: Mon, 12 Feb 1996 09:09:19 +0200 (EET)    From: David Barnett <davidb@techunix.technion.ac.il>    Thats interesting - I have her "Jewish Holiday Kitchen" cookbook,  which also has a recipe for Zhug, but it was neither authentic nor  good. The following is the translation of a recipe given to me by a  Yemenite woman, who grows her own tiny peppers (I have no idea what  variety, but they are much hotter than seranos). One thing the  Yemenites do with it is make a "dipping sauce" (more of a spread,  actually) that is eaten with bread, called Helbeh.  This is adopted  from Joan Nathans recipe:    1. Let the fenugreek seeds soak in water for several hours or  overnight.    2. Pour off any remaining liquid, leaving a moist paste.    3. Using a wooden spoon, whip in, little by little, up to 1/2 cup  water into the paste. Then mix in the zhug, lemon juice (JN calls for  1 tablespoon, or to taste), and the tomato (JN says to grate it, I  just mash it up).    4. Adjust seasonings to taste.  It should be very spicy. This can  either be eaten plain with bread (I would use pita), or served with a  meal like a chutney.
