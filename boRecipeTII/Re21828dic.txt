1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Prepare muffin pan.    2.  In large bowl, mix first 5 ingredients.  In small bowl, beat honey,  milk, oil and egg until blended; stir into flour mixture just until flour  is moistened (batter will be lumpy). Fold in apples.    3.  Spoon batter into cups to come almost to the top of each cup.  Bake 25  minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of muffin comes out clean.  Immediately remove muffins from pan; serve warm or cool on wire rack. Makes  12 muffins.  About 155 calories each. NOTES  : I always leave the apples unpeeled but peel if you wish.  You may also  bake this as a quickbread in which case, use a standard loaf pan and bake  for 50-60 minutes at 350-375 degrees. Pans made from ceramic, glass, black,  dark or polished metals exhibit different baking characteristics. Baking  times and temperatures should be adjusted accordingly.
