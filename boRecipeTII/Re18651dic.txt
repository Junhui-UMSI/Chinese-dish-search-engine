Preheat oven to 350 F.  On 2 cookie sheets, toast the bread cubes for 15  minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Transfer to a very large mixer  bowl. Bone the chicken and very finely chop the meat, discarding the skin.  (I do this in the food processor while chicken is still warm.) Add the  chopped vegetables and chicken meat to the bread, along with the  seasonings.  Toss. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs; add the evaporated milk  and broth.  Pour over the bread mixture and blend. The mixture will be  quite moist. Allow to stand 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 F. Transfer the  dressing to an oiled 3 quart glass casserole that is 10 inches in diameter  and 3 inches deep (at this point, dressing can be frozen for future use;  thaw before baking.) Bake dressing for 2 hours, or until the center of the  dressing puffs up and is golden brown on top.
