Spanish garlic prawns are yesterdays fashion, but are  still so enjoyable that most of us are prepared to eat  them and to hell with friends and colleagues next day.  Perhaps the vast quantity of coriander root in this  Thai version has magical properties because the  after-math doesnt seem to be severe.    Prepare a marinade by mixing together 8 crushed cloves  of garlic, 2 tablespoons washed and minced coriander  root, 2 table- spoons fish sauce, 1.5 tablespoons  brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add 500 g of  shelled and cleaned prawns and leave to marinate for  15-30 minutes.    Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan, add the prawns  and their marinade and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes or  just until the prawns are pink. Stir in the juice of a  lemon and serve immediately with rice and sliced  tomatoes and cucumber.    From an article by Meryl Constance in The Sydney  Morning Herald, 7/20/93. Courtesy Mark Herron.
