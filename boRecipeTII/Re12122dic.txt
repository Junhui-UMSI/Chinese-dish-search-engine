COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8707    In a 9-inch non-stick skillet cook the onion, the zucchini, and the peppers  with salt and black pepper to taste in 1 tablespoon of the oil over  moderate heat, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are  tender. In a bowl whisk together the eggs, 1/3 cup of the Parmesan and the  parsley, add the vegetable mixture, and stir the mixture until it is  combined well. In the skillet heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil over  moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, pour in the egg mixture,  distributing the vegetables evenly, and cook the frittata, without  stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edge is set but the center is  still soft. Sprinkle the remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan over the top. (If the  skillet handle is plastic, wrap it in a double thickness of foil.) Broil  the frittata under a preheated broiler about 4 inches from the heat for 3  to 4 minutes, or until the cheese is golden, let it cool in the skillet for  5 minutes, and run a knife around the edge. Slide the frittata onto a  serving plate, cut it into wedges, and serve it warm or at room  temperature.
