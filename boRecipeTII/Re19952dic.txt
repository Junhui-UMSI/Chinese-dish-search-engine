From checking my cookbooks, I would say that the difference between apple/  pear sauce and apple/pear butter is one of degree, the latter being  sweeter, thicker and spicier and is made by cooking down apples with apple  juice and spices. Heres a recipe from Jean Hewitts _The New York Times:  The New Natural Foods Cookbook_.    Combine apples and cider in a large kettle, bring to boil, and simmer,  covered, until apples are soft. Pass through a food mill or puree in a  blender or food processor.    Combine strained applesauce with remaining ingredients in kettle. Bring to  a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.    Cook gently, uncovered, until mixture becomes quite thick, at least 2 1/2  hours, Stir often. Pour into hot sterilized jars and seal. Process in a  boiling water bath for 15 minutes. (You could also freeze in small portions  and store what you are currently using in the refrigerator.)    Yield: about 2 quarts (8 cups is a lot of apple butter, you could cut the  recipe down or give away as gifts.)    Another suggestion: buy unsweetened apple sauce and add sugar and spices  and cook til very thick for semi-homemade apple butter.    Also, substitute ripe pears for apples or use a combination.
