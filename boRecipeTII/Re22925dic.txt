Argentinian Cheeseburger Sandwich
sandwich bun, Mozzarella cheese, ?, ham, Butter, egg, 
(The following is for one sandwich, adjust according to your needs)    Lightly toast the bun and spread with butter. Place the hamburger pattie on  the bottom section of bun, add the ham, then the egg and finally the  cheese. Broil only until cheese has melted. Top with remaining bun. Serve  immediately with preferred condiments.    Though we didnt think of it at the time, this would be great with slices  of garden fresh tomatoes.    Source: Jeffrey W.
