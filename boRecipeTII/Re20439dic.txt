Vegan Pesto
Mori-Nu Lite tofu, Garlic, Soymage parmesean, Dried, Substitute, Basil leaves, washed and, Olive oil (optional!), 
Blend or process in food processor til creamy.  This comes out looking more  like guacamole than pesto, but its yummy!    Before I found the Soymage, I tried some miso paste with the basil.  YUK!  Something about the flavors just DIDNT meld, IMHO.  Of course, YMMV!    From: Lisa <BENNETT@UNIVSCVM.CSD.SCAROLINA.EDU>. Fatfree Digest [Volume 10  Issue 10] Aug. 20, 1994.
