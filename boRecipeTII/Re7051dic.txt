Place the milk, eggs, oil and salt in blender container.  Blend at high  speed until well mixed.  Add the flour to mixture in the blender container;  blend just until batter is smooth.  Pour batter into greased popover cups,  filling 1/2 full.  Bake at 475 for 15 minutes; reduce to 350 and bake 25-30  minutes longer.  A few minutes before removing from oven, prick popover  with a fork to let steam escape. Serve hot.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
