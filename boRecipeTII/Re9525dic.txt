Prepare the pastry by stirring  flour and sugar together in a bowl. Cut in butter, egg yolk and extract.  Work the dough (which will be very crumbly) with hands to complete the  mixing. Evenly press the dough on the bottom and up the sides (to within  1/2 inchcm" of the top) of the springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven  for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove and set aside to cool while  preparing the filling.    Increase the oven temperature to 475 deg. F.  Beat the cream cheese in a  large bowl until smooth and soft. Beat in the sugars, flour, spices and  pumpkin until well blended. Add egg yolks and eggs one at a time, beating  well after each addition. Add vanilla extract, beat in well. Stir in the  cream.    Pour filling into the pastry crust. Bake for 12 minutes. Without opening  the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 deg. F degrees and leave  the cheesecake in the oven for an additional 1 hour and 15 minutes. At the  end of the baking time, turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake sitting  inside (without opening the door) until the oven cools (about 2 to 3  hours). Remove from the oven, refrigerate overnight.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
