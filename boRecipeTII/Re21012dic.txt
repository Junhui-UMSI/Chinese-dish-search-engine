Tvp Spaghetti
Garlic, olive oil, Peeled tomatoes  , Courgettes/Zuchinis, Mushrooms, Tomato Puree, Black pepper, Vegetable Stock (cube), Basil, Parsley, Red Wine, THE MINCE, Rosemary, Mixed Herbs, Spanish Onion, Oregano, Black pepper, water, Oregano, TVP, olive oil, Rosemary, 
Fry the garlic and onion in the olive oil till tender. Now add the mince  and fry for about ten minutes. It is best that the mince mixture should be  fairly dry before adding, i.e. there should not be any unabsorbed water.  Add the mushrooms and courgettes and continuing frying till tender, a  little extra olive oil may be needed at this stage as the mince mixture  will probably absorb some of the oil (dont worry, remember TVP is  virtually fat-free and the resulting sauce will still have far less fat  than the dead animal version, particularly saturated fat). Add the  tomatoes, wine and herbs and leave simmering with a lid on for about 20-25  minutes. If the sauce is still too runny add a little tomato puree to  thicken. For best results leave the sauce off the heat for a few hours to  absorb the flavours and simmer gently just before serving.    Serve with wholemeal spaghetti.
