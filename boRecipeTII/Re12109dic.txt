This recipe is Polish rather than German and is very tasty and easy (if a  bit messy to make).    Pound the beef slices until they are very thin. Spread mustard over each  side of the beef and season with salt and pepper to taste. In a small bowl  mix together the bacon, half of the onion, and the pickles. Place an equal  amount of the mixture in each beef slice and roll up carefully. Tie with  thread or string. In a large heavy dutch oven or casserole dish melt the  butter over medium heat. Brown the beef bundles on all sides. Add enough  beef broth to cover the rolls, mushrooms, the remaining onion, the bay  leaf, and additional salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, cover, then  simmer very gently for two hours or until the meat is cooked through and  very tender. Remove the bay leaf. In a small bowl mix together the flour  and sour cream. Slowly blend the mixture into the broth and stir well.  Simmer for a few minutes, stirring frequently until thickened.
