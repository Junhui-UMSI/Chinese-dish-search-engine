In a 5 quart kettle simmer beans, lard or oil,  onion, and epazote, if using, in water to cover by 2-inches, covered, 45  minutes, or until beans are almost tender. Add salt and simmer beans until  just tender, about 15 minutes more. Beans may be prepared up to this point  2 days ahead and chilled in cooking liquid, covered. Drain beans in a  colander.    Chop bacon and in a large heavy skillet cook over moderate heat, stirring,  until browned. Add beans, salsa, beer, and salt to taste and cook,  stirring, until most of liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes. Beans may be  made 2 hours ahead and kept at cool room temperature. Reheat beans before  serving.
