Western Kentucky-Style Sauce
Onion powder, Lemon juice, Soy sauce, Brown sugar, Cracked black pepper (up to, Paprika (up to 3), Oregano, Heinz ketchup, Quaker State 10W-30 motor, Black pepper, Chili powder (up to 3), Garlic powder, Lea & Perrins Worcestershire, 
All ingredients above are accurate except for Quaker State motor oil.  Castrol 20W-50 is preferred (gives the sauce more "body"). Just kidding. No  oil. Better when cooked for a while.    Also, I realize that the above sauce violates the norms of purists on the  list who abhor the use of ketchup in a sauce. My apologies to yall. Try it  and youll love it.
