Thai Coffee #2
Strong; black ground coffee, Sugar, Cardamom pods, Evaporated (not condensed), 
Prepare a pot of coffee at a good European strength (Miriam Nadel suggests  2 tablespoons per cup, which Id say is about right).  In the ground  coffee, add 2 or 3 freshly ground cardamom pods. (Ive used green ones, I  imagine the brown ones would give a slightly different flavor.) Sweeten  while hot, then cool quickly.     Serve over ice, with unsweetened evaporated milk (or heavy cream if youre  feeling extra indulgent).  To get the layered effect, place a spoon atop  the coffee and pour the milk carefully into the spoon so that it floats on  the top of the coffee.
