My great aunt Emma gave me this recipe. I use it when I have alot of people  (kids love it) to feed or have to take food to someones house. I cook some  green-beans with garlic, onions and butter or make a garlic salad and you  have a complete meal without to much mess (with the exception of the  chicken). I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we do and do not offend  anyone for I too am not jewish and do not know all the laws regarding  mixing some foods together.    Pre-heat oven to 350    Combine all ingredients and add 1/2 package of the stuffing mix. Mix this  together and place in a sprayed or buttered casserole dish. Top the  casserole with the remaining stuffing.    Place in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for about 30 min. or until bubbly and  topping is crispy and golden brown.
