Phyllo (Pastry)
Baking Powder, Salt, Some water, Flour, 
Sift dry ingredients together. Add water - enough to form a stiff  dough, as in making bread. Cover and set aside for 1/2 hour. Take a  piece of the dough (size of an orange) and roll it out on a lightly  floured board. Be sure your (preferrably) wooden rolling pin is  lightly floured. Roll out in long, smooth strokes, reflouring pin as  necessary. Attempt a translucent look. Set aside the rolled pastry  sheet on a tablecloth. Repeat process. Setting aside each piece  separately. Store covered with a cloth in refigerator. ("Curing" time  is approximately 6 hours and then it willbe ready for use).    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
