Professor Bakers Barbecue Sauce
Cooking oil, Egg, Pepper, white, Cider vinegar, Salt*, Poultry seasoning, 
Beat the egg, then add the oil and beat again. Add other ingredients and  stir. The recipe can be varied to suit individual tastes.    Leftover sauce can be stored in a glass jar in a refrigerator for several  weeks.    NOTES : * Adjust the quantity or eliminate salt to meet individual health  needs and taste. Barbequed chicken basted frequently during cooking will be  saltier than chicken that has been lightly basted.
