Sprinkle with salt and pepper;  set aside. In a skillet, saute onion and celery in butter until soft; stir  in seasonings, bread and broth. Place in cavity of chicken; fold over top  and seal. Place in a small baking pan. Bake at 375F for 45 minutes. Open  foil and bake 5 minutes more or until chicken is tender, juices run clear  and stuffing is lightly browned.    Ive tried something similar to this by making a pocket between the breast  meat and the bone in which to put the stuffing.  This sounds so much easier  and more moist.
