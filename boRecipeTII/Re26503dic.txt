Bacon Supper Snack
Mixed Herbs, Mushrooms; Chopped, Soft White Bread Crumbs, Salt and pepper, Stuffing:, Butter, Egg To Bind; Beaten, Gammon, Tomatoes, 
Melt butter and gently fry mushrooms for 2 minutes. Combine with  breadcrumbs, salt, pepper and herbs. Use just sufficient beaten egg to bind  ~ about 3 tablespoonfuls. Divide stuffing between bacon slices. Roll up and  secure each, if necessary, with a wooden cocktail stick. Cook for 5 minutes  under a hot grill, turning once. Remove sticks and place bacon rolls in an  oven dish, in a single layer. Press tomatoes through a sieve into a  saucepan. Season to taste and bring to the boil. Pour oven bacon rolls and  cook in a very moderate oven (350 F - gas mark 3) for 30 minutes.    Serve with creamed potatoes and, if liked, a tossed green salad.
