Clean, remove skin and debone chicken.  Cut each leg into 4 pieces - 24  tikka in all.    Whisk yoghurt in a large bowl, add the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Rub the chicken pieces with this mixture. Keep aside for 3 1/2 hours.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.    Skewer the marinated tikka at least an inch apart. Keep a tray underneath  to collect the drippings.    Roast in a moderately hot tandoor for 6-7 minutes, basting at least once.  In a charcoal grill, for about the same time, basting once. In a pre-heated  oven, roast the tikka for 8-10 minutes, basting at least twice. Make sure  that the chicken does not touch the sides or the bottom of the oven.
