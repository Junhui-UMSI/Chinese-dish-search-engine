Recipe By     : DAmicos Restaurant Cookbook, 1984    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #269    Date: Mon, 28 Oct 1996 22:23:35 -0800    From: Rooby <rooby@shell.masterpiece.com>    NOTES : When I was newly divorced with two small children and had just  moved back to Seattle from Montana, DAmicos was in the underground    shopping mall downtown called  Rainier Square.  (I think theyre still    there.)  They served fabulous soups, salads, and DESSERTS, so you KNOW I    bought the cookbook when it was published.   This cheesecake is heavenly,    and Ive made it many times through the years.    MC formatted 10/29/96 by rooby@shell.masterpiece.com
