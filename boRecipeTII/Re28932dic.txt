Place onion, bell pepper, and 1/2 cup water in a 3- to 4-quart pan over  high heat. Stir often until pan is dry and onion browns lightly, 10 to 12  minutes.    2. Add curry powder and garlic; stir 1 minute. Add 2 cups water, stirring  well to free browned bits in pan, then add pumpkin, bouillon cubes, and  sugar. Cover and simmer gently to blend flavors, 25 to 30 minutes.    3. Meanwhile, mix a little of the yogurt with the flour until smooth, then  combine with remaining yogurt. When the soup has simmered, with a whisk,  stir yogurt-flour mixture into it. Turn heat to high and stir until  boiling, then simmer and stir about 2 minutes. Ladle into bowls or mugs,  and top with chopped cilantro.    Per serving: 97 cal., 6.5% (6.3 cal.) from fat; 6.2 g protein; 0.7 g fat  (0.2 g sat.); 18 g carbo.; 384 mg sodium; 1.5 mg chol.
