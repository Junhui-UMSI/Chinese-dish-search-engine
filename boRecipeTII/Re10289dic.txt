Plus, its quick to make and easy to vary.    Rub the pat of butter over the prepared crust and bake it in a 350-degree  oven for about 10 minutes. This will make the crust crispy.  Soften the  cream cheese by placing it in a microwave-safe mixing bowl and microwaving  for about 30 seconds, or 15 per package. Mix the sugar into the softened  cream cheese with an electric mixer. Blend the eggs and the rest of the  ingredients into the cream cheese mixture. Pour the mixture into the crust  and bake in a 350-degree oven for 40 minutes or until the center is almost  set. Cool for 10 minutes, then pop it into your fridge to chill for 3 hours  or overnight. This is the ideal -- but Ive made the cheesecake and chilled  it for 1 and a half hours and then brought it to a party, and it tasted  fine.
