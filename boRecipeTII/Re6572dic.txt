Poached Salmon with Lobster Butter
Butter, Reduced lobster stock *, Lemon (juice only), Salt, Whole 7-8 lb. salmon, Green-black lobster brain OR, FOR THE BUTTER, 
*Note: Lobster stock should be made from shells and heads, then heavily  reduced to make 3-4 tablespoons.    Scale, gut and wipe the fish.  Rub the inside cavity with salt. If you have  a fish kettle, steam the salmon whole over boiling water for 30-35 minutes  (making sure the water is kept topped up).  Or wrap the fish in lightly  oiled foil and bake it in the oven for an hour at 325 F (170 C) gas mark 3.  Leave it to rest while you make the butter.    Warm the lemon juice in a small basin over a saucepan of simmering water.  Beat in the nuggets of cold butter, adding more as each one melts. Do this  gently ~ it can split if you overheat it (revive it with a quick splash of  cold water).  When you have an unctuous smooth sauce like thin cream, sieve  and whisk in the green goo from the head of the lobster - which immediately  turns the butter a wonderful orange-pink.    Serve the salmon when it is just cool but still sweet-flavoured and full of  its own juices, with piping hot baked potatoes and warm lobster butter.
