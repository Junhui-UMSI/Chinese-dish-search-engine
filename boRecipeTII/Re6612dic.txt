Pogens Gingersnaps
Butter, Vegetable shortening, Baking soda, Molasses, Brown sugar, All-purpose flour, Ground cinnamon, Ground cloves, Salt, Powdered ginger, Egg, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cream the butter, shortening, brown  sugar, molasses, and egg until light and fluffy. Sift together the dry  ingredients; combine both mixtures. Form the dough into walnut-size  balls. With floured fingers, press the balls into flat circles on an  ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 8 minutes, or until golden brown.  Remove the gingersnaps from the cookie sheet as soon as they are cool  and seal in a covered container to preserve their crunch.
