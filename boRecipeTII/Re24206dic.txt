Preheat oven to 425F. Sift flour, dark brown sugar, baking powder, baking  soda, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg and salt into large bowl. Add dried  currants. Melt 1/4 cup unsalted butter with dark molasses in heavy small  saucepan over low heat. Combine molasses mixture with buttermilk and pour  into dry ingredients. Mix dough until just blended.    Gently knead dough on generously floured surface until smooth, about 20  turns. Divide dough in half. Pat out each dough piece into 5-inch-diameter  round. Cut each dough round into 4 wedges. Transfer dough wedges to  ungreased cookie sheet, spacing 2 inches apart. Brush with melted butter.  Sprinkle with sugar. Bake until scones are just firm to touch, about 20  minutes. Serve scones hot.    Bon Appetit May 1993  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Julie Bertholf <jewel1@ix.netcom.com> on  Feb 21, 1998
