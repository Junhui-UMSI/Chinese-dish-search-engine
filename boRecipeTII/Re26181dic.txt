Tom Kha Gai (Chicken Coconut Soup)
Cilantro leaves, Coconut milk, Fresh kaffir lime leaves, Boned chicken breast, Fish sauce, Lime juice, Green Thai chili peppers, young galangal, lemon grass, Sugar, Black chili paste, 
A rich, aromatic dinner soup, which is enjoyed throughout the meal.  Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their  flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a  knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink shoots.  Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the flavor will not  be quite the same.    Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime  leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling. Add the chicken, fish sauce  and sugar.    Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked . Add the  remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.    Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the soup  into the serving bowl.    Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and serve.
