The next is from Simon Haxter, restaurant manager:    Halve and core potatoes, leaving about 1/2 inch of potato on skin. Place  potatoes in mixing bowl and set potato shells on baking sheet.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In small pan, saute cabbage, onion and garlic  in butter until cabbage is limp and onions taste sweet. Add to reserved  potato whites along with remaining ingredients. Mash until well mixed,  leaving potatoes slightly lumpy. Stuff skins with mixture, leaving a slight  mound.    Bake 3 to 6 minutes or until warmed through and golden on top. Potatoes can  be heated in the microwave by cooking 4 at a time 1 to 1 1/2 minutes on  medium- high power. Garnish with parsley.
