Heat oven to 375F. In large mixer bowl combine all pastry ingredeints. Beat  at low speed, scraping bowl often, until well mixed. Divide dough in half;  flatten each into about a 1/2 inch thick rectangle. Wrap in plastic food  wrap; refrigerate 15 min.    Meanwhile, in small bowl, whisk egg white until foamy; set aside.    On lightly floured surface roll half of dough into 12-by 8-inch rectangle.  Use ruler to gently puch in sides to keep straight. Cut into six 4-inch  squares. In center of each square place 2 tsp. of filling and about 1 tsp  raspberry preserves. Fold one corner of square over to form a triangle.  Lightly brush bottom inside edges with beaten egg white. Pinch together  edges to seal; crimp with fork, if desired. Place on lightly greased cookie  sheets. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Brush tops with remaining  egg white. Carefully prick top in 2 or 3 places with fork. Bake for 20-25  min. or until light golden brown. Cool 10 min.    In small bowl stir together powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon peel and  enough water for glazing consistency; spread or drizzle over turnovers.  Serve warm or cool. Store cooled turnovers in airtight container.
