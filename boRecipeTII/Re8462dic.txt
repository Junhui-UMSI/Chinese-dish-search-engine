This rib-sticking soup makes a fine meal, especially with a salad  alongside.    Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-low heat. Add leeks,  potatoes and onion. Saute until onion is tender, stirring occasionally,  about 12 minutes. Add broth and bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to  medium-low. Simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.  Working in batches, puree 5 cups soup in blender. Return to pot. Season  soup to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Refrigerate  uncovered until cold. Cover; keep refrigerated.)    Preheat oven to 350 deg. F. Stir remaining 1 tablespoon oil and garlic in  small skillet over low heat until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute;  remove from heat and cool. Add cheese to garlic in skillet and toss to  combine. Arrange bread slices on baking sheet. Spoon cheese mixture onto  bread slices, dividing equally. Bake toasts until cheese melts, about 10  minutes.    Bring soup to simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently. Ladle into  bowls. Sprinkle generously with chives. Serve, passing toasts separately.  6 to 8 Servings    Bon Appetit December 1996 Daveena Limonick Los Angeles, California    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Jennie Craig <jecraig@LAN-INC.COM> on Apr 3,  1998
