Lemon Cake
White cake mix, (3 oz.) lemon jello, Water, Eggs, Lemon extract, Vegetable oil, 
Beat all ingredients together at high speed until fluffy. Pour into greased  large loaf pan. (I used a disposable "giant loaf pan) Bake for 1 hour at  325F. While hot, poke lots of holes with a long-tined fork or a skewer ( I  poke all the way to the bottom) and glaze with 1 C. confectioners sugar  mixed with 4 T. lemon juice.
