Torta Della Nonna
Allpurpose flour, Juice and zest of 1 lemon, FILLING, Pine nuts, Vanilla extract, Egg, plus 2 yolks, Sweet butter, Sugar, Eggs, Extra virgin olive oil,, PASTRY, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.    To make the pastry, make a well of the flour, place egg, yolks, sugar,  butter and olive oil mixture in center and proceed as you would with fresh  pasta, i.e. bring flour in bit by bit until liquid inwell is thick enough  to bring together with hands. Knead until dough is smooth and then allow to  rest 10 minutes.    Meanwhile, make the filling by mixing together the ricotta, pine nuts,  sugar, lemon zest, juice and eggs in a bowl until creamy.    To assemble, roll out the pastry to form two 12 inch circles. Place one  circle down to line the bottom and sides of the pan. Spread the ricotta  mixture evenly over this layer. Place the remaining circle of dough over  the top and pinch together the edges. Place in oven and bake for 35 to 40  minutes. Remove and serve warm or at room temperature with vin santo from  Cappezzana.
