This is a recipe for a base curry sauce.  It is not a dish in itself but  requires adding other ingredients to it to finish a particular dish.    Stage 1 Peel and rinse the onions, ginger and garlic. Slice the onions and  roughly chop the ginger and garlic.    Put the chopped ginger and garlic in a blender with about 1/2 a pint of the  water and blend until smooth.    Take a large saucepan and put in the onions, blended garlic and ginger and  the rest of the water.    Add the salt and bring to the boil.  Turn down the heat to very low ans  simmer with the lid on for 40-45 minutes.    LEAVE TO COOL    Stage 2 Once cooled, pour about half of the boiled onion mixture into a  blender and blend until perfectly smooth. (at least 2 minutes). Pour the  blended onion mixture into a clean pan or bowl and repeat with the other  half of the boiled onions.    Wash and dry the saucepan.  Reserve about 4 tablespoons of the sauce at  this stage to use in cooking the meat in your chosen curry.    Stage 3 Pour the can of tomatoes into the rinsed blender and blend until  perfectly smooth (about 2 minutes).    Into the clean saucepan, put the oil, tomato puree, turmeric and paprica.    Add the blended tomatoes and bring to the boil.  Turn down the heat and  cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.    Add the onion mixture to the saucepan and bring to the boil. Turn down the  heat to a simmer.    When froth rises skim this off.    Simmer for  20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally to stop the sauce sticking  to the bottom of the saucepan.    Use immediately or refrigerate for upto 4 days.
