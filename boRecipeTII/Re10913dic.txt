Rabbit Rabble

Mary asked for Irish entrees. Here are several from a lovely book called  Irish Countryhouse Cooking. I know the recipes are vague at times, but you  should manage to figure them out.    Spread jointed rabbit with lots of mustard. Fry small cubes bacon and put  in casserole. Fry jointed rabbit. Place in the casserole and cook at 400  degrees F for 35-40 minutes until tender. Transfer rabbit to a heated  platter. Add sour cream to casserole and heat without boiling, scraping the  juices that adhere to the pan. Season. Serve with steamed potatoes.
