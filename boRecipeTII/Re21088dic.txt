Two Brines for Smoking Fish
Salt, Brown sugar, Water, Water, BRINE #1, Rock salt, Sugar, Plus your choice of Flavorings, BRINE #2, Salt, Plus your choice of Flavorings, 
It is recommended that you rub in flavorings just before putting the fish  into the smoker, although you can also put flavorings into either of the  above brines; in other words you can prepare a brine marinade flavored with  garlic, shallots, tarragon, dill, thyme, or whatever you fancy. After  brining in the flavored brine, fish should washed off and dried before  smoking.    Smoked fish will keep for a solid year, at least if they are frozen in  airtight plastic bags from which the air has been exhaled.
