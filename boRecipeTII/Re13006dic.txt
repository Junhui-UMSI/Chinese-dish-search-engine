Winter Greens Soup - Annie Somerville
Yellow onion; thinly sliced, Fresh Lemon Juice, Carrot; thinly sliced, Vegetable stock, Garlic, Parmesan cheese, Light olive oil, Green chard, Salt and pepper, Chard stems; thinly sliced, Recipe Garlic Croutons, Dry white wine, Potato; thinly sliced, Kale, Spinach, 
Make the stock and keep it warm over low heat.    Wash the kale, remove stems (use in Vegetable Stock). Wash chard remove  stems (use in Vegetable Stock). Wash spinach remove stems.    Heat the olive oil in a soup pot and add the onions, 1/2 tsp. salt and  several pinches of pepper. Saute over medium heat until the onion is soft,  about 5 to 7 minutes. Then add the garlic, chard stems, potatoes, and  carrot. Saute until the vegetables are heated through, about 5 minutes. Add  1/2 c. stock, cover pot, and cook for about 10 minutes. When the vegetables  are tender, add the white wine and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, until the pan  is nearly dry. Stir in the kale, chard, 1 tsp. salt, and a few pinches of  pepper, and 3 cups stock. Add the spinach and cook for 3 to 5 minutes,  until just wilted.    Puree the soup in a blender or food processor until it is smooth. Thin with  a little more stock if it seems too thick. Season with lemon juice and salt  and pepper to taste. Garnish each serving with Garlic Croutons and a  sprinkle of Parmesan.    Makes 9 to 10 cups.    NOTE: " A hearty, nourishing winter soup, with full flavors and a smooth  texture. The kale will take longer to cook than the spinach or chard, so be  sure its tender before you puree the soup. We often vary this recipe by  adding a small handful of French sorrel leaves for their lemony flavor."
