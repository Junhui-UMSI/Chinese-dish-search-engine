Pecan Praline
Pecans; chopped coarse, Sugar, Salt, 
Lightly oil a baking sheet.    In a dry heavy saucepan cook sugar over moderate heat, stirring with a  fork, until melted and cook, without stirring, swirling pan, until a golden  caramel. Stir in pecans with salt until coated well. Immediately pour  mixture onto baking sheet, tilting baking sheet to make a thin layer, and  cool completely, about 20 minutes. Break praline into shards and carefully  remove from the baking sheet. Praline may be made 2 days ahead, kept  between sheets of waxed paper in an airtight container at room temperature.
