Caramelized Onion Soup
Caramelized Onions - Lora, Onion Cooking Liquid, Nonfat Veg Chicken Broth;, salt and pepper, French Bread, Thick Slices; Toasted, Grated Swiss Cheese, 
Note 1: Original recipe used regular chicken, beef or vegetable broth    Loras way: Combine the onions, cooking liquid and broth in a large pot  placed over moderate heat. (I had 2 C of the onion cooking liquid after  cooking them down in the crockpot so I used an extra 1 1/2 C of water).  Stir occasionally as the soup comes to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to  taste (I didnt add any salt or pepper as I didnt think it needed it).  Preheat the broiler to high with the rack in the upper part of the oven.  Select 8 oven proof bowls and place them on a sturdy baking sheet or in a  rimmed roasting pan. Ladle the hot soup into the bowls and top with a slice  of toast. Sprinkle generously with cheese and broil until the cheese melts  and begins to bubble (I didnt use the cheese).    Serve immediately.    This is wonderful!! Fabulous aroma and wonderful rich flavor.
