At any rate there were 3 recipes in an article called Kosher  (In Accordance with the Jewish Dietary Laws) and although I havent tried  them they sounded interesting enough to post to the list. "Cooking Kosher  with Colette Rossant".    1.  Preheat the oven to 375-degrees F.    2.  Brush a baking pan with olive oil. Line the pan with the sliced onions,  celery and carrots.    3.  Rub the fish with the remaining olive oil mixed with the soy sauce.  Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper. Fill the cavity with the herbs and  garlic.    4.  Place the fish on the onions, and top the fish with sliced tomatoes.    5.  Bake the fish for 25 minutes or until it flakes easily with a fork.  Serve with the rhubarb sauce.    Rhubarb Sauce (Serves 4)    1.  Place all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the  heat and simmer until the rhubarb is cooked.    2.  Pour the sauce in a sauceboat and serve with the fish at room  temperature.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 254    From the Jewish Food recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
