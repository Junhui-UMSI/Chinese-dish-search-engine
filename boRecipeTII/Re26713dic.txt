I made this  recipe which Ive posted here before, but I varied it enough to warrant  posting it again.  As a side dish, I made minute rice. I microwaved it in  chicken broth and a small amount of tarragon for 2 minutes. Nice and  simple.  For dessert I made this peach stuff that was somewhat like a  milkshake ("Peach Nutmeg Frappe").  I got it from a "Cooking Light" special  magazine that I picked up today.  I was pleased with both recipes.    * The Polka Dot Palace - The BBS for Homemakers!  1-201-822-3627 * Posted  by LISA on 08-05-95    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #708 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
