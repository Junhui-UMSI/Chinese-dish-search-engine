Tortilla Rolls
chopped green chiles, Salt and pepper, Cheddar cheese, Flour tortillas, Green onions, cream cheese, sour cream, 
Have tortillas at room temperature. With an electric mixer, mix the  remaining ingredients until all are well mixed. Spread fairly thinly and  evenly on tortillas to within 1/8 inch of the edge. Roll up tortillas jelly  roll fashion and wrap each separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate  overnight. When ready to serve, slice in 3/4 inch rounds and arrange on  plate. Serve plain or with salsa on the side.    NOTES : Tortillas will tend to dry out if rolls are unwrapped and cut too  far in advance. Slice just before serving.
