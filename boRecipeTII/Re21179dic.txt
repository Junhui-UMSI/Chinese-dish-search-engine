Salt, Cucumber, Garlic, Yogurt, 
Line a sieve with cheese cloth and put the yogurt in it, over a bowl,  wrapped in the cloth, in a fridge, for several hours. Discard the whey  juices and wring as much liquid out of the cheese-cloth-wrapped yogurt as  possible. Mince fresh garlic and blend into a paste with a little of the  yogurt. Combine this with the rest of the yogurt and put it in the fridge  (covered) overnight. Peel the cucumber and slice thinly. Put a layer of  cucumber in a bowl, sprinkle salt generously all over; repeat layers of  cucumber slices and salt, ending with salt. Allow to sit at least an hour.  Remove cucumbers to a strainer (discard the liquid the salt forced out) and  rinse very very well, tossing the cucumbers under running water. Squeeze as  much water out of the cukes as you can, pat them dry, then chop them finely  or put them in a blender briefly, or force them through a strainer. Combine  with yogurt. Cool in fridge for several hours.  NOTES : This makes a little sauce. If it turns out you like the stuff, its  easy to double or -- for a party -- triple it.
