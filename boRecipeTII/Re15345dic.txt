It can be used for a sandwich or cracker spread or  a dip with veggies. I made a double batch, so that there would be extra,  and Im glad that I did! After I mixed it up, I thought that it needed a  little punch, so I added some minced garlic. Im bad about adding garlic to  everything that I can.    In a food processor, cimbine beans, parsley, chives, dill, salt, pepper,  cheese and lemon juice; process until smooth.  Spread mixture on 4 slices  of bread; top with cucumber, lettuce and sprouts. Top with remaining bread.    Makes 4 sandwiches.

The fat is incorrect,  because I substituted nonfat cream cheese for the low-fat cream cheese or  goat cheese that it origionally called for.
