Wholegrain Waffles
Pancake/Waffle Mix, Water, Arrowhead Mills Multigrain, 
I pulse this a few times in a blender, and lo! Perfect waffle batter. Dont  need eggs, oil, milk, baking poweder or nuthin else. Before pouring each  waffle, I spray the waffle iron (the inside!) with a product called El  Molino Canola-Mist (by the way, they have it with olive oil too). Then I  wait until the light on the iron (a Toastmaster Kool-Touch) goes out, but  more importantly, until the waffle has almost stopped steaming. Voila,  perfect waffles every time. They are light, crisp, golden brown.    Such a waffle is the heavenly foundation for not only the usual traditional  toppings (The IHOP Parade), but for anything you think tastes good slopped  over toast or pasta.
