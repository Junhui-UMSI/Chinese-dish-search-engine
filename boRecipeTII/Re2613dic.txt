Peanut Braid
Recipe Basic Sweet Dough or, Planters Creamy Peanut, Chopped Planters cocktail, 
I think this might be the recipe youre looking for. I found it in The  Fleischmann Treasury of Yeast Baking from 1962. Email me back to let me  know you got this.    (Makes 2 braids)    Prepare dough. When ready to shape, combine Planters Creamy Peanut Butter  and Fleischmanns Margarine. Mix until well blended.    Punch down dough. Divide in half. Cut each half into 3 pieces. Roll each  piece into a 14 x 3 inch strip. Spread peanut butter-margarine mixture down  center of strips. Bring edges to center and pinch to seal. Form three  strips into a braid, sealing ends well. Repeat with remaining three strips.  Place on greased baking sheets. Cover;let rise in warm place, free from  draft, until doubled in bulk, about one hour.    Bake in moderate oven (375 degrees F.) about 20 minutes. Cool. Frost with  confectioners sugar frosting and sprinkle with chopped peanuts if desired.  Posted to Digest bread-bakers.v097.n029 by Rose4May@aol.com on Apr 1, 1997
