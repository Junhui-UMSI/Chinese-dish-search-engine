Asparagus Salad with Raspberry Vinegrette
Fresh asparagus, Sugar, Parsley, Red onion, Water, Red pepper, Raspberry vinegar, 
Steam the asparagus pieces for 2 minutes.  Plunge into cold water to stop  cooking.  Drain.    Put asparagus, red pepper and onion into a plastic bowl (with cover). Blend  vinegar, water, sugar (honey) and parsley in a separate bowl and then pour  over vegetables.  Adjust seasonings if desired (may want to add more  sweetness).  Stir, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Stir every  so often.    Serve cold as a side salad.    Hint:  make sure you only use the tender part of the asparagus.  My mom  taught me that you hold the tip and base of the asparagus in separate hands  and then bend it until it breaks.  Only use the tip end and use the base  end for soup or compost it.
