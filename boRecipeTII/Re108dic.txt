Kim Chi
Soy sauce, chinese cabbage, Salt, Cayenne pepper, spring onions, red chili peppers, Fresh ginger root, Dashi, 
Cut base off cabbage, then slice lengthwise into 6 segments. Dry in the sun  for half a day, cut each segment in halves crossways, then put into an  unglazed earthenware pot alternately with good handfuls of salt and a  sprinkling of cayenne pepper, making several layers. Cover with a wooden  lid just small enough to fit inside the pot so that it rests directly on  the cabbage. Weight it down with a heavy stone and leave for a week, then  rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold running water. Squeeze out as much  moisture as possible. Slice into 2.5 cm (1 inch) sections or chop more  finely if preferred and put into the rinsed-out jar, this time layering  with the onions, garlic, chilies, and ginger. Fill pot with the Dashi stock  mixed with the soy and MSG. Cover with wax paper, put lid back on top and  refrigerate. After 4 or 5 days the kim chi is ready for eating. Serve with  hot white rice and a dash of soy sauce. Note: in cold weather kim chi does  not require refrigeration, but when weather is warm, store in refrigerator  for up to 3 weeks.
