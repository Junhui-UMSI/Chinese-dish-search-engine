Pinto Bean Cakes with Salsa
Yellow cornmeal, Garlic, Onion, Fresh Cilantro, Red bell pepper, Tomato-based salsa, Salad oil, Fresh jalapeno chili, Ground cumin, Pepper, Pinto beans (15 oz each), Cooking spray (optional), Liquid smoke, 
In a 12- to 14-inch nonstick frying pan over medium heat, combine 1 1/2  teaspoons of the oil with the onion, bell pepper, garlic and chili. Stir  often until onion is limp but not browned, about 5 minutes. In a bowl,  coarsely mash beans with a potato masher until they stick together. Stir in  onion mixture, liquid smoke, cilantro, cumin, and pepper, mixing well.  Spread cornmeal on a sheet of waxed paper.  When bean mixture is cool to  touch, divide into 8 equal portions, shaping each into a 1/2-inch thick  cake. Coat cakes with cornmeal. Return the frying pan to medium-high heat.  Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. When oil is hot, add cakes and brown  lightly, 8 to 10 minutes; turn cakes over once. Coat pan with cooking oil  spray if cakes start to stick. Serve cakes with salsa to add to taste.
