Place curry powder in a wide frying pan and stir over medium heat until  slightly darker in color (3-4 minutes). Add apple, yellow onion, lemon  juice, mushrooms, bouillon, and 1 1/2 C. of the apple juice; bring to a  boil.    Rinse chicken and pat dry; add to pan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until  meat near bone is no longer pink; cut to test (about 30 minutes). Lift  chicken from pan; arrange on a warm platter. Keep warm.    Blend flour and remaining 1/2 C. apple juice. Gradually add to sauce in  pan, stirring; increase heat to high and cook, stirring until sauce is  thickened. Pour over chicken. The sauce also tastes good poured over baked  potato or rice. 305 calories 7g fat    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #78    From the MealMaster recipe list.
