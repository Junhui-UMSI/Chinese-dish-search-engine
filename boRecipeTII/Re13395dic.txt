Yankee Tomato Chutney
Cider vinegar, Salt, Fresh Ginger, Brown Sugar, Granulated sugar, Tomatoes, Chili Peppers, Garlic, 
** Use canned chilis if preferred. Combine sugars, vinegar, ginger, garlic  and salt in a large non-reactive sauce pan and cook over low heat, stirring  occasionally, for 15 minutes. Peel, seed and coarsely chop the tomatoes.  Add them and the peppers to vinegar mixture and simmer over low heat,  stirring occasionally until tomatoes are translucent but sitll chunky and  there is just a bit of thick syrup around them, about 1 1/2 hours. If there  is sitll too much liquid when tomatoes are done, strain into a separate pan  and boil to a thick syrup before recombining with the solids. Makes 2  pints.    NOTES : Works as a dip with vegetables or crackers or along side roast  meats and poultry. It keeps in the refrigerator for months, an important  quality for Nancy, who no longer does any canning.
