This soup I like to prepare when I have guest for dinner,I can prepare it 2  days before. It is very colourful which gives a festive atmosphere.    Source: From my mother with love& more. Family recipe.    Note: When I write optional I mean that for my self I prefer to cut some  calories, But when you have guests ,forget about calories.    In a saucepan melt butter and add onion. saute.    In the food processor.....(How did we manage with out the food  processor?)...shred grossly (if you have the Chips disc is great) and all  the peeled and washed vegetable.    Add to the onion and butter ,mix and let saute for couple of minuets  covered.    Add the chicken soup, bring to boil, Taste, add pepper and salt if needed.  Cover and cook on small fire for 45 minutes.    Note: It is better not to add too much chicken soup because the soup should  be like cream, you can always add after .    I use hand blender that I can put in the saucepan, and I puree it.    Just before I serve I bring soup to a boil, add the cream stir well. Keep  an eye not to let soup to re boil Just to heat it well. Swich fire off, and  serve.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #322 by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net>  on Dec 09, 1997
