Basic Bread Dough
Sugar, Warm water, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, High gluten flour, Yeast; (dry), Salt, 
Place warm water in a warm mixing bowl and add yeast. Stir to dissolve and  let stand 3 minutes. Add salt and sugar and stir through. Add flour and  olive oil and mix, using hands until you can knead the dough without it  sticking to your fingers.    Wash and dry hands and remove ball to cutting board. Knead the dough,  occasionally dusting with 1 teaspoon flour, until a firm, smooth homogenous  ball is formed, about 15 minutes. Place ball of dough in a lightly oiled  mixing bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise in a warm  place until its size is doubled, about 2 hours. Punch down and divide into  4 pieces. Dough is now ready for use.
