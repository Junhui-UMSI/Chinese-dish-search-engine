Busias Pierogi
milk, Butter, Flour, Eggs, Salt to taste, 
You can bake them (after boiling them) or fry them & top with fried onions  & sour cream ... or eat them plain ... or put them in soup like kreplach.    Bring milk and butter almost to a boil: Add flour to make a paste  consistency. Beat 2 eggs, add flour and salt to make paste. Combine both  mixtures. Keep adding flour until it doesnt stick to your hands. Roll out  to 1/4" thickness. Cut and fill with filling of your choice (sauerkraut,  mashed potatoes with cheese, cherries). Pinch together. Boil.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Linda Shapiro <lss@coconet.com> on Oct 05,  1998,
