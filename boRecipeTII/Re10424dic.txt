milk, Semi-sweet chocolate, Salt, (1 stick) butter, softened, Water, Pecans, Sugar, Shredded coconut, Baking Powder, Dark brown sugar, Flour, Vanilla, Egg, 
Preheat oven to 350.    Melt 4 TB. butter in small saucepan.  Remove from heat, stir in brown  sugar, cocnut, pecans, chocolate morsels, and milk. Blend well. Spread  mixture evenly in bottom of 9" round cake pan. Set aside.    Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in mixing bowl.  Add  remaining butter, vanilla, water, and egg.  Beat bater until smoothe.  Pour  over coconut-pecan mxture in pan and bake for about 30 minutes or until  toothpick comes out clean.  Cool 5 minutes -- turn out on plate.    The way I remember it, this cake had some cocoa in it as well.  It would  certainly lend itself well to that  -- sort of a German Chocolate thing.  Id try 1/2 C. cocoa.    I think this recipe originally came from Fanny Farmer, but a friend of mine  made it and wrote it out for me.
