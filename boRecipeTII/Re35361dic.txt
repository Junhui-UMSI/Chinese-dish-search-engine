Beef Burittos
Jalapenos; (chopped), you, Chopped tomatoes with, Stew meat with some fat;, Sweet onion, Tortillas, 
place first four ingredients in crock pot and cook on low for at least 6-7  hours.    place meat in tortillas and roll into burritos, then wrap individually in  foil. Make sure to get some juice in the buritto. Heat oven to 350 degrees  and bake 10 minutes. This is the trick because the juice soaks into the  buritto.    I have also used pork and chicken in these and they are great, but make  sure to use chicken with skin so it isnt dry. I have also substituted  salsa verde for the tomatoes when using the pork for an easy chili verde  burrito. Try these they are really good,    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Rebekah_Frye@fwpa.com (Rebekah Frye) on Feb  2, 1998
