Baked Pineapple
Lime; cut into quarters, Cayenne pepper; or to taste, Ripe pineapple, Parsley; finely chopped, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut off the very top of the pineapple and  place it in a roasting pan. Roast the whole pineapple for about 1 hour,  then remove from the oven and, as soon as it is cool enough to handle, cut  it first into 8 thick rounds, crosswise. Cut these slices in half and  arrange on a platter. Squeeze the lime juice over the pineapple, dust with  cayenne pepper, and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. (Pineapple will  dry out if it is not roasted whole. Diners should pick up the halfrounds of  pineapple with their hands and nibble the tender flesh from the inside of  the rind.)
