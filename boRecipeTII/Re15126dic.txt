Wheat Beer 3
(from a previous batch), Honey, Tetnanger (alpha 3.6) boil 1, Wheat/Malt extract, Crystal, Hr, Tetnanger to finish 2 min, WYeast Bavarian Wheat, 
Cooled overnight outside, rack and repitch slurry from previous batch. This  ones a little lighter, I was expecting a big difference in the  hop taste  and aroma but the difference was very slight. Maybe there were too many  fermentables to let the hop taste through. Both brews have a  good kick  (sorry  about  the lack of gravities but I  brewed  during  finals week.)
