Source: A Small Pamphlet from Western Beet Sugar Producers, Inc. Portions:  About 6 pints    Pickles: Wash vegetables, peel onions and garlic; remove any blemishes,  seeds and cores from green pepper. Thinly slice cucumbers and onions. Mince  green pepper. Combine pickle ingredients; cover with cold water and 2 trays  of ice cubes. The recipe suggests you let stand for 2 hours, I prefer to  let them stand overnight with lots of ice cubes.    Syrup: Remove the garlic from the pickles. Drain well. In a kettle, mix  syrup ingredients, add pickles, onions, and peppers; stir well. Bring just  to a boil on high heat. Remove from heat and pack into hot, sterilized  jars, cover with syrup; work out any bubbles, seal at once. Everytime I  make these I argue with myself if I should boil them in a canner and I  usually do but this recipe was published before the days of samonella and  fears of other bacteria. It sounds like a lot of work but if you dont plan  any other intense project it really isnt. Give thanks for being able to do  the slicing in a food processor. For many years I did it by hand and  usually tried to make a triple batch. Hamburgers were never complete  without the pickles. As close as I can tell this pamphlet was published in  1956. Hope you try and enjoy, even 1/2 recipe is fun.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Jerome & Jean Emer <j.emer@megsinet.net> on  Sep 25, 1998,
