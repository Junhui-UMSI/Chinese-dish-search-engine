Start by making rice: Boil water in sauce pan and add rice, put on very low  simmer for 25 minutes. Try to leave cover on for entire period of time. Use  a timer.    Saute tomatoes, onions, peppers and chopped veggie hot dogs in a pan,  sprinkle with paprika. Dont over-cook and make everything soggy. Add  choices of spices and peppers if you like the recipe hot and spicy. No pan  spray should be necessary if you keep the heat low.    Heat up black beans in microwave, remove excess water so it isnt runny.    Bring the water to boil in a sauce pan and add the yeast. Lower flame  immediately and stir until well mixed. Add additional water to make the  "cheese" sauce pour easily. Do this as the last step.    Serve: Wrap saute in tortillas on plate, serve beans and rice on the side  and allow every diner to put the cheese sauce where they want it. This  entire recipe takes just about as long as it takes to cook the rice. Dont  use BREWERS yeast. Use Nutritional yeast which has a distinct yellow  color--best of all, use Dixie Diners Cheese NOT. Its very tasty. Like  most Mexican style recipes, there are a million ways to modify this. But if  you are tired and in a hurry and have unexpected guests, this one works  with very little time and trouble for almost any number of diners. For  college students it is also very cheap.
