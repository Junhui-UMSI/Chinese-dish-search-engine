Bbq Brust Deckle
Bottle BBQ sauce; (18 oz), Wine, Cumin, 
Third, My very own recipe for BBQ Brust Deckle (your kosher butcher knows)    Prepare 2-3 days before serving:    1 Brust deckle - Sprinkle meat with ground cumin and let stand for about 15  min.    Cook meat on grill or under low-temp broiler 20-25 min each side - meat  should not be cooked through.    Remove from heat and let stand on cutting board till cool enough to handle.  Slice thin, across the grain, and arrange in large pyrex baking dish. Into  large mixing bowl, pour 1 18oz bottle BBQ sauce, then "wash" the sauce  bottle with equal amount of wine (semi-dry to dry, your choice) and mix  with BBQ sauce.    Pour over sliced meat, cover tightly with foil and refrigerate for a couple  of days.    About 2 hours before serving, place in 200degree oven.Remove and serve.  Fantastic, if I say so myself.
