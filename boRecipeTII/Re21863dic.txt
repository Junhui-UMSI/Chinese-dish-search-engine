(From Taste of Home Oct./Nov. 1996 by Denise Goedeken Platte Center,  Nebraska).  This recipe was shown served with roasted goose...however Im  going to make it with turkey.    In a skillet, saute the celery and onion in butter; transfer to a large  bowl. Add the apples, raisins, bread, sugar and salt. In a small bowl, beat  eggs, cider and water. Pour over bread mixture and toss lightly. Stuff your  turkey (says goose 10-12 pounds).
