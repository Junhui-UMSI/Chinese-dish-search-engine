Pimento Cheese
Sugar, Vinegar, Water, Pimentos (chopped), Egg, Cheddar cheese (grated), 
In small saucepan, beat egg and sugar until well blended.  Stir in vinegar  and water.  Cook over low heat until thick.  Set aside until cool. In  medium bowl, mix together cheese, pimentos and sauce. Chill until ready to  use.    Serves 4    From Jeff Murphy:    This is my mothers recipe.    She ground a jar of pimentos first, then maybe half a thing of Velveeta  (you do all this to taste - youre a cook: make it taste good) to push the  remaining pimentos through the grinder; added a fair amount of mayonnaise,  a teaspoon of prepared mustard, salt, and lots of pepper. Stirred it up,  spread it on a single piece of bread folded over (I dont know why that  tasted better; maybe it was because *she* made it) - although today I would  serve it open-faced, leave out the salt, and add some green salad olives on  top.
