Whammo! Hot Sauce
Vinegar, Sugar, Canned tomatoes, Chopped chilli peppers, Mixed pickling spice, Onion, 
by Terry Berke    Tie spices inside a cheesecloth bag. Put vegetables, spices, and vinegar in  a kettle and cook until soft. Press through a sieve or strainer. Add sugar  and cook until desired thickness is reached, stirring frequently to prevent  burning. Pour into sterilized jars and refrigerate until use. At first, the  spices make you think you are eating a pickle, and then WHAMMO! the heat  from the chillies kicks in.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #163 by  on
