Whole Wheat Pasta (Ff)
Whole wheat (NOT graham), Water, Egg whites -or-, 
JoAnne, you bet your bippy those extruders will crank out whole wheat flour  pasta. In fact, it will do so better than semolina!    You may need to expriment a bit with the proportions but Ive had pretty  good luck doing one of the following:    I "cheat" a bit by running the dough through a food processor first. In a  matter of moments you can see the pea-sized dough form.    You can, of course, just use your machine to mix. Its a tad slower, but  when were talking about great-tasting pasta whats a few extra moments?    You will find that the WW will extrude faster than the semolina because  there is nothing but whole wheat and moisture.    If youre going to dry the pasta for later use make sure to dry it well,  else just cook it up (cooks up very quickly).    WARNING: If you use egg whites, be prepared to have a sudden foaming (from  the eggs cooking out of the pasta?)    Varieties: Add some freshly cracked pepper and finely chopped basil or  maybe a little oregano into the pasta dough.    One of my favorites is to really do a number on some sun-ripened tomatoes  (I run it through a small food processor to get it as finely chopped as  possible) and add some of that incredible flavor along with a few pinches  of oregano.    Sona bona (so GOOD).    Oh, make sure that you soak your die in very hot water and ignore the  advice about spraying it with oil. Ive never found it necessary, but the  soaking? You bet!
