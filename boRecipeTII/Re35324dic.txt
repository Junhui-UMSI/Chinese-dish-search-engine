Salt & pepper brisket as desired. Place in baking dish that has a cover.  Arrange onion slices on top of brisket. In a medium-sized bowl, blend chili  sauce, brown sugar & beer. Add garlic. Pour this over the brisket & onions.  Cover & bake at 350 for 2-1/2 hours. Remove from oven & thicken gravy by  adding cornstarch dissolved in hot water. Bake uncovered an additional 30  minutes. (This makes a delicious gravy which is excellent served over  rice.)    MONTIE MC CARLEY    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.
