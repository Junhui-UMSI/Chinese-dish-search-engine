Swedish Apple Pie (Ovo)
Flour, Egg whites, Vanilla, Finely chopped apple, Walnuts, Baking Powder, To 1 1/2 cups sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, mix first ingredients; the  mixture will be thick.  Stir in chopped apple.  Spray a pie pan with no  stick spray.  Put mixture in the pan and bake for about 35 minutes.    I never use the nuts and it still tastes great.  I never use more than one  cup on sugar - depends on the sweetness of the apples I use.  I especially  like to use Fuji apples.  Before baking I sprinkle the top of the batter  with a touch of cinnamon sugar.  We enjoy this warm but it is ok cold too!
