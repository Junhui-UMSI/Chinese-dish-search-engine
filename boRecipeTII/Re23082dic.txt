Remove  from heat, stir in liqueur and chocolate, and return to low heat.  Stir  until chocolate melts.    2. Whisk in softened butter.  When mixture is smooth, pour into a shallow  bowl and refrigerate until firm, about 40 minutes.    3. Scoop chocolate up with a teaspoon and shape into rough 1-inch balls.  (Perhaps a melon ball (?) or a small ice cream scoop may be useful???) Roll  the truffle balls in the unsweetened cocoa.    4. Store truffles, covered, in the refrigerator.  Let truffles stand at  room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
