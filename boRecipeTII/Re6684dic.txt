Polenta with Arugula Sauce
Garlic, Kosher salt, Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated, Arugula leaves, cleaned and, Soft Polenta, Heavy cream, hot, Black pepper in a mill, 
Cook the polenta and when it is nearly ready, place the garlic, salt, and 2  1/2 cups arugula in a food processor or blender and pulse until it is  evenly chopped. Add half the cream and process until it is well blended.  Add the remaining cream, pulse just enough to mix, transfer the sauce to a  small warm bowl, and stir in the grated cheese. Keep the sauce warm.    Pour the polenta onto individual serving plates-low soup plates are  ideal-and spoon the sauce over each portion. Quickly slice the reserved  arugula into thin strips and scatter over the surface. Add several turns of  black pepper and serve immediately.    Yield: 4 to 6 servings    NOTES : Cooking Live Recipe by: Cooking LIve Show #CL8811    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #460 by Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net>  on Jan 31, 1997.
