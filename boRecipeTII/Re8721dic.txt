In the top of a double boiler, combine all the ingredients except the  cornstarch.  Heat over simmering water until the ingredients are warm to  the touch. Stir continuously during heating. As the sugar dissolves, it may  form a crust.    Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature.  Break the crust and rub  the mixture between your fingers so that it returns to granular form.  Add  the cornstarch and stir.    Use immediately or store in a tightly covered glass container in a cool,  dark place for several months.
