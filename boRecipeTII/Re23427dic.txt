Combine the olive oil, garlic, cilantro and 1 teaspoon each of the salt and  pepper in a blender. Puree until smooth. In a large bowl, mix together the  turkey or chicken, egg and cilantro paste. Add the bread crumbs and mix  only until combined. Roll into small walnut-sized meatballs in the palms of  your hands and place on a tray in the refrigerator. Heat 2 tablespoons of  the vegetable oil in a large stockpot over high heat. Saute the leeks and  carrots with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper for 2  to 4 minutes. Add the cabbage, jalapenos and tomatoes and cook, stirring  frequently, until the vegetables are limp, about 3 minutes longer. Pour in  the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered,  15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a medium skillet over  medium-high heat until nearly smoking. Add the chilled meatballs in  batches, shaking the pan to prevent sticking, and brown on all sides.  Transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. When all the  meatballs are browned, transfer to the simmering stock and cook an  additional 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and serve hot. Yield: 6  servings Variation: For a heartier dish, add a handful or two of rice or  small-shaped pasta along with the stock.
