Ada French Sponge Cookies
Baking Powder, Eggs, Salt, Almond extract, Sugar, Cake Flour, Vanilla extract, 
Preheat OVEN TO 350 f. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat  egg yolks in a small bowl, rapidly, until very thick and lemon colored,  adding almond and vanilla flavorings during the beating.    With clean beaters, beat the egg whites until stiff and shiny; begin to add  sugar, not more than 1 Tablespoon at a time, and beat constantly. Continue  to beat rapidly until whites are very stiff and glossy. Gently fold in the  beaten egg yolks. In the same manner fold in the dry ingredients until well  mixed. Using a small spatula and a measuring tablespoon, measure and droop  onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake for 10 minutes  until light and golden brown. Remove at once from sheet to cool.    one serving = 4 cookies = 1 bread exchange CHO 11, PRO 2, FAT 2, CAL 67, Na  94    Posted by PHILLIP BOWER, Prodigy ID# FHMN87A.
