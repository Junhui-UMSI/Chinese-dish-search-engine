Tart Apple Brown Betty
Margarine -- melted, Apple juice, Apple slices -- tart, Bread crumbs, Ground nutmeg, Lemon -- juice and peel, Brown sugar, 
* Use whole grain bread to make the crumbs. Substitute 1-2 tablespoons  wheat germ for equal amount of crumbs if preferred.    1. Prepare apples: peel, core and slice thinly to equal 4 cups. Use Granny  Smith or other tart apples. 2. Grate the rind of 1/2 of the lemon, being  careful not to include any of the pith just below the peel. Juice half the  lemon, or all if it is a small lemon. 3. Mix bread crumbs with melted  margarine and blend. 4. Mix sugar with nutmeg, lemon peel and juice; blend.  5. Grease a casserole dish with margarine. Put a layer of crumbs on bottom,  spread half the apples atop then half the sugar mixture. Put the rest of  the apples, then the sugar and top with remaining crumbs. Add 1/2 cup very  hot apple juice or water. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 40 minutes  or until done. Cover loosely with foil tent for first 20 minutes to prevent  crumbs browning too quickly.
