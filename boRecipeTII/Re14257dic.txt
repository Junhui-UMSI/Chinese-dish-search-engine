Soda bread only takes 2 to 3 minutes to make and 20 to 30 minutes to bake.  It is certainly another of my great ?convertibles.? We have had the  greatest fun experimenting with different variations and uses. This kind of  bread is also great with olives, sun-dried tomatoes or caramelized onions  added, so the possibilities are endless for the hitherto humble soda bread.    Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.    Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl and make a well in the center. Pour in  most of the milk at once. Using one hand, mix in the flour from the sides  of the bowl, adding more milk if necessary. The dough should be softish,  not too wet and sticky. When it all comes together, turn it out onto a  floured board and knead lightly for a second, just enough to tidy it up.  Pat the dough into a round about 1 inch thick and cut a cross on it to let  the fairies out! Let the cuts go over the sides of the bread to make sure  of this. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then turn the  temperature down to 400 degrees F and continue baking for 15 minutes or  until cooked. If you are in doubt, tap the base of the bread; if it is  cooked, it will sound hollow.    For White Soda Bread with Herbs: Add the freshly chopped herbs to the dry  ingredients. Shape into a loaf or scones and bake.    Yield: 1 big loaf    MC formatted & Busted by Barb at Possum Kingdom on 3/17/98    NOTES : Airdate: 3/17/98: St. Patricks Day Specialties, classic Irish  dishes    Recipe by: Darina Allens Ballymaloe Seasons    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "abprice@wf.net" <abprice@wf.net> on Mar 17,  1998
