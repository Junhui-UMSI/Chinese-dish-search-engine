Soak beans four to eight hours. Cover with water in saucepan and bring  beans to a boil. Simmer 30 - 40 minutes. Heat oil, saute onion and garlic  until soft.  Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, paprika and  cooked, drained, beans.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer 8 - 10  minutes. Add Coriander leaves. Pre-heat oven to 325 F. Combine cottage  cheese,  mozzarella and egg. In a greased lasagna pan place a layer of  noodles, a layer of bean mixture and a layer of cheese mixture. Continue,  alternating noodles, beans and cheese, finishing with a layer of cheese on  top.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top layer. Bake for 40 minutes at 325  F. * I use a mixture of red, pink, baby lima, white, black-eyed and mung in  whatever proportion strikes my fancy.
