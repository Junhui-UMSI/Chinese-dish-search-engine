Veal Scaloppine with Marsala
Marsala wine, olive oil, Salt, Flour, Scallopine of veal, Butter, Black Pepper, 
Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring ab. 3  in. by 3 in or slightly larger. Place them between sheets of wax paper and  pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of a heavy skillet,  pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dip the meat into  flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy skillet, heat the butter and  oil and when it is very hot but not brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook  over relatively high heat until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook  until golden brown on the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min.  Transfer meat to a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the  skillet add the wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce  wine slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these  amts. may be increased to serve more people. For Chicken marsala, I dont  see why you cant substitute chicken breasts.
