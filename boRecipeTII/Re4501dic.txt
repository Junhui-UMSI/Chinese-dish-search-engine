Pesto Stuffed Mushrooms
horseradish, Fresh mushrooms, Italian bread crumbs, Pimentos, Pesto, 
Wash and stem the mushrooms and allow to dry.  Combine bread crumbs  and pesto; mix well.  Add horseradish and blend thoroughly.  Pack  each mushroom cap, mounding with the pesto mixture.    If serving cold, lay a small piece of pimento across top for color,  and serve.  If youd like to serve them hot, omit the pimento; place  in a 350F oven and bake for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately.    Karen Kaleta-Johnson/Franklin, "The Kitchen Table: Where Herbs &  Spices Make a Difference" column in "The Herb Companion." June/July  1992.  Posted by Cathy Harned.
