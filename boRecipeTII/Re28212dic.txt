Clean fish and lay in a baking dish.  Pour Italian dressing over top of  fish.  (As much as you like).  Sprinkle bread crumbs over fish.  (I  sprinkled Old bay seasoning over bread crumbs). Marinate for half-hour.  Bake at 450 degrees for 20 minutes.    EAT-L DIGEST 10 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
