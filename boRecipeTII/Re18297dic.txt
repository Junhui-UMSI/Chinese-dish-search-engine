Veranecki (Pillows)
Egg, Flour, Salt, Baking Powder, Salt, Dry cottage cheese sm curd, 8 oz. glasses COLD water, 
Add enough water to make a soft noodle like dough. Knead until well mixed.  Divide dough into 2 balls. Set one aside. Roll into large circle about 1/8/  inch thick. Cut into 3 inch squares. Fill with the following.    Mix together well.    When filling "Pillows", make sure you place 1 tsp of cottage cheese mixture  in dead center of dough square being VERY careful you dont get any cheese  on the edge. Youll NEVER get the little suckers to seal!!! Any way, they  should come out looking like little pillows. Pinch edges closed with your  fingers. Another tip...dont roll the dough out TOO thin or else you will  get lots of leaks.    Boil pillow in large kettle to which a tsp of salt has been added. It would  be a good idea to not cook more than 5 or 6 at a time lest they stick  together on the kettle. The pillows will be done when they rise to the top  and puff up.  They also take on a yellowish cast (about 7 mins. per batch).  Remove from pot with a slotted spoon very carefully!!! Place them in a bowl  with a stick of butter (dont even attempt this recipe if you try to use  low fat healthy junk!!!). Serve hot with salt and pepper to taste.    Another variation is to fill with black cherries. Cook and butter as with  the cottage cheese pillows. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.
