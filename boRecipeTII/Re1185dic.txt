Creamy Smooth Ice "Cream"
Non fat yogurt; ( I used, Instant no sugar pudding, (small) pineapple tidbits in, Cinnamon, Ginger, 
Id like to pass along a favorite of mine you also might enjoy. This recipe  does include non fat yogurt so not totally vegan.    in a blender, or a large bowl using a hand beater, mix yogurt and fruit  gently. add pudding mix and spices and blend well. Place in a tightly  closed plastic container and freeze until firm.    This is a very easily adaptable recipe. Any flavor combination you crave (  i.e chocolate pudding mix, cappicno yogurt and banana slices )    Posted to fatfree digest by "Ross, Lynne" <Lynne.Ross@Den.Galileo.com> on  Oct 23, 1998,
