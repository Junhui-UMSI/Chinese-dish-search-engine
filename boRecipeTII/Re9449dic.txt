Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, soda, salt, and cloves. Stir  in eggs, pumpkin, and cooking oil till thoroughly combined.  Spread batter  into an ungreased 15x10x1 in baking pan.    Bake at 350F for 25 to 30 min or till a toothpick inserted near the center  comes out clean.  Cool on wire rack.  Frost with Cream Cheese Frosting. Cut  into bars.  Makes 48 bars.    Cream Cheese Frosting: In a bowl beat together cream cheese, margarine or  butter, and vanilla till light and fluffy.  Gradually add 2 cups powdered  sugar, beating well.    Gradually beat in enough remaining powdered sugar to make frosting of  spreading consistency.    [Note:  the cookbook recommends using a half a recipe for the frosting, but  I used a whole one and no one seemed to complain!]    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
