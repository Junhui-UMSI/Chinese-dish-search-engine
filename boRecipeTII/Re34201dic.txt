Bay Scallops with Spinach and Garlic
olive oil, Fresh spinach, Fresh Lemon Juice, garlic, White wine, lemon zest, Kosher salt, pepper, Bay scallops, 
Glens note: The spinach originally said "2 pounds Fresh spinach, stemmed  and but not dried" Guess the missing word probably is "washed".    1. Heat 1 teaspoon on oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic  and lemon zest and cook, stirring constantly, for 20 seconds. Add the  spinach and toss from time to time until wilted. Drain off the liquid and  season with 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper. Keep Warm.    2. Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add  the scallops and saute until just cooked through, about 1 minute. remove  the scallops from the pan and add the lemon juice and wine. Cook, scraping  the bottom of the pan, for 15 seconds. 3.Remove from heat, toss in the  scallops and season with the remaining salt and pepper to taste. Place a  mound of spinach in the center of 4 plates and surround with scallops.  Serve immediately. Serves 4.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #929 by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on  Nov 28, 1997
