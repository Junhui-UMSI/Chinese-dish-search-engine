Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large skillet, cook the bacon until limp  and some of the fat is rendered. Remove the bacon from the skillet, leaving  about 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet. Add the onion and bell pepper  to the drippings and cook over medium heat until just softened, about 3  minutes. Raise the heat to medium high, add the potato and cook, stirring  often, until the vegetables are just golden, about 5 minutes.    In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to gently but thoroughly combine the  turkey, bread crumbs, peas, parsley, tarragon, paprika, salt, pepper, eggs,  and cooked vegetables.    Pat the mixture into a shallow 2 quart baking pan. Lay the partially cooked  bacon slices over the top. Bake the loaf until it is firm, the top is  richly browned, and a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf  registers 160 degrees, 45 to 50 minutes.    Let the meatloaf stand in the baking dish for 5 to 10 minutes before  cutting into squares to serve.    For leftovers, reheat in a microwave and serve on a bed of steamed greens  topped with a spoonful of stewed tomatoes.
