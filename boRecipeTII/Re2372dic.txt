The Cook and Kitchen Staff are offering you the final installment of some  of the best recipes from "Our Daily Bread" collection. Todays recipe is  simply a great-tasting and easy-to-prepare cheese bread. Perfect for  sporting events and tailgate parties, it makes a great base for spinach  dips and stacked sandwiches.    We hope youve enjoyed our brief excursion into bread making and baking,  because tomorrow were off to a land of one-dish main meals, which can only  mean were giving you a peek at our creative casserole collection of  recipes!    Pre-heat oven to 350-F degrees and thoroughly grease the inside (bottom and  all four sides) of a single loaf pan. Reserve.    In a large mixing bowl, sift flour and sugar together. Add grated cheddar  cheese and chopped green onions. Thoroughly mix all ingredients together.  Add beer and stir until the ingredients are uniformly moistened.    Spoon bread dough mixture into a well-greased loaf pan. Bake for  approximately 1 hour, or until the loaf is golden brown and emits a hollow  sound when tapped. Cool on a wire rack, and store in an airtight container.    May freeze for up to 90 days. Slice to serve.    Kitchen Staff Tip: Prepare your own self-rising flour! For every cup of  all-purpose flour, add 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Simply sift together the ingredients and store at room temperature in an  air-tight container.
