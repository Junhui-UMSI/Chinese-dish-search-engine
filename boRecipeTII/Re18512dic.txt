Amaretto Rice Pudding
Dried peaches, Amaretto, White rice, uncooked, Cinnamon, Unsalted butter, Eggs, Evaporated milk, Sugar, Nutmeg, 
Soak the peaches in the Amaretto for 10 minutes. Set aside. Combine the  rice, milk, butter, and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the  heat, and cook until the rice has absorbed the milk but the mixture is  creamy, about 15-20 minutes. Stir constantly so the milk does not curdle.  Add the peaches and cook 1 more minute. Remove from the heat and add eggs.  Return to the heat and cook for about 5 minutes until the mixture is  creamy. To serve, sprinkle individual dishes of rice pudding with cinnamon  and nutmeg.
