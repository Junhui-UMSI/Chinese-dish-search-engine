Very Good Bagel
Yeast, Brown sugar, Water, Salt, All purpose flour, Cornmeal, Bagel toppings, 
1. Proof the yeast with half the brown sugar and all the water. Set aside  until foam forms.   2. Add remaining sugar and salt, stir well. Gradually add the flour.  Knead for about 7 minutes, until smooth and retains a sheen (you may have to add a touch more water). Cover and allow to rest in a warm  place for 40 minutes.      3. Dust large cutting board half with flour and half with cornmeal. Turn out  dough onto floured side. Halve dough and then quarter it. Slice each  quarter into 3 pieces. Roll each piece on the cornmeal dusted side, making  a "snake" that is a little thinner than a broom handle. Form bagel and  pinch one end around the other. Making them "look" like bagels takes some  practice. Place each bagel on a lightly cornmeal-dusted baking sheet. Put  them back in your warm place and let them rest for 30 minutes.      4. Preheat oven to 425F. Heavily dust 2 baking sheets with cornmeal.      5. Fill a large, wide pot almost full of water (leave about 1 - 1?" at top), and bring to a boil. Use a wide flat spatula to drop the  bagels, top down, into the water. Dont let them touch. Boil on one side  for 1 1/2 minutes, then turn and boil on other side for 30 seconds.  Carefully remove from water and drain bottom down on wire rack while next  batch boils. Move each batch from rack to baking sheet before the next  batch is ready to drain.   6. Sprinkle with desired toppings and place in oven for 17 minutes. Turn bagels and bake until brown all over, about 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cool  on paper towels.
