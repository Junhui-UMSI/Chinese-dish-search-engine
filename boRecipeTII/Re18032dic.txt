Cut the tofu, mushrooms, beans, celery & carrot into large julienne  slices.  Chop the green onions.  Set aside.    Put the 3 tb vegetable oil into a wok over medium heat.  When the oil  is hot, stir-fry the garlic until it begins to brown.  Add the soy  sauce, tofu & all the vegetables except the green onions.  Stir-fry  for 10 minutes.  Turn the heat off & add the green onions.    Separate the roll wrappers.  Place the wrapper with the narrow side  facing you.  Place a scant 1/4 c filling about 1/3 of the way over  from the closest edge.  Fold the closest edge to you over the  filling, fold over the left & right edges & then roll.  Seal the end  using just a touch of water.  Place the finished roll seam side down  on a baking sheet until all the rolls have been filled in this way.    Heat the oil for deep frying in a wok until hot.  Deep-fry the rolls  on each side until golden.  Drain & serve hot with cucumber pickle.    Puangkram C. Schmitz & Michael J.
