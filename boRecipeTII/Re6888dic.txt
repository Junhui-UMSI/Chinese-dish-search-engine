Source: Joop S. de Graaf, my dad    A more or less kosher in the sense of legal, version of the recipe leaves  out the distilling, but just consists of the flavoring. Depending on the  brandy you start out with, results can be from good to great. We also make  this with etrog peel after sukkot and then break the fast with it next year  at yom kippur. It is one of these great cycle things in Judaism    Warning: make sure that the rind is pure, without the white inside, which  will make your drink bitter. Also make sure you get a pomelo or etrog that  does not "shine". The shiney ones are treated with a wax. Add everything  together in a bottle with a very tight seal. Keep in a dark cabinet for at  least one month. Filter through cheesecloth. Keeps for a long time.
