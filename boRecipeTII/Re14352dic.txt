Whole Preserved Kumquats
Light corn syrup, Syrup for 2+ quarts fruit, Water, Sugar, 
Prepare kumquats, with a sharp knife cut slits (1 1/2 inch deep) at right  angles on the blossom end. Cook slowly in water, about 10 minutes or until  tender. Drain, cool, squeeze insides out of fruit and run pulp through  potato ricer.    Add to prepared syrup.    Boil syrup for 10 minutes in a separate container, or until thread. Add  drained kumquats and pulp, simmer for 20 minutes, uncovered, and allow to  cool, covered.... Kumquats should be translucent.    Stand overnight and reheat to soft jell, and can.    Makes 6 8oz jars, processed 10 minutes.    Instead of processing, you could freeze or refrigerate this.    you can use these Preserved Kumquats as dessert after an oriental meal;  drain and cut them to drop into cookies; serve as a relish with pork  roasts, fresh or smoked; If you drain very well and chop or slice very  finely, you can use them in the following truly wonderful cake (Pound Cake  A LOrange) from the late MYRIAM GUIDROZ, a marvelous cook who had a column  in the Times Picayune of New Orleans.
