Pumpernickel
Yeast, Instant Coffee, Salt, Water, olive oil, Whole Wheat, Dry milk, Cocoa, Corn Meal, Bran, Molasses, Brotgewurtz, Rye, 
This gives a dark bread; fairly moist, with lots of  texture.    There is also a pumpernickel recipe online on the  cookbook section!    Good luck - and let me know how you like this, if you  try it.    Jeff/Fresno Formatted by Elaine Radis
