Pound the filets with a mallet until very thin. Dust with flour which has  been seasoned with salt and pepper. In a 10 inch skillet, saute veal in  olive oil for 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan. Add butter, mushrooms  and enough red wine to bathe the mushrooms. Cook over medium heat, scraping  the residue from the bottom of the pan until the mushrooms are cooked but  still firm. Add salt, pepper, tarragon and oregano. Replace veal, heaping  wine and mushrooms on top. Cook, stirring occasionally until sauce  thickens.  Yield: 4 servings.
