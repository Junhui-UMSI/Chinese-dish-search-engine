Turkey Congee
Long grain rice, salt and pepper, Short grain, Water, Turkey carcass, 
Place turkey, rice and cold water in large soup pot. Bring to boil. Reduce  heat and simmer 3-4 hours. Stir often to prevent sticking. Remove turkey  and strip meat from bones. Return meat to pot. Serve in soup bowls. Add  chopped green onions and soy sauce if desired. This is a bland, thick soup  and a good way to use up the holiday turkey.
