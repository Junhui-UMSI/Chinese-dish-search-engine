Vegetable and Bacon Risotto
Onion -- chopped, Rice, Vegetable stock, Mushrooms -- sliced, Rashers Bacon, Rindless, Carrot -- chopped, Oil for frying, 
Fry the bacon and vegetables together in a little oil. Add the rice and fry  for 1 minute. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 20  minutes or until all the stock has been absorbed. This meal is more  substantial (and very good) when served with a fried egg on top. Again  depending on the degree of hungriness..    Recipe By     : Anja Wolle <A.C.Wolle@SOTON.AC.UK>
