Pineapple-Apricot Crush
Apricot Halves; Undrained,, Pineapple Juice; Chilled,, Ice Cubes; Up To 8 Can Be, 
Blend the first two ingredients in a blender container, until the apricots  are pureed.  Add the ice cubes 1 at a time until you reach a slushy  consistency.  Before making the drink, check the owners manual about ice  cubes.  A heavy duty machine will do them just fine.
