Truffles (Chocolate)
dark chocolate, , Cream, UNSALTED BUTTER, 
For a small batch (increase by 4x if you want the original recipe)    Day 1:  Melt the chocolate in a double-boiler, and boil the cream briefly.  When the cream has just boiled, quickly add it to the melted chocolate, and  remove from heat.  Stir gently until somewhat cooled, then put in the  refrigerator overnight.  (Mandatory: you cant shorten that step)    Day 2: Melt the chocolate mixture in a double boiler, and add the softened  butter.  Whip with a whisk until the mixture is cool, and then place in the  refrigerator overnight.    Day 3: Melt again.  If youre adding a flavoring, such as Amaretto, Grand  Mariner, etc (traditional, but not essential), this is the time. I used 1/3  cup of amarettor, and a touch of vanilla for an accent. Whip carefully  until cool, and then place in the refrigerator until firm.    The original recipe at this point says to use a pastry funnel and tip, but  I let it get a touch harder, and then used a spoon and carefully shaped  them with my hands.  Do this on a piece of waxed paper or foil with cocoa  powder, and roll them gently in teh powder.  When all are formed, back to  teh fridge. Allow to firm up, and serve after allowing them to approach  room temperature.    Since this recipe is a bit soft, you may wish to coat them with a harder  dark chocolate outside, though this is left as an exercise for the reader.    The Chefs Comments: "For the dedicated, or truly bored (i.e. youre snowed  in for a week, or you have a chocolate tolerance where nothing but the  high-end does it for you anymore), I present the Infamous Chocolate  Truffle." - Ferd    From: Ferd Date: 11-09-96 (01:10) The Polka Dot Cottage, a BBS with a taste  of home. 1-973-822-3627    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #713 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  97
