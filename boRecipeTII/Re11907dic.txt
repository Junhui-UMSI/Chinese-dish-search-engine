Im not sure if the food column I got this from is syndicated... If so, Im  sure some of you have seen this by now. But Ill post it anyway! I just  made these tonight and they were SO GOOD and SO EASY I couldnt believe it!  The original recipe called for an egg, which I left out. Ill post it  exactly the way I cooked it:    Boil eggplant in salted water until tender. (I know we just had a back and  forth about whether or not to salt eggplant, but I like it salted!) While  its cooking, combine all other stuff (except cooking spray) in a big bowl.  Mash eggplant well (I used a food processor) and mix with other stuff. Make  small patties and cook on heated, sprayed non-stick pan. Turn once; cook  until golden brown on both sides. THATS IT!!! They were delicious. Enjoy!
