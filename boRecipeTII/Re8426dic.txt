Directions: Place potato in a small saucepan; cover with water, and bring  to a boil.    Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes or until very tender; drain.  Press potato through a sieve into a bowl. Set aside 1/2 cup potato, and  discard remaining potato.    Heat milk over medium-high heat in a heavy saucepan to 180 deg or until  tiny bubbles form around edge. (Do not boil.) Remove from heat; let cool  until very warm (120-130 degrees).    Combine yeast, 1 cup flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; stir well. Add  1/2 cup potato, very warm milk, margarine, and egg; beat at medium speed of  an electric mixer until smooth. Add 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in  1-1/4 cups flour to form a soft dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly  floured surface. Knead dough until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes);  add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough  from sticking to hands.    Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 45  minutes or until doubled in bulk.    Punch dough down, and turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead  lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough in half; cut each half into 8 equal  portions, shaping each piece into a ball with lightly floured hands. (Cover  remaining dough while working to prevent it from drying out.) Place balls 3  inches apart on baking sheets coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise  in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 25 minutes or until doubled  in bulk.    Uncover dough. Bake at 325 degrees for 23 minutes or until lightly browned.
