FROM:      Bill Segui    Number of Servings:   8    MOUSSE: Melt the chocolate and butter in top of a double boiler over barely  simmering water. Stir until smooth. Transfer to medium bowl. Whisk in egg  yolks. Beat egg whites, salt and cream of tartar in another bowl until soft  peaks form. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Fold  in chocolate. In another bowl, beat cream with 2 tablespoons of sugar and  vanilla until slightly thickened. Fold into chocolate. Pour into metal  bowl. Cover and chill over night.    Chill ravioli mold in freezer. Preheat oven on lowest setting for 5  minutes. Turn off oven. Place white chocolate on baking sheets. Place in  turned off oven and let stand until soft enough to yield when pressed with  finger, about 5 minutes.    Roll one piece of chocolate out on a sheet of parchment paper to flatten  slightly. Lift chocolate off paper, using a thin knife if necessary. Turn  pasta machine to widest setting. Run chocolate through. Adjust pasta  machine to next narrower setting. Run chocolate through the machine again.    Repeat, narrowing follers after each run until chocolate is 1/16 inch  thick. Quickly press chocolate into chilled ravioli mold.    Fill each ravioli with 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of mousse filling. Repeat  rolling with second piece of chocolate, resoftening in oven as necessary.  Complete ravioli. Seal with rolling pin. Invert mold, pressing gently to  release ravioli. Cut into separate pieces with ravioli cutter or knife if  necessary. Place on chilled baking sheet and refrigerate.    Before serving, let chocolate ravioli stand at room temperature for 30  minutes. Arrange four ravioli on each plate. Sprinkle with nuts and garnish  with mint.
