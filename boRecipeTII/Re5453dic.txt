Prepare cake mix according to directions.  Cook in 2 layers.  Drain the  pineapple well, reserving juice.  For icing, combine flour and sugar in a  saucepan.  Stir in 1 cup of pineapple juice that has been drained from the  crushed pineapple.  Blend and bring this mixture to a boil, stirring  constantly.  Boil and stir for 1 minute.  Remove from heat and stir in  crushed, drained pineapple.  Allow to cool.  Whip the cream until slightly  stiff peaks form.  Fold half the cream into cooled pineapple mixture.  To  remaining whipped cream add 1 tablespoon confectioners sugar and whip only  until blended.  Spread 1/3 the pineapple mix on one cake layer.  Top with  the second layer and spread with remaining mixture.  Use the whipped  topping to spread on the sides of cake.  Garnish the top with the kiwi  fruit sliced thin.  Use the strawberries whole as a garnish on top or place  around side of cake.  Chill cake for at least 6 hours before serving.
