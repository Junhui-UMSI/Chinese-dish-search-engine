Apple Puffs
Powdered sugar, Vegetable oil*, Large ripe strawberries, Large egg, Aunt Jemima (Orig) pancake m, Jar chunky apple sauce, Skim milk, Cinnamon, 
Mix the  pancake mix, milk, egg and oil in a 2 cup measure. OK to have a  little rough mixture. Make the mixture a little thinner than regular batter  but thicker than for a crepe.    Heat an 8" shallow Teflon (sloped sided) pan with a drop of oil on medium  heat. Pour in 1/4 of the batter (enough to make a thin pancake. Allow the  dough to cook until the bubbles form on top but the pk is not cooked all  the way through. The bottom should be a light golden brown. Scoop 3 Tbs of  apple sauce on one half of the pancake. Quickly fold the other half over so  it puffs up. Cook for about a minute or so (being careful not to burn).  Turn over briefly to cook other side and warm the apples.    Serve each on a large platter and top with cinnamon and sliced  strawberries Finish with a little powdered sugar.    I think what happened was that the applesauce mixed with the still  uncooked pancake top and was cooked (combined) to make an unusual fluffy  inside. * Use one Tb of oil to cut fat. ...George
