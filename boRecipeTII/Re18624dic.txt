Bring 1 1/2 gal water to 160 degrees and stir in crushed grains. Keep the  mash temp between 148-152 for 1 hr.  Best way is to place covered brewing  kettle in 140 degree oven.  Stir twice while mashing.    Test the mash conversion by placing drop of mash onto white plate, then  place a drop of iodine into the solution.  If solution turns purple/black  you must continue the mash until the solution is clear when the iodine is  added.    Pour mash thru a strainer, allowing the wort to flow thru into your brew  pot. Bring 1-2 gal water to 135-150 degrees. Slowly sparge the grains with  sparge water until it runs clear. The sparge water will become part of the  boil. At this point you will continue as usual.    Dissolve malt extract and brown sugar into wort, add 1 oz northern brewer  hops and boil for 45 min.  Add 1/2 oz plug and boil for 15 min more.  For  the last 5 min of the boil, add the fuggles pellets. Cool the wort and  bring volume up to 5 gal. Pitching temp: 80 or less    O.G. 1045-1055 F.G. 1010-1014    Recipe By     : Jaspers    From: Ladies Home Journal- August 1991    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
