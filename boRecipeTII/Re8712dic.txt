Cover and simmer. Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium  skillet and add the onions. Sprinkle with the sugar and cook until golden  and glazed, shaking the pan often. Transfer the onions to a plate and clean  the skillet. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoon butter in the skillet, add  sliced mushrooms and saute for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring gently. Remove and  add to simmering chicken, along with the onions and tomatoes. Recover the  heat and simmer 20 minutes more. Adjust seasoning to taste. Sprinkle with  the chopped parsley and serve.
