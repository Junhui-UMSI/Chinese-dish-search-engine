Grind soaked chilies with the ginger and garlic in a  blender. Now put the vinegar, sugar and salt in a large pan and bring to a  boil. At this point, add the tomatoes, dates and the teaspoon of the spice  powder. Stir them round and then simmer on a moderate heat until the  mixture becomes very thick and has the consistency you like for chutney.  Remove the pan from the heat, allow to cool a little and then spoon the  chutney into warmed jars. Cover and once opened, store in the refrigerator  for up to 6 weeks.
