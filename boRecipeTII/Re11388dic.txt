1. To attain maximum heat, preheat broiler for at least 15 minutes before  using.    2. Broil chicken halves, turning once, for about 30 minutes or until skin  is golden-brown and juices run clear when bird is pierced with a fork.    3. Remove chicken from broiler, leaving broiler on. Using a very sharp  knife, cut each half into about 6 pieces (leg, thigh, wing, 3 small breast  pieces).    4. Place chicken on a baking sheet with sides, of a size that can fit into  the broiler. Pour Lemon Sauce over the chicken and toss to coat well. If  necessary, divide sauce in half and do this in two batches.    5. Return to broiler and broil for 3 minutes. Turn each piece and broil for  an additional minute.    6. Remove from broiler and portion each chicken onto each of 6 warm serving  plates.    7. Pour sauce into a heavy saucepan. Stir in parsley and place over high  heat for 1 minute. Pour an equal amount of sauce over each chicken and  serve with lots of crusty bread to absorb the sauce.
