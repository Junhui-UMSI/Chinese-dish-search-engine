Cooking Beans in a Crockpot
Dried beans, Water, 
Cooking beans: Always drain and rinse beans after soaking. Cook in fresh,  cold water.    Crockery Cooker Method: Use 3 cups water for each cup of soaked and drained  beans. Cover beans with water and cook on low for 8 to 12 hours.    Variation: Soaking may be eliminated: cook beans 12 hours. Note: beans  should be well rinsed; omitting the soaking step does not reduce gastric  problems.    NOTE: Refer to your crockpots manual for the setting; it could be low but  not lowest.    * INFO * Instructions from Gourmet Grains, Beans & Rice: Simple, Savory,  and Sophisticated Recipes by Dotty Griffith (Taylor, 1992) 0878337857 ppr.
