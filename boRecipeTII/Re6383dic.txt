Ploughmans Fondue
Clove garlic, halved, Dry mustard, Cheddar cheese, grated, Cornstarch, Butter, Beer, 
Rub the cut side of the garlic on the inside of the fondue pot. Pour in the  beer and heat until just bubbling. Gradually add the cheese, stirring until  melted. Stir in the butter. Blend the mustard and cornstarch with a little  water and stir into the fondue. Continue to cook over a gentle heat until  it thickens. Reduce heat to keep warm.    Typed into MasterCook by Lisa Johnston My notes: If you have ever been to  The Melting Pot, this is almost exactly their cheddar fondue. They do not  use butter and I dont think it needs it. They also use a 3 parts sharp  cheddar to 1 part Swiss Emmanthaler (sp?) mix of cheese - this adds a nice  bite, but the swiss makes it not too sharp. They also just coat the cheese  in some flour instead of using cornstarch and water. A little bit of ground  white pepper is also good.    Notes: As the name implies, this fondue should be served with chunks of  crusty white bread, pieces of celery, pickled onions, gherkins, cherry  tomatoes and wedges of crisp dessert apple.
