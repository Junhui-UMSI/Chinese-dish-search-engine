Raspberry-Cream Cheese Coffee Cake
Baking Powder, almonds, Almond extract, Raspberry perserves, Eggs, Cream cheese, unsalted butter, Baking soda, All-purpose flour, Salt, Sour cream, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour the bottom and sides of a 9-inch  springform pan.    In a large bowl, combine the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar. Using a pastry  blender or fork, cut in the batter until the mixture resembles coarse  crumbs. Reserve 1 cup and set aside.    To the remaining crumb mixture, add the baking powder, soda, salt, sour  cream, almond extract and 1 egg. Blend well. With oiled hands, gently pat  the dough over the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the springform  pan; the mixture will be a little sticky.    In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and  1 egg.  Blend well.  Pour into the batter-lined pan. In a small saucepan,  warm the preserves. Carefully spoon the preserves evenly over the cream  cheese mixture.  Stir the  sliced almonds into the reserved crumb mixture  and sprinkle over the preserves. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the  cream cheese filling is set and the crust is deep golden brown. Cool on a  rack for 15 minutes, then remove from the pan. The cake can be served warm  or cool, but it should be stored in the refrigerator.    Reprinted from Marcia Adams Heirloom Recipes Cookbook.
