Baby Bird Food
Hard-boiled egg; mashed, Ken-L Ration dog food, Hi-Protein baby cereal, 
Mix well. Form into rather large pellets (the size of a raisin). Offer to  birds every half hour, feeding as much as they will take each time. Mixture  may be refrigerated. Offer water from medicine dropper, but very little is  needed and should be given carefully to avoid aspiration into lungs causing  pneumonia. It is next to impossible to overfeed.    Note: It is illegal in most states to cage most wild baby birds, but this  food may save them until they can be released.    Recipe by: When Fall From A Nest.
