Barbeque Dry Rub
Cumin, Thyme, Garlic powder, Black Pepper, Cayenne pepper, Salt, Curry powder, Onion powder, Monosodium glutamate, 
 In a small bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine all the ingredients. Stir or shake to mix.  Use immediately or store in a cool, dark place for  several months.    This rub is pretty strong and so I do not recommend it for thin cuts (like  ribs).  Bit it is swell on heavier cuts of meat such as beef round, prime  rib, pork shoulders, and even the whole hog. With this recipes, you have  enough for five shoulders or four hams. Best if you let the meat marinate,  loosely covered, in the refrigerator for a good twenth-four to forty-eight  hours after being rubbed.
