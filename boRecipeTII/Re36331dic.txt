Whisk together oil, lemon juice, water, mustard, honey, oregano and pepper  in large bowl. Add beef, bell pepper and mushrooms, turning to coat.  Alternately thread beef, bell pepper, and mushrooms on each of four 12"  metal skewers. Place kabobs on rack in broiler pan so surface of meat is 3  to 4" from heat. Broil 9 to 12 minutes for rare to medium, turning  occasionally. Season with salt, if desired.     Makes 4 servings.
