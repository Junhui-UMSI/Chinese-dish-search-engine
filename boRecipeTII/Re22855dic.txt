Apricot-Glazed Ham
Ham (10 - 12 pound), Dry sherry, Apricot jam, Cloves, Dijon mustard, 
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Line baking pan with aluminum foil. Place ham  on  foil, fat side up, and wrap well with more foil.  For "fully cooked"  boneless ham, cook 15 to 18 minutes per pound until meat thermometer  registers internal temperature of 140 degrees.  For boneless ham labeled  "cook before eating," cook 17 to 21 minutes pre ound until meat thermometer  registers internal temperature of 160 degrees.    Remove ham from oven and trim of excess fat.  Score ham in diamond pattern  and stud with cloves.    In smalll bowl, combine mustard, jam and sherry until smooth.  Coat ham  with glaze and return to oven 1 hour, spooning glaze over ham every 15  minutes.  (Figure this 1 hour into total time needed to cook ham.)    Notes:  I use a bone-in ham -- love to have the bone left over for ham and  beans.  Just needs a little more time to cook.    Also, I usually make a little extra sauce so everyone can pour it over  their ham at the table.
