Peanut Stuffed Chicken Breast
Chicken breasts, boned, Peanut butter, Honey, Mint, dried, Cumin, 
Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as possible.  (Its much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any knifework Ive  tried to date.) Pull off shreds and gobbets. Put peanut butter, honey,  cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well. Microwaving for 30 seconds or so  thins it and makes it much easier to mix. Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut  butter mix in a thin layer over each piece of breast meat. Place 1/12 of  the shreds and gobbets on the breast and roll them up into a packet. Tie  the packet shut with butchers twine or fasten with a toothpick. Arrange  the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful not to let any  fall open. Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and  mix well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets. Add  water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch. Turn  crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours. Remove packets from pot and let drain  on a platter. All the chicken fat will have migrated to the top of the  liquid, which I suspect would probably make a wonderful flavoring for soups  and other dishes.
