Wash the rice in cool water, squeezing gently with your fingers, until the  water runs clear.  Put the rice in about 2 cups of cool water to soak for  20 minutes. Strain soak water into saucepan and heat. Leave rice to dry in  strainer.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    While rice is drying, chop onion finely and set aside.  Dice carrots and  set aside. Measure spices.    When rice is dry, heat oil over medium-high flame in heavy, oven-proof  skillet or casserole dish. Add spices. When spices become fragrant, add  butter and onions. Cook until onions are tender and light golden brown. Add  carrots and cook for 3-5 minutes.    Add rice and cook, stirring very gently for 5 minutes.  Add salt and heated  soak water, bring to boil.  Reduce heat and simmer until water on top of  rice has boiled off. Cover tightly and cook for 20 minutes at 350 degrees  F. Remove from oven, let rest for 10 minutes, then serve.    NOTES:    *  Basmati Rice with Carrots -- This is a delicate, fragrant rice dish, one  of our favorites. I got the recipe from an Indian cooking class. Its a bit  of work, but well worth it.    *  It is important to handle the rice gently so that the grains are not  broken.  Its also important to use whole spices; ground spices would  overpower the rice.    *  This dish can be re-heated in the oven.    : Difficulty:  easy.    : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.    : Precision:  measure the ingredients.    : Nancy Mintz    : AT&T-Information Systems, UNIX System Development Lab, Summit, NJ    : ihnp4!attunix!nlm    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust    Date: Wed, 12 Jun 1996 22:11:02 -0700    From: Julie Bertholf <jewel1@ix.netcom.com>    MM-Recipes Digest V3 #164    From the MealMaster recipe list.
