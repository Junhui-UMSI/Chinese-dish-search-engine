Place brisket, fat side down, in 11 1/2 x 9-inch disposable  aluminum pan. Add 1 cup water. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place  in center of grid over very low coals*. Cover cooker and cook 5 hours,  turning brisket over every 11/2 hours; remove excess fat from pan with  baster as it accumulates. Add additional 1/2 cup water to pan, if needed.  Periodically add just enough additional briquets to keep coals at very low  temperature. Remove brisket form pan; reserve pan drippings.

Meanwhile skim and discard fat from pan  drippings; reserve 1 cup drippings. Melt butter in medium saucepan over  medium heat. Add onions; cook until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally.  Add reserved pan drippings, remaining 1/2 ! ! ! teaspoon pepper, catsup,  lemon juice, worcestershire sauce and pepper sauce; simmer approximately 15  minutes, stirring occasionally. Trim excess fat from brisket; carve brisket  across the grain into thin slices.    Serving Ideas : Serve brisket with sauce.    NOTES : Coals should be in a single layer with space between each briquet.  To check temperature, cautiously hold hand about 4 inches above coals. Very  low coals will force removal of hand in 6 to 7 seconds. Water Smoker  Directions: Prepare smoker according to manufacturers directions. Place  beef brisket, fat side up, in center of cooking rack. Cover smoker and  smoke-cook at low to moderate temperature 4 1/2 to 5 hours or until tender.
