TABASCO CLASSIC: Walter McIlhenny was very fond of homemade chili and liked  to serve his version to former Marine Corps buddies who visited him on the  island.    In a 5-quart Dutch oven or heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high  heat.  In three batches, brown the beef well, removing each batch with a  slotted spoon. Set aside.    Add the onion and garlic to the pot and cook for 5 minutes, or until  tender, stirring frequently.  Stir in the chili powder, cumin, salt, and  Tabasco sauce; cook for 1 minute. Add the water and chilies; bring to a  boil.  Return the beef to the pot.  Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered,  1-1/2 hours, or until the beef is tender. Serve the chili over rice with  onion, cheese and sour cream, if desired.
