Wilted Frisee and Bacon Salad
Red wine vinegar, Vegetable oil, Cognac, Black Pepper, Thickly sliced lean smoked, Head chicory or escarole;, 
Trim any rind or bone from the bacon, then cut across the slices to make  strips, called in French lardons. Heat the oil with the lardons in a frying  pan over medium heat and fry until the fat is rendered and the bacon is  beginning to brown.    Trim the stem of the chicory or escarole. Pull off most of the green  outside leaves and discard them as they are very tough. Pull apart the  remaining white and pale green leaves. If they are dirty immerse them in a  sink full of cold water and shake them with your hands to loosen grit. Lift  them out with your hands, so grit is left behind. Dry the leaves in a salad  spinner or roll them in a dry dish towel. Transfer them to a salad bowl and  have two salad spoons ready.    Continue cooking the bacon until brown, even crispy if you like. If you  have more than about 3 tablespoons of fat, discard some. Pour the hot fat  and bacon over the salad greens and toss well so the leaves wilt and are  evenly coated.    Put the pan back on the heat, add the vinegar, and cook, stirring to  dissolve the sticky juices on the bottom of the pan, until reduced by about  half.    Take the pan from the heat, add the cognac, and flame it by lighting with a  match, again standing well back. If the cognac does not light at once, put  it back over the heat.    Pour this over the greens and toss again. Add freshly ground black pepper,  taste and adjust the seasoning.
