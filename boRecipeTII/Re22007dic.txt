Heat oil in heavy medium saucepan over high heat.  Add turkey; saute until  just golden, about 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium.  Sprinkle cornmeal  and cumin over turkey and stir 1 minute. Add green onions and stir just  until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 cup broth and chilies and simmer  until chili thickens, about 5 minutes. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and  chill. Rewarm over low heat, thinning with additional broth, if desired.)  Serves 2.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #269    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
