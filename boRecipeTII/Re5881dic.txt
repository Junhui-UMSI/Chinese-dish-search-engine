Here are some Polish recipes Ive gotten from my mother-in-law. They are  "word-of mouth" recipes, passed down from Grandma to Mom to me. Hope these  help.    Mix well and knead the dough until it doesnt stick to your hands. Roll out  dough, not too thin. Cut dough in small circles. Put a tablespoon of cheese  mixture (recipe follows) on dough, fold over and press together with fork,  using water so fork doesnt stick to dough. Drop in boiling water for about  15-20 minutes til tender (when they float to the top, theyre done). Drain,  then fry in butter until brown and crispy and serve with sour cream.    Cheese Filling: Mix ingredients together until cheese is smooth. If too  dry, add a little sour cream.    Note: There are many fillings for Pirogis but in the Falcon household, only  cheese filling would do. BTW, the last name of Falcon is English for the  Polish last name of Sokolowski - Sokol in Polish means "falcon", as I am  told by "The Family"! :) Enjoy!
