Quick Fix Chile
Plus 2 tsp Mexican Chile, Diced jalapenos; canned, Cayenne pepper powder, Canned tomato sauce, salt and pepper, Onion; diced, Chicken broth, Ripe tomato; diced, Mexican salsa; 1 can Embassa, Lean hamburger; not more, Plus l tsp cumin; ground, Dried marjoram flakes, Water, Diced green chiles; canned, Cajun sausage; if link style, Canned pinto beans; Ranch, 
In a large pot saute the hamburger, Cajun sausage and onions until almost  all the liquid is gone. Stir constantly to crumble the hamburger and  sausage. If you purchase Cajun link sausage remove the casings prior to  cooking. Add all the remaining ingredients except the pinto beans and  simmer until most of the vegetables have cooked and blended together. About  30 minutes. Add the beans and simmer until heated through. Salt and pepper  to taste. Serves 8.    NOTES :   Note - If it starts to get too dry add a little more water. If a  less spicy chile is desired, omit the cayenne pepper or add pinto beans  without jalapenos in them. This should only take about 1 hour to prepare.  This is quick and easy but very tasty.
