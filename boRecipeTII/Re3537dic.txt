Pecan Pralines - Dupree
Butter, Light corn syrup, Pecan halves, Vanilla, Water, Sugar, 
Heat the sugar, syrup, water, and pecans in a heavy saucepan until the  sugar is disolved.  Bring the mixture to the boil, stirring occasionally,  until it reaches the soft ball stage (240F). Remove the saucepan from the  heat and add butter and vanilla.     Allow candy to cool.  Whip until the mixture gradually changes to an  opaque color and becomes creamy. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto a buttered  cookie sheet and allow to harden. Makes two dozen. From Nathalie Duprees  New Southern Cooking Nathalie Dupree writes, "Pralines are traditionally  given as Christmas gifts.  Their sweetness will linger in your mouth long  after the candy is gone."
