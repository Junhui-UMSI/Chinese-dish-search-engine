Cook pinto beans till very soft.  Drain & mash.  Saute celery till soft.  Add tomatoes, basil & salt.  Cook for a few minutes & add ketchup & cooked  beans.  You should have a thick paste. Add a little water if necessary.    Cut tops of peppers, remove seeds & stuff with the saute. Sprinkle with  nutritional yeast.  Bake in a hot oven for about 30 minutes. The peppers  should sit in a little water so as not to dry out.    Adapted from King & Scott, "Food for Thought"
