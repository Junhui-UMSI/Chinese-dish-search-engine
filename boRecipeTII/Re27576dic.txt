The Best Banana Bread (Ovo)
Is best, but any other is, Baking soda, Salt, Applesauce (baby applesauce, Non-fat yogurt if you use, Sugar, Fine ), And 1/2 cups flour (I use, Cup), Whole wheat usually), Replacement for 1 egg (can, Be 2 egg whites or one egg, Those things), Bananas (enough to mash 1, White and 1/3 c., 
With a mixer, beat the mashed bananas with the sugar. Add the egg replacer  and applesauce and beat again.    In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients.  Add this to the banana mixture  and stir with a spoon until the dry stuff is all moistened. Not too much  stirring!    Pour batter into a loaf pan.  (About 5 x 9 inches, preferrably non-stick or  you can spray with Bakers Secret for a split second and spread with a  paper towel.)    Bake at 325 (be sure to preheat first) for about 55 minutes.    This is great the second day and freezes great, too. If you have enough  bananas make two and freeze one.
