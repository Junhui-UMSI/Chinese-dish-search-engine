Apple Oatmeal Crumble
All-purpose flour, Fresh Lemon Juice, Ground cinnamon, Butter, White sugar, Rolled oats, old-fashioned, nuts, apples, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter a shallow 8-cup ovenproof pan.    In a large bowl toss the apple slices with the lemon juice and 2  tablespoons of the sugar. Spread the slices in the buttered pan. In the  same bowl mix the remaining sugar, oats, flour, and cinnamon. With your  fingertips rub the butter into the dry ingredients until it sticks together  in crumbles, then mix in the nuts. Scatter the topping over the apple  slices. Put the pan in the oven and bake until the topping is brown and  crisp and the apples tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream  or whipped cream.    NOTES : The oatmeal in this version of an old favorite gives crunch; add  nuts or not, as you like.  Use peaches, pears, plums, or another fruit.
