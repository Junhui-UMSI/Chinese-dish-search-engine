Pepper Jack Bread - 1 1/2-Pound Loaf
Monterey pepper jack cheese;, Sugar, Butter, Eggs, Salt, Active dry yeast; preferably, Flat beer, Bread flour, 
Makes 1 1/2 pound loaf.    Dump in bread machine in order recommended by manufacturer. It is  recommended to add half the cheese at the beginning, with the eggs, and the  other half at the beep for raisin bread setting.    This is great with chili. It always reminds me of football games. Rah!
