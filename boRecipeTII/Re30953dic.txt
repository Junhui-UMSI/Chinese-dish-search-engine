Fresh Cilantro, Old El Paso Mini Taco, Goat Cheese; Crumbled, (15 oz) Black beans; Drained, 
1. Heat oven to 350F. In medium bowl, combine beans, salsa, and cilantro;  mix well.    2. Arrange taco shells in 13x9-inch pan. Spoon bean mixture into taco  shells; top with cheese.    3. Bake at 350F for 12-15 minutes or until thoroughly heated.    NOTES : KITCHEN TIP: To keep the taco shells upright during baking, spread  a 1/2-inch layer of uncooked rice or dried beans in the bottom of the  baking pan.  Nestle the taco shells in the pan. Baked raw rice or beans  cannot be prepared and eaten; discard them, or save the beans for use as  pie weights.
