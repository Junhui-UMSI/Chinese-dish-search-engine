Since I was using  frozen berries, i didnt have to wait for the liquid to cool. Add berries  to syrup, then puree in blender in small batches. Chill in freezer in a  glass casserole or metal pan until thoroughly cool, but not frozen solid.  Stir in lemon juice and fold in egg whites. Freeze four to six hours,  folding mixture once or twice. Thaw slightly before serving. It was a  terrific dessert and I imagine could use any fruit, fresh or frozen.    Optional: I added a splash of rum to the berry puree for a daquiri flavour  and garnished the frozen sorbet with lime slices. Hey, it was Saturday  night!
