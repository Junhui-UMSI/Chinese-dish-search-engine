Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously oil a 9 x 13- inch baking dish.  Evenly layer halp of the potatoes over bottom of pan. Drizzle with 1/2 cup  beef broth, rosemary, salt and pepper to taste. Tuck garlic cloves randomly  amid potatoes. Bake 1 hour.    Increase oven heat to 400 degrees. Brush olive oil over potatoes. Bake 30  minutes more, or until potatoes are rown and crispy. If desired, sprinkly  cheese over potatoes 10 minutes before end of baking time.    Author notes: "This dish delivers crisp, browned potatoes and creamy-soft  garlic: the latter can be squeezed out of its skin and spread on the  potatoes. A food processor fitted with the 3mm clicing blade makes quick  work of slicing the potatoes, which I dont peel because I like the flavor  of the skins."
