Cranberry Chutney #2
Water, Sugar, Cranberries, Vinegar, Raisins, Peeled, Allspice, Ground ginger, Cinnamon, Ground cloves, 
Bring water and sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add  remaining ingredients; return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes  or until apples are tender. Pour into a glass mixing bowl.    Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on chutney. Cool to room  temperature; then refrigerate overnight, covered with plastic wrap, so  flavors blend. Serve at room temperature directly on bagels or over a layer  of cream cheese. Yields      2 1/2    cups or 10 to 16 servings.    The Best Bagels are made at home by Dona Z.
