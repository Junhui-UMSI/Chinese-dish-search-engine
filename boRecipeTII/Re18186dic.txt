Because venison has so little fat, youll need to add some for a juicy  burger. But dont use deer fat - it tastes bad.)    Mix venison, pork, salt and pepper, handling as little as possible.  Heat grill. Brush burgers with vegetable oil and grill about 4  minutes; turn and cook to desired doneness. Serve on rolls with your  choice of condiments.
