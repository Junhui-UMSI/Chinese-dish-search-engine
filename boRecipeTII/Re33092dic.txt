Basic Fern Preparation
salt and pepper, Lemon juice or any sauce, for asparagus, ;Boiling salted water, Butter, Ferns, 
Tatum writes: "The young, tender, tightly curled fronds - croziers or  fiddleheads - of bracken (or brake ferns) and of ostrich and cinnamon ferns  are all prepared in the same way.    "Rub off the fuzz (or, for some ferns, the scaly coating) of the young,  crisp fronds, wash them and place them, lying flat, in a saucepan or  skillet with a small amount of boiling salted water. Bring water again to a  boil.  Turn to low heat, cover and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes, or until  fronds are just tender (time will depend on the size and kind of fronds)."    Season with butter, salt and pepper to taste, or serve with lemon juice of  any sauce suitable for asparagus.    From "Billy Joe Tatums Wild Foods Cookbook and Field Guide" by Billy Joe  Tatum.
