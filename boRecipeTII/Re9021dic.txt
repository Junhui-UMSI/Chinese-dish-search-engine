Prepare the dried red chiles. See recipe "prik kaeng phet".    Coarsely chop the chilis.  Toast the dry seeds in a heavy iron skillet or  wok, and grind them coarsely.  Add all the ingredients to a food processor  and process to a smooth paste. Place in tightly stoppered jars, and keep in  the fridge for at least a week for the flavors to combine and develop  before use.    See "Thai Curries (Help)" for information on Thai curry pastes.
