Sweet and Sour Brussel Sprouts with Bacon
Brussel Sprouts, Onions, Sugar, Cider vinegar, Bacon, 
Trim brussel sprouts and slice thinly across the sprouts; the sliced  sprouts should be similar to shredded cabbage. Fry the bacon in a skillet  until crisp; remove the bacon, drain and crumble. Pour off all but 1-2  tablespoons of fat (to taste) from skillet.    Heat bacon fat in skillet over medium high heat; add shredded sprouts and  sliced onions and stir fry until limp and slightly browned. Add sugar and  stir fry for an additional minute or two, until the sugar is dissolved and  vegetables are lightly caramelized. Add cider vinegar, salt and pepper and  stir fry for an additional 2 minutes. Sprinkle with crumbled bacon.    Serve immediately or transfer to casserole dish and dip warm, covered,  until ready to serve.    NOTES : People who hate brussel sprouts love this dish! Dont tell them  its brussel sprouts and youll have lots of questions about the recipe and  the unique vegetable.
