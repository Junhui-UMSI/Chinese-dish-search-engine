In mixing bowl, blend flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda  and salt.    4. In another bowl, beat eggs, yogurt, melted butter, and vanilla extract  until smooth.    5. Stir into dry ingredients to make smooth, thick batter.    6. Combine thawed raspberries with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar.    7. Spoon batter into greased 9-inch springform pan or other round cake pan.  Spread raspberry mixture on top.    8. Bake in preheated 350F oven 45 to 50 minutes or until done.    NOTES : [This is an adaptation of a recipe for peach almond cake, changed  so it could be served to a friend with allergies to tree nuts and fruits.  It tasted better than the peach almond version]. 1.The recipe listed  all-purpose flour, but  I used whole wheat flour. 2. The recipe calls for  plain yogurt, but I always use Biobest 1% fat active-culture yogurt (made  by Astro), so I have entered the ingredients in this manner to determine  the nutritional content.
