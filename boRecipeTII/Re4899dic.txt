Pickled Eggs
Bay leaf, Peppercorns, crushed, Cinnamon, Eggs, hard-boiled (shelled), Mustard seeds, Cloves, Salt, White vinegar, 
Directions: ? Place everything, except the eggs, into a saucepan. ? Bring  gently to the boil, then remove to a basin. Cover and leave to  cool. ? Let the liquid stand for 4 hours before using it, to allow the  spices and  herbs to flavour the vinegar. ? Strain the vinegar. ? If the  spices and are left in, they discolour the eggs. ? Put the eggs into dry,  sterelised, widw-necked jars-dont pack them  too firmly. ? Pour the liquid over the eggs to cover them, then seal the  jars. ? Dont use for a couple of days after they are prepared. I find they  keep perfectly for at least 6 weeks but they must be kept  refrigerated. Cut the eggs into quarters or halves to serve or use  slices as a garnish on biscuits or cold meat.
