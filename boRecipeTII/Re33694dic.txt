Remove salmon  from the refrigerator and let is sit covered at room temperature for 15 to       20    minutes.    Transfer salmon to the smoker.  Smoke steaks until just cooked through and  flaky, about 45 to 55 minutes at a temperature of 225 to 250 degrees.    Transfer salmon to a platter and serve hot or chilled.
