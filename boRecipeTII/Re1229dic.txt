Crown Roast of Pork
Garlic, olive oil, Salt to taste, Black pepper, Apple cider, Roasted Holiday Vegetables, Rosemary, Crown roast of pork, 
when the butcher prepares a crown roast, two sides of the pork loin are  tied together. The ends of the bones are trimmed and any scraps removed  (Frenched). The trimmings are ground up and usually placed in the center of  the roast, but I prefer to freeze this meat for another use and fill the  roast with fresh vegetables instead. - Sheila Lukins    1. Preheat oven to 350F. Make tiny slits around the bottom of chops.  Insert the garlic slivers.    2. Brush the chops lightly with oil and sprinkle all over with salt and  pepper. Place roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Cover the bone  tips with foil to keep them from burning. Pour cider in the pan.    3. Bake for 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 hours (15 to 18 minutes per pound) or until a  meat thermometer reads 150F. when inserted into the thickest part of a  chop, basting occasionally with the pan juices. (Pork is bred much leaner  these days; check the temperature for doneness after        2    hours.)    4. Transfer roast to a large serving platter and fill center with Roasted  Holiday Vegetables. Entwine long sprigs of fresh rosemary through the bones  and decorate the tops of the bones with silver-paper frills.
