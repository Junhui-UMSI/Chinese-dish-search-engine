Each muffin only has 89 calories and 0.2 grams fat. They  are really tasty, rise well, and are nice and light in texture. Based on my  personal experience, I strongly recommend you not use muffin papers. But if  you do a 1-second squirt of Pam (or equivalent) in each cup, theyll slide  right out. They freeze well, too. Enjoy.    In large mixing bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and  salt. Gently stir in yogurt and milk, blending just until dry ingredients  are moistened. Fill lightly greased muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake at 400? for  18 minutes or until well-browned. Serve warm.    NOTE: Do not use muffin papers--the muffins become one with the papers.
