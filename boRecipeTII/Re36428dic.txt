Remove tops from beer cans with can opener; lightly oil insides. Sprinkle  soda on dates.  Heat beer to boiling and pour over date/soda mixture; set  aside to cool. Cream together butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and eggs. Stir  in flour.  Add nuts and cooled date mixture. Spoon batter into cans,  filling only 1/2 full.
