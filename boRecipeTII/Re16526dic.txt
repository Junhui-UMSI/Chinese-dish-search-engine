Fry onion, garlic, and white stems of chard until barely limp. Add chopped  greens and fry a bit. Either peel the yams or scrub them well with a  vegetable brush, then slice them into thick slices. Add garbanzos, raisins,  yams, tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook a couple of minutes. Make a well in  the center of the mixture in the pot. Put the rice in the well and pat it  down until its wet. Cover and cook until rice is done\(emabout 25 minutes.  Add Tabasco sauce to taste. I find that the flavors of the vegetables dont  stand out unless you put in a lot of tabasco. But then, Ive got a  cast-iron tongue. You should add enough to make the stew seem spicy to you.  Difficulty: easy. Time: 15 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.  Precision: no need to measure.    Posted to recipelu-digest by jecraig@lan-inc.com on Feb 9, 98
