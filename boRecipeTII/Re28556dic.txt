Tex-Mex Hot Rice
Ripe tomatoes, chopped, Large onion, finely chopped, Uncooked rice, Ground mild or hot red chile, Chicken stock, boiling, Salt, Lard or bacon drippings, 
Rince the rice well with several washings of cold water. Heat the lard or  bacon drippings in a large heavy skillet. Add the rice and stir until it  becomes brown. Add the onion and cook until it is golden. Add the tomatoes,  boiling stock, salt, and chile. Add chile 1 Tbsp at a time, tasting after  each addition. Add more salt if you prefer the rice saltier. Steam until  rice is fluffy, about 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, check doneness and cook  a bit more if needed.
