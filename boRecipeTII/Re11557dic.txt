For Honey-Almond Parfait:  =========================         Place the outer ring of an 8-inch springform pan on a flat serving  plate; put it in a freezer.         Whip 1/2 cup of the cream until stiff; refrigerate.         In the top of a double boiler or mixer bowl that fits snugly into a  saucepan, whisk together egg, egg yolk, honey and vanilla seeds. Place  this container over a pan of boiling water and whisk vigorously until  lightly thickened, 5 to 7 minutes.         Remove from heat and continue beating until thick and completely  cooled.         Fold in the almonds and reserved whipped cream.  Pour the mixture  into the chilled springform mold.  Dip a finger in cold water and run it  around the top rim of the mixture, forming clean edge.  Return it all to  the freezer.    For Raspberry Parfait:  ======================         Coarsely mash 14 ounces of raspberries in food mill, processor or  with the back of a large wooden spoon.  Place the fruit in a saucepan with  1/3 cup of sugar and bring the mixture to a boil.  Boil gently, stirring  often, for 5 minutes. Strain the cooked fruit mixture to eliminate any  seeds.  Transfer to a shallow bowl and cool in a freezer or refrigerate.         Meanwhile whip 1 cup of cream until stiff; refrigerate.         Beat egg whites until they form soft peaks; then gradually add 1/2  cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff and shiny.  Partially fold in  thge cooked raspberry puree and framboise; add whipped cream and gently  fold until blended.  Pour the mixture over the honey-almond layer in the  springform mold, smoothing the top with a spatula.  Freeze for several  hours or overnight.    For Raspberry Sauce:  ====================         In a saucepan, combine all of the sauce ingredients except lemon  juice. Bring to a boil, then boil gently, stirring, for about 7 minutes.  Reduce the heat and stir in the lemon juice.  Keep warm.         To garnish, remove parfait from freezer.  Carefully release  springform ring (if difficult, warm ring slightly with your palms).  Whip 1/2 cup cream until stiff; form decorative border or rosettes  around the top and bottom edges of the parfait by piping whipped cream  through a pastry bag fitted with a star tip.  Arrange 2 raspberries and 2  or 3 almond slices on top of each serving.  Cut into wedges.  Serve with  warm raspberry sauce, if desired.
