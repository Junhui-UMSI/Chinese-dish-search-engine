I used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat bread  recipe in the DAK today. It turned out great. Basically, I just halved your  recipe and added a few things. My DAK is a 3 cup flour model, is yours? If  Im using whole wheat or rye flour, I can add more flour because it doesnt  rise as much. Also, whenever I use whole wheat, etc. I add vital wheat  gluten and lecithin to aid elasticity and to help it rise. This is what I  put in the DAK and the order I used: Turn the light/dark setting to 12  oclock and set the menu to Sweet Bread (the auto. one, not the manual one)  Later, at the beeps, I added 3/4 c. pecans (didnt have walnuts on hand). I  usually add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the B/M while  kneading.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 12 Jan 97, by Betsy Burtis <ebburtis@IX.NETCOM.COM>  on Mon, 13 Jan 1997.
