Combine the pumpkin, the 1/2 cup sugar, spices, and 1/2 ts of salt in a  bowl and mix well.  Add the egg yolks, stirring until well blended, then,  gradually, blend in the evaporated milk.  Pour into the unbaked pie shell.  Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F. oven for 35 minutes or until a knife  inserted halfway between the center and edge comes out clean.  Remove the  pie from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F.  To  make the meringue, beat the egg whites and the 1/8ts of salt in a bowl,  using an electric mixer set on high, until foamy.  Gradually add the 6  tbls of sugar, 1 tbls at a time, beating well after each addition.  Continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks from when the beaters are  slowly lifted.  Spoon some of the meringue around the edge of the warm  pie.  Spread the meringue so that it touches the inner edge of the crust  all the way around the pie, using the back of a spoon to do this.  Heap  the remaining meringue in the center and, again using the back of the  spoon, push it out to meet with the meringue border.  Using a flatware  knife, form light small peaks in the meringue and then bake in the  preheated oven for 5 minutes or until the meringue is lightly browned.  Cool on a wire rack.
