Tapioca Fluff Pudding
Quick-cooking tapioca, milk, Sugar, salt, Eggs, vanilla, 
In a heavy large saucepan, combine sugar, tapioca, and salt. Stir in milk  and let stand for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, beat egg yolks slightly. Stir yolks  into tapioca mixture. Bring to a full boil, stirring constantly. Remove  from heat. Stir in vanilla. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Put 1/3  of the whites into a large bowl. Slowly stir in the tapioca mixture. Fold  in remaining egg whites, leaving little fluffs of un-blended egg white.  Cover and chill. Serve topped with whipped cream or fruit.
