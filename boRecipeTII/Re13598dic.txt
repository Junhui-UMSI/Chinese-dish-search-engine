Soak plucked and cleaned goose overnight in well salted water. Rinse and  dry, then stuff with 2 onions and 2 apples, both quartered. Place breast  side up in open roaster pan and cover with 2 strips thick bacon. Brown in  475 degree oven until bacon is crisp. Take all fat from pan and discard.  Remove bacon.    Add to the pan 1 onion, quartered, 1 carrot, quartered, 1 cut up stalk of  celery, 1 bay leaf, 2 or 3 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 2 cans  consomme with 2 cans water, and 1 cup of dry red wine. Cover the pan and  roast at 375 degrees for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, basting often. Goose should be  done so that meat will readily pull off carcass.    Remove goose from roaster and place on warm platter. Remove and discard  stuffing. Strain the gravy and thicken with 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed  with 2 tablespoons cold water.  Correct seasoning if necessary. Serve with  wild rice.
