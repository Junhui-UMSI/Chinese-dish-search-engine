This versatile mixture is excellent fare for serving a casual crowd. It  makes a good filling for burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas, and is  especially convenient for last-minute suppers because it freezes well, too.  I like to roll it up in warm flour tortillas with shredded Cheddar cheese,  chopped scallions, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. Makes 8 to 10 servings  Preparation: 1. In a 5- or 6-quart electric slow cooker, mix together the  beans, hot water, tomatoes with their liquid, green chiles, garlic, cumin,  chili powder, oregano, coriander, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and beef. 2.  Cover and cook on the high heat setting 1 hour. Reduce the heat to the low  setting and cook, covered, 8 hour longer, or until the beans and beef are  tender. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
