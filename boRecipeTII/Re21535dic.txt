Apple Pie W/cider Crust
Whole wheat flour, Frozen Apple Juice, Cinnamon, Sweet Butter, FILLING, Apples, Peeled & Sliced, All-purpose flour, Salt, Apple Juice Concentrate, Crust, 
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine the apple slices, apple juice and  cinnamon in a large saucepan. Leave the saucepan uncovered. Simmer over low  heat until most of the liquid is absorbed into the apples, stirring  occasionally. The apples will be ready after about 30 minutes. Cool  slightly. Combine the white and whole wheat flours and salt in a bowl.  Combine 1/3 of the mixture with enough of the apple juice to form a paste.  Cut the butter into the remaining flour mixture until it resembles coarse  meal. Stir in the paste. Form a soft dough but do not knead. Roll out half  the dough and fit into the (9") Pie Plate. Fill with the cooked apples.  Roll out the remaining dough and form a top crust. Place the top crust over  the filling and press the edges together with a fork. Prick a few vents in  the top crust. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375  degrees. Bake until golden brown (15-20 minutes). Serve warm, at room  temperature or cold. Excellent with sharp cheddar or vanilla ice cream.
