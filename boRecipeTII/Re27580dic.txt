Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Mix  flour through nutmeg in medium bowl; set aside.    Beat butter in large bowl of electric mixer or with handheld mixer at  medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add brown sugar,  increase speed to medium-high, and beat until combined and fluffy, about 1  minute longer. Add eggs one at a time, beating thoroughly before adding the  next. Beat in vanilla, molasses, and sour cream until thoroughly combined  and creamy, about 1 minute longer. Reduce speed to low; beat in buttermilk  and half the flour mixture until combined, about 1 minute. Beat in  remaining flour mixture until incorporated and slightly curdled looking,  about 1 minute longer, scraping sides of bowl as necessary. Stir in bran  and raisins.    Spray a twelve mold muffin tin (each mold measuring 1/2 cup) or a six mold  muffin tin (each mold measuring one cup) with cooking spray or coat lightly  with butter; divide batter evenly among molds using spoon or ice cream  scoop. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center withdraws cleanly or  with a few moist particles adhering to it, about 25 minutes. Set on wire  rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove muffins from tin and serve  warm.    Cooks Notes: Wheat bran is available at health foods stores or in boxes,  labeled Quaker Unprocessed Bran, in supermarkets.
