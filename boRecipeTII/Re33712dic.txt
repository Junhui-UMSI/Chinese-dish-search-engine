Now for a little recipe from the Upperline Restaurant in uptown New Orleans  I think yall might like.    Heat butter in saute pan, add garlic and shake pan until garlic is nicely  brown.  TAKE CARE NOT TO BURN.  Sprinkle with sugar and shake to coat. Add  vinegar and water, cover and simmer a few minutes until almost tender.  Remove lid and turn up to high shaking garlic until liquid is absorbed.  Sprinkle with salt. Good at room temp.
