Pumpkin Cookies
Ground cinnamon, Flour, Brown sugar (packed), Salt, Margarine or butter, Eggs, Vanilla, Pumpkin (canned), Chopped pecans (optional), Baking Powder, Ground nutmeg, Raisin  (optional), 
Cream the margarine and sugar together. Add eggs and beat thoroughly. Mix  in vanilla and pumpkin. Combine the dry ingredients and add to creamed  mixture. Stir in raisins or pecans if used.    Bake 2" apart on paper lined(baking paper) sheet tray or lightly greased  cookie sheet.  Use well rounded table spoon and then flatten each cookie a  little with the bottom of a glass that was dipped in sugar to keep from  sticking.    Conventional Oven: 350 degrees until lightly browned.    Convection Oven:  325 degrees until lightly browned.    These baking times are just a guide line.  You should do what works best  for your oven.  Enjoy!    These cookies should be soft and chewy. entered recipe on 11-21-96kwc  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V5 #008 by kwcochran@juno.com (Keith W Cochran)  on Jan 8, 1998
