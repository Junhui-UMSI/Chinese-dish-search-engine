Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 30 minutes     1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking pan.     2. With an electric mixer, cream the butter, granulated sugar, eggs and  vanilla until light, 2 minutes. Add the chocolate and mix well. Stop the  mixer and fold in the flour then the nuts.     3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake just until a toothpick inserted  in the center comes out clean, 30 minutes. Cool completely.     4. For the filling, mix all ingredients until smooth. Spread in an even  layer over the cooled brownies.     5. For the glaze, melt chocolate with butter; mix well. Pour over filling  and gently tilt pan so glaze covers the entire surface. Refrigerate until  glaze is set; cut into squares or sticks. For holiday cookie trays, cut the  brownies into small squares and decorate them with holiday finery.
