FROM:      Derek Maddox (The Tally System - 912-328-6183 - (1:36)    Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 350F. Lightly butter  baking sheets. In a double boiler over hot - not simmering - water, melt  the butter and 8 ounces of the white chocolate, stirring frequently. Set  aside and let cool until tepid.    In a large bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Beat in the sugars  until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Blend in the tepid  white chocolate mixture and the vanilla.    In a double boiler over simmering water, melt the cream cheese, stirring  occasionally. Blend into the white chocolate mixture. In a medium bowl,  combine the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon; blend into the white  chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining white chocolate, semisweet  chocolate, and hazelnuts. Spoon by heaping tablespoonfuls, two inches  apart, onto the prepared pans and bake until golden brown and firm to the  touch, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the cookies to wire racks and cool  completely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.    Source: "White Chocolate," by Janice Wald Henderson    Creator: Ann M.
