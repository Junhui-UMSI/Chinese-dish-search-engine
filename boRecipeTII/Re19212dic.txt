Cover the rice with boiling water and leave to soak for several hours.  Drain, rinse, cover with water, add a little salt and the tumeric, bring to  the boil, then lower heat, and cook until the water is absorbed and rice  tender, about 20 minutes.    Meanwhile, chop the beans and carrot. Steam them -- and the peas -- until  just tender.  Drain and set aside.    Chop the onion.  Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely. Chop the  tomato.    Heat the margarine in a pan and add the onion.  Saute until beginning to  brown.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a minute longer.   Lower heat and stir in the spices.  Then add the tomato and cook for a  minute longer.  Remove from heat and stir in the cooked vegetables.    Place half the cooked rice on the bottom of a greased ovenproof dish, spoon  the vegetable mixture over it, then top with the other half of the rice.  Cover the dish (if it has no lid then use foil) and bake it at 350 degrees  F (180 C) Gas Mark 4 for about half an hour.    Toast the almonds under a hot grill (broiler) until lightly browned. When  the pilau is ready and dished up, sprinkle the almonds on top.    * Source: The Single Vegan - by Leah Leneman * Typed for you by Karen  Mintzias
