Persimmon Pudding
Persimmons, Flour (more or less), Eggs, Butter, Nutmeg, Sugar, Ground cinnamon, Sweet milk, 
Wash Persimmons, and mash.  Rub through a sieve. (Larry note: I recommend  using  a "Foley Foodmill") ADD well beaten eggs, sugar, sweet milk, and the  butter, which  has been cut into small pieces, and the spices. Add enough  flour to make a stiff batter. Bake in a moderately hot oven. Serve with  whipped cream.
