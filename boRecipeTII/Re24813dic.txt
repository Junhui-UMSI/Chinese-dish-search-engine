Aunt Mariettas Corn Soup
See directions, 
Cut corn from cobs, boil cobs to make stock. Make roux, add onions, garlic,  ham, green pepper, corn, and fry.  Add tomatoes and cook down. Add stock  and seasoning. We make this every year with the latter part of the corn  crop, since the corn doesnt have to be too tender. We never have written  down proportions. Instead of ham, I now use a little olive oil. We also add  shrimp or crawfish, and sometimes we use only a little liquid and add  butter beans, and serve it as a vegetable    Recipe By     : DDMom    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
