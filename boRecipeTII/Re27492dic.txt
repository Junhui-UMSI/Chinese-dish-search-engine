Heat 2 cups of water in a small saucepan to simmering, and add one and half  cups of sugar slowly dissolving it, then simmering to thicken it to a  smooth syrup (you can always use a commercial sugar syrup or even Maple  syrup if you prefer). Add one teaspoon of prik pon (ground dried red prik  ki nu chilis), and a pinch of salt. Set aside to cool.    Shell and clean the tamarinds, and then leave them to soak in the sugar  syrup for several hours before putting on a rack to dry. (beware that  tamarinds have stones in them...)    Though similar this is not the same as the candy that started this thread,  which is made from tamarind paste and involves a fairly complex "toffee  making" process (I rang my wife to check - she doesnt know more than  that).
