Thanks to everyone who has posted fig recipes-- havent tried any yet, but  they sound good. I did find a website with info and recipes about figs  (http://www.californiafigs.com), but also whipped up some very good fig  apple bran muffins.    Preheat oven to 400 F. Combine cereal and apple juice in large bowl. Let  stand as you peel, core, and grate apple and chop figs. Add both along with  oil and apple sauce. Sift dry ingredients into mixtue and stir to make  batter. Fill cups of oiled muffin pan or baking cups and bake about 18  minutes. Muffins are done when toothpick inserted into center comes out  clean.    Between the figs and the bran, these are high in fiber, and with only 3 T  of oil, theyre lower in fat than the muffins on the back of the All Bran  box, and very tasty. Theyre not dry or bland, but for an even sweeter  muffin without additional fat, you could whip up a simple glaze with 1/2 c  powdered sugar, 1/2 T vanilla extract and 1 T skim milk. Just whisk them  together and pour over the muffins. Enjoy! Posted to EAT-L Digest by Nolan  Richardson <elemeno-p@USA.NET> on Aug 3, 1997
