Pilsner Urquell
Light dry malt extract, Yeast, Extract syrup, Wyeast 2007 Bohemian Pilsner, Saaz hops, 
Bring extracts and 2 gallons of water to boil. Add 5 AAUs of Saaz  hops at  beginning of boil. Add 5 AAUs again at 30 minutes and at 10 minutes. Pitch  yeast when cool. The yeast I used produced a very clean, clear beer and Id  recommend  it highly. It you havent gotten into liquid yeast cultures yet,  do it  for this batch. The difference is tremendous. Also I feel the key to  success here are: The lightest extract you can find. Fresh hops or pellets  packed in Nitrogen (only Saaz will do). Liquid yeast fermented at a steady  low temp. Original Gravity: 1.050 Final Gravity: 1.010--1.008 Primary  Ferment: 50 degrees    Recipe By     : Don McDaniel    From: Emory!a4450gh.Esr.Hp.Com!garhow@sdate: Mon, 21 Mar 94 16:05:59 Est    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
