Praline Filling
Almonds, 
Make the vanilla custard cream. Place the sugar and nuts in a heavy  saucepan and place over medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon.  It will take a while for the sugar to melt becauce there is no water or  other liquid in the pot. Keep on stirring! As soon as the sugar melts, it  will turn into caramel. Immediately remove from heat and pour the caramel  onto an oiled marble slab (if you have one) or onto an oiled cookie sheet  (if you dont). Allow it to cool. When the candy has cooled, it will be  hard and brittle. Break it into pieces, place the pieces in your blender or  food processor, and grind them up into powder. Fold the praline powder into  the vanilla custard cream.
