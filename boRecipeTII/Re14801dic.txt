The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra  knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a lighter  loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset the machine  and start again.  Some manufacturers produce home bakeries with a whole  wheat cycle; if your machine doesnt have one, this start- again method  works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS: The gluten gives the whole  wheat flour the structure necessary for a good loaf. If your market doesnt  stock wheat gluten, try your local health food store. Remember the extra  knead.  Its especially important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the  extra knead, us this recipe only on the regular bake cycle.
