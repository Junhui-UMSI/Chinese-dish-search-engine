B/m-Eggnog Bread
Nutmeg, Active dry yeast, Eggnog; at room temp.*, Butter, All-purpose flour, Salt, Sugar, 
I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for the  eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may need to make  adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with it, if it looks  too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too dry, add liquid, also one  tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!    * Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in    the microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your manufacturers  directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as needed This made a  real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of my breadmaker. I used the  SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness or darkness button slightly  lighter than the center mark (I have a Welbilt). Let me know your results,  we sure enjoyed it!
