Peaches Cardinal Hume
Granulated sugar, Vanilla pod, Caster sugar, Raspberries, Peaches, fresh, Water, 
Put the granulated sugar into a saucepan large enough to hold the peaches.  Add the water and the vanilla pod and bring to the boil, gently to begin  with, stirring until the sugar dissolves. When simmering put in the  peaches. Bring back to simmering point and very gently poach for 8 minutes.  Remove the peaches and peel while still warm. The syrup can be bottled and  used t o poach other fruits. Put the peaches in a beautiful glass dish and  chill.    Liquidise the raspberries with the caster sugar and pass through a sieve if  you wish to get rid of the pips. When ready to eat, pour the red puree over  the succulent peaches. Decorate with mint leaves dragged through icing  sugar.    formatted by suechef@sover.net    Recipe by: Two Fat Ladies #FL1A03    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #797 by Sue <suechef@sover.net> on Sep 22,  1997
