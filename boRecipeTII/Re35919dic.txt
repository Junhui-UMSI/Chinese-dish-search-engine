From: Lillian Duvall Kepp <thekepps@brutus.bright.net>    Date: Tue,  3 Sep 96 22:43:42 PDT  I dont like mushrooms, but I do make stuffed mushrooms for the holidays.  What I need to know, is there a particular chile that goes best with  mushrooms?  I would like to substitute chiles for the "green bell pepper."    Here is the recipe I use.    Remove tops of mushrooms, chop stems. Cook bacon in skillet, remove bacon  when done, and add green pepper and onion to bacon grease.  Saute until  done. Drain. Crumble bacon. Combine bacon, green pepper, onion, mushroom  stems, salt, cream cheese, and Worcestershire sauce. Fill mushroom caps.  Combine melted butter, bread crumbs and parsley. Press top of each mushroom  into bread crumb mixture. Bake about 20 min. at 350 degrees.    Any ideas on what would be the best chile to give the mushrooms a little  zing and still keep the flavor of the mushrooms.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #093    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
