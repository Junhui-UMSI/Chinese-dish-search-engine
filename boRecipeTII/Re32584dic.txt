Sweet Milk
Raisins, Reconstituted nonfat milk, 
It should be made at least one day in advance of use, but reaches peak  sweetness after two or three days. Combine milk and raisins in a jar,  cover and refrigerate at least overnight. Before using, shake the jar  vigorously. Milk should be an ivory color. Strain the milk to remove  the raisins which will be mushy and a little flat tasting. Use milk  as directed <in recipe>.
