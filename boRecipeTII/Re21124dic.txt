Add onions and  garlic and sauted until onions are golden brown (about 10 minutes).  Remove  from heat.  Stir in mustard.  Season generously with pepper.  Let stand at  room temperature.    Dough: Combine first four ingredients in bowl.  Stir until yeast dissolves.  Mix in oil.  Gradually add enough flour to form soft dough.  Knead dough on  lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if  sticky, (about 8 minutes). Cover and lets stand 30 minutes.    Preheat oven to 450 F.  Oil 16-inch pizza pan (or 2 12-inch pans).  Roll  dough to fit pan and transfer to pan.  Spread onion mixture over dough.    Topping: Bake until cheeses melt and crusts are golden brown (about 20  minutes) Let cool 5 minutes.  Cut into wedges and serve    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
