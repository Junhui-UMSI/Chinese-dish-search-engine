Pineapple Upside Down Cheesecake
THANKSGIVING, (S) AGO, Contributed by Bobby Edwards, That I made a few, 
1 (6-8 oz.) can pineapple tidbits      1/2    cup brown sugar 2 (8 oz.) pkgs. cream cheese 4 eggs 1 cup white  sugar 1 tsp. vanilla      1/2    tsp. salt    In 9-inch round cake pan (it MUST be non-stick, and sprayed with  non-flavored cooking spray), crumble brown sugar in bottom of pan. Add  pineapple and juice evenly over brown sugar. Set aside. In blender or food  processor, blend eggs, white sugar, vanilla, and salt until well mixed.  With blender or processor still running, drop in pieces of cream cheese  until all of it is used. Blend until completely smooth. Pour cream cheese  mixture evenly over pineapple mixture in the cake pan in beginning of this  recipe. Place cake pan in slightly larger pan which contains about 1/4 inch  of water. Do not allow this water to get in the cream cheese mixture. Place  pans in pre-heated 350 degree oven for 55-60 minutes, or until center of  cheesecake is firm. When done, wait until cool before turning out onto  serving plate. Since the bottom becomes the top, this cheesecake has no  crust.
