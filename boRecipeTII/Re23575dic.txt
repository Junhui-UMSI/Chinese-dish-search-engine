Combine the rice, water, sugar and salt in a large saucepan. Bring the  water to a boil and cover the saucepan. Reduce the heat to low and continue  to cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed. Combine the milk  and egg yolks. Add them to the rice. Then mix in the raisins, vanilla and  cinnamon. Simmer for five minutes. Remove from the heat. Beat the egg  whites until stiff. Fold them into the rice. Chill and garnish with nutmeg  before serving. NOTE: I like rice pudding warm, too.

Theyre not hard, and  theyre sure tasty.  :)    Food & Wine RT [*] Category 5, Topic 9 Message 65 Sat Dec 12, 1992 PETCHY  [Court.Jester]        at 13:04 EST    MM by QBTOMM and Sylvia Steiger, GEnie THE.STEIGERS, CI$ 71511,2253, GT  Cookbook echo moderator, net/node 004/005
