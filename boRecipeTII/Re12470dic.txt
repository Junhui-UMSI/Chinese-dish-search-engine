Green pepper -- finely, Whole white onion -- grated, Chopped, Whole potatoes, Paprika -- to taste, Fresh parsley -- minced, Butter, 
Peel potatoes and grate them into cold water. Let stand for 5 minutes.  Drain and squeeze all liquid from potatoes. Spread on clean toweling to  dry.    Melt 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet, add onion and pepper, and saute for  two minutes. Add the potatoes. Sprinkle thickly with paprika, cover  tightly, and cook over very low heat for 15 minutes. Check occasionally to  be sure the potatoes are not sticking to the bottom of the pan, but do not  stir. Add extra butter, if needed, by lifting potatoes carefully with a  spatula and pour melted butter under them. Carefully slide potatoes onto a  warm plate. Melt remaining butter in skillet and invert potatoes into  skillet. Continue to cook another 10 minutes, until done.
