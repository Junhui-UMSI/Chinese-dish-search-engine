Mix two packets of yeast in 2 cups of tepid water and let sit for ten  minutes.  Add 1/2 cup salad oil.   Add Olive oil, 3 cups flour; cornmeal  and salt.  Knead for about ten minutes. Add 2-1/2 cups of additional flour.  Knead this for 15 minutes.  Let dough rise to twice its size. Use blackened  deep dish pizza pans. Im not sure how you get em blackened - I cured mine  with olive oil and then I just wipe them out when Im done. They are kind  of getting blackened looking with use. I have two pans and make two pizzas  at a time. I spread the pan with olive oil and sprinkle with cornmeal.  Divide the dough in half. Spread and cover the bottom of the pan. Spread it  up the sides.  I then let it rise again in the pan. Cover pizza dough with  sliced mozzarella. Drain and squash a 28 ounce can of plum tomatoes for  each pizza.  Drain off the excess fluid after squashing, and spread this  over the cheese. Smidge of salt and ground pepper over the top. Chopped  garlic, fresh chopped basil and oregano. Add the filling of your choice (I  use sliced onion and Italian Sausage). Top with a Parmesan/Romano Cheese  mix. Bake in preheated oven at 475 degrees for 35-40 minutes. ~--
