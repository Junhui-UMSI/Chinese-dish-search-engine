Vegetable oil, Sugar, About 500 grams self raising, X-Large eggs, 
Beat eggs, oil and sugar together very well. Add flour slowly to make soft  dough.    Let stand for 20 mins covered.    Flour board very well and take small pieces of dough and roll them very  thin. I use a large biscuit cutter to cut them otherwise they can be cut  diamond shaped. Prick them with a fork, brush with oil and sprinkle with  sugar.    Bake at 210 until slightly browned. This takes about 5 minutes and they  have to be watched as they burn very easily.    Remove from cooler and bake the next lot keeping the oven hot all the time.  I actually use 2 cooling trays.
