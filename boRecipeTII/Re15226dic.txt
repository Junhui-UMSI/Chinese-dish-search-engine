Whipped Raspberry Soup
Raspberries; washed &, Honey, 
One of my Northwest Indian friends tells me that his grandmother used to  make this dish for him when he was tiny, but she used oolichan grease or  fish oil with the raspberries rather than honey. I expect that you would  prefer this dessert with honey. No, I have not tried it with fish oil  either. Place the berries in an electric mixing bowl along with the honey.  Mash the berries and then whip them until they are light. Chill well before  serving. This is a very delicious conclusion to your Northwest Indian  dinner.
