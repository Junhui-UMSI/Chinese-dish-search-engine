Beef Jerky #2 (My Favorite)
Pepper, Garlic salt, Lemon Pepper, Garlic powder, Beef Roast, Soy sauce, Onion salt, 
Marinate 1 hour or overnight.  Bake in oven 150 to 170, overnight for 10 -  12 hours.  Leave Oven door open to allow moisture to escape. Check often  for proper level of dryness.    If you have a smoker, jerky may be dried in smoker.  Keep the heat low and  again check dryness of jerky often.
