Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Slice the tops off all the bell peppers  and set aside. Remove the seeds and membranes. Dice the second measure of  red bell peppers. Combine the diced red bell pepper and the ground veal  (you may substitute ground chicken for the veal). Add the green onions, the  Jalapeno peppers and the garlic. Stir in the soft cream cheese and blend in  with a wooden spoon. Stir in the egg and the half & half. Add the grated  cheese. Season with the cumin, salt and pepper. Place the pepper shells in  a baking dish which will hold them snugly together. Spoon the filling into  the peppers. Replace the tops. Pour several (3-4) tablespoons of water  around the peppers. Bake until the filling is puffed and the peppers are  soft (about 40 minutes). Serve at once.
