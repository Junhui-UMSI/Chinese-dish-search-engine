Banana Bran Muffins
Flour, milk, Brown Sugar, Egg, Whole bran cereal, Banana, Salt, Baking Powder, Cooking oil, Cloves, 
Here is one that I like (so do my boys.)  Found in the Muffin Cookbook  2nd edition Published by the Save-easy Food Stores.     In large bowl, stir together cereal, milk and banana.  Let stand 2 minutes  or until cereal is soft.  Add oil and egg; mix well.  Stir dry ingredients  into bran mixture only until moistened.  Spoon into greased muffin cups.  Bake at 375F for 25 to 30 minutes. Yields 6 large or 12 normal size  muffins.    JAF@JUPITER.SUN.CSD.UNB.CA    (J ANTHONY FITZGERALD)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
