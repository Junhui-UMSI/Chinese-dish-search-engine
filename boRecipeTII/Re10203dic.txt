Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet over low heat. Slowly add  grated cheddar cheese, liqueur (optional) and garlic. Continue to add  remaining cheese until the fondue is warmed thoroughly and is a smooth,  creamy sauce. If mixture looks too thin, add 2-3 Tbs. all-purpose flour to  a small amount of cold milk and stir until smooth, then slowly add to sauce  while stirring constantly to avoid lumping.    For dipping French Bread, tear or cut fresh bread into bite size chunks.  Heat bread cubes in a 350-F degrees oven for 5 to 8 minutes to toast. To  prepare meats or sausages for dipping, heat and cut into bite sized pieces.  To prepare vegetables for dipping, slightly cook in any fashion, being  careful not to overcook because the pieces will slip off the fondue fork.  Select the vegetables of your choice and prepare cubes or in small pieces.  Raw vegetables may also be utilized for dipping. Present fondue with  dippers and utilize fondue forks for dipping.    For serving, place dippers in individual bowls or creatively arrange on a  serving platter or tray. Preparation time varies with selected dippers.  Both sauce and dippers can be prepared 1-day in advance and re-heated for  serving. A small crock pot may be utilized for re-heating the fondue at  serving time.
