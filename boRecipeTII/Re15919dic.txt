Betty Bernard.    "These cookies can be frozen or stored in the pantry. They are not fragile  and withstand the rigors of shipping."    Submitted by Suzy-Q Lewis    In a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer, beat together shortening and  brown sugar. Add egg and contnue beating until ingredients are well  blended.    Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add flour  mixture to shortening mixture, stirring to keep batter well blended. Add  walnuts, chocolate morsels, coconut, raisins and bananas; mix well.  Gradually stir in oats, mixing well.    Drop dough from end of teaspoon onto lightly greased baking sheets. Bake in  a preheated 375 deg oven 12 minutes or until done.    TIP: To save time spent baking, drop batter on cookie sheet lined with  heavy-duty aluminum fo8il. When done and slightly cooled, cookies will  "peel" off the foil. Liner can be used again, or having two or three foil  liners ready with cookie batches for baking will hasten the baking time  considerably.
