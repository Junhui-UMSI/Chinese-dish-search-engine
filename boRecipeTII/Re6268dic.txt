Thai preference would be to gut and clean the fish, but leave the head on.  You may of course prefer to remove the head, even to use fish fillets...    cut three or four slashes in the sides of the cleaned fish, and sprinkle  with the rice wine. Dust liberally with the flour, and deep fry in hot oil  until crispy.    Meanwhile, in a saucepan, or second wok, add a little oil to the hot pan,  and stir fry the chilis and onions until fragrant. Add the fish sauce, and  bring to a gentle boil. Stir in the sugar and continue stirring until the  sugar is dissolved. add the coriander leaves, and stir occasionally until  the sauce is slightly reduced (about 5 minutes).    Remove from the heat, and transfer to a sauce jug. Add the basil leaves  when cool.    The fish, on a serving platter, and accompanied with a basket of khao niao  (sticky rice), and the jug of sauce is presented to the diners, with the  usual Thai table condiments (notably nam pla prik - chilis in fish sauce).    Normally diners break off small pieces of the fish with chopsticks and  transfer them to their plate, make the morsel into a ball with a little  sticky rice and dip it into the sauce before transfering it to the mouth  with the right hand... left handed diners and those feeling more  comfortable could of course use a fork and spoon...
