There should be equal amounts cumin and black mustard seeds, and plenty  more sesame seeds.  Only a little lemon juice - it has a strong flavor.  Cayenne has an _extremely_ intense flavor, so use it judiciously. Heat some  oil in a pan.  When hot, throw in all the seeds. When the black mustard  seeds begin popping, throw in the potatoes and other spices. Cook until the  potatoes are as done as you like them.    This also comes from Madhur Jaffrey.
