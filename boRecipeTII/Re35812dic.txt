Add 1  tablespoon good curry powder, 1 tablespoon dried chinese mustard, and 2-3  dried habs, crushed, and fresh ground black pepper. (amounts are according  to personal taste). Mash together with a fork, adding enough ranch salad  dressing to make a moist, smooth filling. Refill the eggs, garnish with a  sprig of cilantro/lemon basil/parsley, and a sprinkle of paprika.
