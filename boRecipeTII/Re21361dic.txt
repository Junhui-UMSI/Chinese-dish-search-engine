Underground Soup (With Donnas Additions in Brackets)
Garlic, Sweet potatoes [1 big one],, Celery root [1 big one--I, Chicken Stock, Carrots, Onions, Rutabega [one large one],, Parsnips [two small ones], 
Sautee onions and garlic in olive oil for about 30 minute (it takes that  long to chop the other stuff). Add remaining ingredients (except stock).  Add chicken stock [I used onion soup powder and parev chicien powder] and  bring to a boil. Let simmer (you can let simmer for hours the longer the  better) add pepper and taragon to taste and it is wonderful. I always get  compliments on it.    originally posted by whoever lives at Lupovitch@aol.com    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #57    Date: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 14:04:56 -0700 (PDT)    From: dkuttner@proaxis.com (Donna Holberg Kuttner)
