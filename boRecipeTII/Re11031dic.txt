I used to use the tomato basil Ragu Light, which used to be labelled as fat  free (although I havent found it recently). It was totally vegan (even  listed "natural vegetable flavorings" on the label. I think they may have  changed the formula as the ones Ive seen in the store recently are  labelled as lowfat not fat free. At any rate, plain pasta sauce is SO easy  to make yourself and only takes as long as the noodles take to cook. Here  is how I make mine:    Simmer until heated through. Tomato paste will thicken the sauce. You may  want to add it 1 T. at a time so you get the desired thickness. This is  really tasty, super quick, and totally fat free. If you want other stuff in  it, just steam some veggies in the microwave (or use leftovers out of the  refrigerator) and add them to the sauce.
