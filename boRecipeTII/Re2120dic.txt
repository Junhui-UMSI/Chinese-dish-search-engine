Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray PAM onto springform pans.    2. Cream margarine and sugar in a bowl. Add the flour, baking powder,  vanilla, salt, eggs, and beat well.    3. Spoon the batter into a spring form pan of 8, 9, or 10 inches. Place  apples into the batter in a circular pattern. Sprinkle sugar/cinnamon over  top. Keep the sugar/cinnamon away from the edge of the baking tin to avoid  having it carmelize and burn.    4. Bake for one hour. Test with a toothpick to see that its baked. Remove  and cool. Refrigerate or freeze. To serve a tort that was frozen, heat to      300    degrees briefly.    Yield: 8 servings.    Variations:    1. Use 24 halves, pitted purple Italian plums; place plums skin side up.  Use almond flavor in place of vanilla. Also sprinkle top with sugar only  when using plums or you can leave out the sugar(I leave it out).    2. Use blueberries and blueberry preserve or peaches and peach preserve.    3. Use combination of apple and cranberries as topping.    4. Try other fruits.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by NSherma@aol.com on Aug 24, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
