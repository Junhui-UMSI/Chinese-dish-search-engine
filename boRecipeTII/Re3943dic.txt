First, roast your soup bones for 45 minutes at 325 degrees. Remove from  oven and put into 6 quarts water along with the rest of the stock  ingredients. Boil gently for about 45 minutes, skimming off the scum that  rises to the top.    While the stock is boiling, soak the dried shiitakes in warm water for 30  minutes, then drain and coarsely chop. Also chop 3 cloves of elephant  garlic fine, heat three-quarters of a cup of peanut oil to 375 degrees, and  fry the chopped garlic until golden brown. Remove and set aside; chop one  small yellow onion fine, add half to the hot oil, and fry this until it too  is golden brown. Set aside.    When the stock is done strain it, return the liquid to the pot, and add  your cracked chipotle peppers, shiitake mushrooms, 10 dried tomatoes, black  pepper, black bean sauce, oyster sauce, nuoc mam, worcestershire sauce, and  four cups of warm water. Add the chopped yellow onion you did not fry,  press one head (about 10-15 cloves) of regular garlic in, and bring to a  gentle boil for 45 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally.    About 10 minutes before serving reduce to a simmer, add the fried elephant  garlic and fried yellow onion, and cover. Enjoy!
