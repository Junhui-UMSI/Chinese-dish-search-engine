Pipian Paste (Pumpkin Seed Paste)
Pasilla chiles (dry) seeded, Pumpkin seeds, Ancho or Mulato chiles (dry), White onion chopped, Peanut butter, Peanut oil, Cinnamon, Sesame seeds, Cumin ground, Hot chicken stock or beer, 
Something I concocted this weekend. I made monkfish enchiladas with this:    Place chiles in a glass bowl. Cover with boiling water for 10-15 minutes to  reconstitute. Drain. Puree in blendor or food processor or molcajete.  Reserve    Toast pumpkin seeds. Toast sesame seeds. Grind them finely. Add these with  other dry ingredients to chile puree.    Saute onions in peanut oil til nearly caramelized. Add chilepaste & peanut  butter.  Saute for 10-15 minutes, adjusting fluid with chicken stock or  beer as needed.    Use as an enchilada sauce or use as a base to cook chicken, fish, shrimp,  pork, venison in a guisado.pipian.    "Theodore B.
