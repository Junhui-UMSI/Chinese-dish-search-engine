* (Original resceipe calls for rind and juice of 1 lemon)    ** - We use three chicken bouillon cubes to 3 cups of boiling water.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    Rinse the burgal (AKA as bulgar) in a fine strainer and let drain.    In a large skillet, heat the margarine and the oil, add the chicken, and  brown the pieces on all sides. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and  remove it to a large casserole.    Add the onions and the garlic to the skillet, and cook the vegetables,  stirring them until the onions are translucent. Add the burgal (AKA bulgar)  to the skillet, stirring to coat it and brown it lightly. Add the cardamom,  coriander, cumin and lemon juice to the burgal (AKA bulgar) mixture, mixing  the ingredients in. Spoon the burgal (AKA bulgar) on top of the reserved  chicken.    Pour the boiling broth over the chicken and burgal (AKA bulgar). Cover the  casserole, and bake for 1 hour or until the chicken is tender.    NOTE - More burgal can be used, and we normally do. All that is required is  that one adjust the broth and spices proportionaltly.
