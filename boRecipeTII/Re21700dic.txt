Form dough into a flat rectangular shape. Wrap in plastic  wrap. Refrigerate for 20 minutes.    Apple Filling: In a large bowl, toss sliced apples with lemon juice. Set  aside.    Assembly: Preheat oven to 425F. On a heavily floured surface, roll out  pastry to 16x12" rectangle. Arrange pastry flat on a large baking sheet.  Overlap apple slices in 3 lengthwise rows atop pastry, leaving a 1" border  of pastry on all sides. Fold edge of pastry up to, and slightly overlapping  apples. Press together seams of pastry at corners to seal. Pinch together  and cracks in pastry along edges to hold in juices. Sprinkle apples with 2  tb sugar. Bake at 425F for 25-30 minutes until apples are tender and crust  is browned. Remove from oven and dust with 1 tb sugar, then brush with warm  glaze. Cool tart on baking sheet set on rack.
