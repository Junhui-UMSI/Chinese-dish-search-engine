This food writer, Daniel Rogov, is known for printing a lot of  non-kosher recipes (to the dismay of a lot of JP readers), so I will spare  you the French recipe (which uses goat cheese!). In all cases, Ive changed  butter to margarine and converted the metric measures to English  approximations. These can be good anytime, but Im thinking ahead to Rosh  Hashana.    The writer notes: "Despite their drawbacks, even mass-produced chickens can  be made tasty, and there is no better way to prepare a chicken than by  stuffing it with ingredients that complement and highlight the natural  flavor of the meat. Italians are particularly fond of stuffing their  chickens with rice and celery; the French use celery and onions; Egyptians,  Syrians and Jordanians rely heavily on the use of nuts ..."    In a mixing bowl, combine the mullard breast, bread crumbs, garlic and  parsley. Add the beaten egg and mix well. With this mixture, stuff the  chicken and then sprinkle the exterior of the bird with salt and pepper.    In a flameproof casserole dish, melt the oil and margarine and in this  saute the chicken until it is golden on all sides. Combine the tomato  puree and the chicken stock and pour over the chicken.    Cook in an oven that has been preheated to 150 C/300 F until the chicken is  tender. Serve hot.
