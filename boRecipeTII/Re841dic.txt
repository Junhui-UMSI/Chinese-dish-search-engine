Home Cured Pastrami
Salt, Saltpeter, Black pepper, Brown sugar, Mixed pickling spice, Ginger, Garlic, Dehydrated onion flakes, Beef brisket, 
*NOTE: Saltpeter (potassium nitrate) gives the characteristic red color to  cured meats and also acts as a preservative. Be not afraid of nitrates;  they are absolutely necessary for the proper cure.    Mix the Salt, saltpeter, spices and sugar together and then rub into the  Beef forcing it into the meat.    Place the seasoned meat in a plastic bag and seal tightly. Place in a tray  large enough to hold it. Refrigerate and turn the bag over once a day so  that the meat seasons evenly. Let the meat cure for seven or eight days.    Remove the meat and drain the liquid that accumulated. Save the solid  seasonings and discard the liquid. Rub the solids back into the meat. Or  discard the marinade and roll the brisket in a 1/4 cup of coarsely cracked  peppercorns.    Use a needle to run a string through the meat. Tie the ends of the string  together. Suspend the meat on the string and let it dry in a cool, dry,  breezy place or use an electric fan for 24 hours. Hang the meat in a smoker  and smoke for 3-4 hours at about 150 to 160 degrees    To prepare, cover with water and simmer until tender as for corned beef,  about 3-4 hours. The length of cooking time depends on how long it was  smoked. Or roast meat in a 300 degree oven about 3 1/2 to 4 hours, basting  frequently with the pan juices. Serve hot or chill. It will keep for 1 week  or longer stored in the refrigerator and can also be frozen.    An eye of round may be also treated this way. Goose and turkey breast are  also delicious prepared by this method.    Adapted from a number of sources. Jim Weller    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 26, 98
