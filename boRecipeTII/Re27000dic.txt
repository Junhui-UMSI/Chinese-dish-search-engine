From: The Gourmet Jewish Cook by Judy Zeidler    Soak dried mushrooms in 2 cups stock for about 30 minutes., Drain mushrooms  reserving stock. Strain stock through cheesecloth or fine sieve. Combine  with remaining stock and set aside. In large saucepan, heat oil; add leeks,  onion, potato, and garlic and saute over medium heat until tender, 5-10  minutes. Add sliced mushrooms and parsley and saute for 5-10 minutes  stirring occasionally with wooden spoon. Add reserved dried mushrooms and  stock. Bring to boil partially cover and simmer 30 minutes over low-medium  heat until mushrooms are tender. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Transfer half the soup to a food processor and puree. (I puree all the  potatoes and onions and leave all the mushrooms intact.) Return to pot and  mix well. Add sherry. Simmer until very hot. Ladle into heated soup bowls  and garnish with enoki mushrooms.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #044 by Gary Wind MD ~~ltgwind~~at;CapAccess.org>  on Feb 9, 1997.
