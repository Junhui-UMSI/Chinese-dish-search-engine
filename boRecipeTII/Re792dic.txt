Boil the unpeeled potatoes, then chill.  Peel, then shred to make 3 cups.  Add onion, salt and pepper.  Melt the butter in a 10 inch skillet. Pat  potatoes into pan, leaving about 1/2 inch around edge. Brown about 9  minutes, lowering heat if necessary.  Cut with spatula into wedges, turn,  and cook about 7 minutes more until golden brown.    Jeff From: Jeff Duke ~--    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Sep 26, 98
