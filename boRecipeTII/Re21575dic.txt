Apple Puffed Pancake
Granulated sugar, All-purpose flour, Butter or margarine, milk, Brown Sugar, Apples, Eggs, Salt, Vanilla, Ground cinnamon, 
Preheat oven to 425.    In a blender or large bowl, mix eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, salt and  cinnamon until blended. (If using an electric mixer, batter will remain  slightly lumpy.)    In the oven, melt butter in a 12-inch fluted porcelain quiche dish or a  13-by-9-inch baking dish; add apple slices and return to oven until butter  sizzles. Do not let it brown. Remove dish from oven and immediately pour  batter over apple. Sprinkle with brown sugar.    Bake in middle of oven 20 minutes or until puffed and brown. Serve  immediately.
