Clean and prepare the vegetables, chop coarsley and boil in the water for  30 mins. Leave to cool, then puree the mixture and pass it through a sieve.  Discard the vegetable debris and store the stock in a sealed container in  the frige. Note: It will keep happily for a couple of weeks, or may be  frozen for up to 3 months. I love cookbooks!!
