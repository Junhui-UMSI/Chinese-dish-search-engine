Source The classical cuisine of the Italian jews by Edda Servi-Machlin    Remove and disgard all the bruised and tough parts of the fennel and cut  into 4-6 wedges. Wash throughly and blot dry. Place garlic and oil in a  large skillet and saute until the garlic is browned. Remove garlic and add  the fennel, season with small amounts of salt and pepper and saute for  approximately 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Add water and cook over  moderate heat, tightly covered, for 10-15 minutes or until tender. Uncover  the skillet and let the liquid evaporate and the fenel acquire a nice  golden tone.    Serve hot or at room temperature.    Serves 6.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Sue & Sam Hurwitz <suesam@pipeline.com> on  Nov 13, 1998,
