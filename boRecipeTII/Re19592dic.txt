Anns Salsa for Rubios Fish Tacos
Fresh cilantro, Green Onions, Cayenne, diced green chiles, Comino seed, Salt, Jalapeno pepper, Diced tomatoes, Black pepper, PUCKETT; (HGPS48A), Garlic, 
Combine all ingredients. Place a little in blender for a few seconds on  pulse cycle, low speed, just long enough for the tomatoes to become a  little bit smaller (can also be done in food processor). Cover and  refrigerate. Flavor blends best when made 24 hours before serving.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Apr 06,  1998
