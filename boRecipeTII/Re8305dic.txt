Potato Pie Dessert (Irish)
Eggs*, Boiled potatoes, Orange extract, Almonds, pounded, Butter, Sugar, Whiskey, 
Mash the potatoes until lump-free. Separate the yolks and whites of the  eggs and beat separately; the yolks until lemon-colored, the whites until  stiff. Add the almonds, orange extract, sugar and egg yolks to the  potatoes; mix well, then add the glass of whiskey, and when combined, fold  in the egg whites. Have ready a greased and floured cake pan with a  greased piece of butcher paper/baking parchment in the bottom. (Or  alternately, prepare 2 pie crusts and fill them with the mixture.) Bake at  375F for 40-45 minutes.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/irish.zip
