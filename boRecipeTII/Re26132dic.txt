Tofu with Three Spices
Vegetable oil, Scallions; diced -or-, Diced onions, Salt, Firm tofu, Cornstarch (or arrowroot), Grated fresh ginger root, Sesame seed oil, Cold water, Garlic, Sugar (optional), Soy or shoyu sauce, 
Drain the tofu, then cut into 1 X 1 X 1/2 inch pieces.  Drain again.  Heat  a skillet or wok.  Add the oil and heat about 30 seconds.  Add the garlic,  ginger, scallions and salt.  Stir fry about 30 seconds.  Add the tofu. Stir  fry about 2 minutes.     Mix together the cornstarch, sugar, water, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Add  the mixture to the skqillet and stir well, then cook about another 30  seconds.     Serve with or over rice or noodles.     Helpful hints:    1. Ginger root is wonderful, but may not keep well in the refrigerator.  Keep it wrapped in plastic in the freezer and pull it out and grate as you  need it. It will keep a long time and is still delicious. Scallions are  best, but regular onions will do in a pinch.    2. The original recipe called for Worchester sauce and soy sauce, but I  substitute all soy, because, as well all know, Worchester contains  anchovies.
