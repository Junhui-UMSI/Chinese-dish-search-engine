DESCRIPTION: The cucumber family, to which squashes belong, probably has  the greatest diversity of shapes and sizes of any vegetable family except  the cabbages.   Its the genus Cucurbita and includes certain gourds and pumpkins, as well  as squashes. Most are trailing or climbing plants with large yellow flowers  (both male and female); the mature fruits have a thick skin and a definite  seed cavity.  "Summer squash," "Winter squash," and "Pumpkin" are not  definite botanical names. "Pumpkin," which any child can tell you is a  large vegetable used for jack-o-lanterns and pies, is applied to  longkeeping varieties of C. Moschata, C. pepo, and a few varieties of C.  maxima.  Summer squashes are eaten when they are immature; winter squashes  are eaten when mature.    Squashes are hard to confine.  A bush-type zucchini will grow well in a  tire planter if kept well watered and fertilized; a vining squash can be  trained up a fence. Summer squashes are week-stemmed, tender annuals, with  large, cucumberlike leaves and seperate male and female flowers that appear  on the same plant. Summer squash usually grows as a bush, rather than as a  vine; the fruits have thin, tender skin and are generally eaten in the  immature stage before the skin hardens. The most popular of the many kinds  of summer squashes are crookneck, straightneck, scallop, and zucchini.
