Wassail #4
Cloves, Water, Apple juice or apple cider, Sticks cinnamon, Lemons, Allspice, Sugar, Lime (optional), Oranges, 
Heat the water to boiling.  Cut the lemons and oranges (and lime if using)  in half and squeeze the juice into a separate bowl to save, throw the skins  and pulp into the boiling water.  Add spices and simmer for one hour.  Remove the cinnamon sticks and a few cloves and allspice and save to one  side. Using a slotted spoon or strainer remove the citrus peels and pulp  and the remaining spices. Return the cinnamon sticks and saved spices to  the water.  Add the apple juice or cider and return to heat. When boiling  remove from heat and add the citrus juice and sugar. Simmer very lightly  for another 10 minutes and serve. Delicious!     This recipe makes the whole house smell wonderful.  You may also save the  resulting mixture by allowing it to cool completely and returning most of  it to the jug the apple juice came in. (Make certain it is really cool  though some friends of mine lost an entire batch of wassail by pouring it  into the jug when it was too hot, the jug cracked and spilled it all over.)  You can then reheat it a cup or more at a time as needed. It will keep like  this in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
