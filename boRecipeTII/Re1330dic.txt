Drunken Strawberries
Strawberries, Liquor of choice, White chocolate, Dark chocolate, 
Another way of making dipped strawberries is to get an animal syringe  (human ones require a prescription), load with a liquor of your choice and  "inject" the berries. Then dip the berries in your choice of chocolate. To  make a "tuxedo" strawberry, melt some dark chocolate and melt some white  chocolate. Dip the "front" of the berry in white chocolate, then dip the  rest of the berry into the dark chocolate leaving a white portion in the  "front". Then add "buttons" by dipping a toothpick in the dark chocolate  and dotting the front. This is fun to do if you like playing with your  food.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Sharon H.
