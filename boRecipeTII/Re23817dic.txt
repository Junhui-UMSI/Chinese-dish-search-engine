Toast sesame seeds in a small, dry skillet over medium heat, stirring  constantly until seeds are golden, 3-4 minutes.    Blanch fresh snow peas and corn in boiling water for 30 seconds, or thaw if  frozen. Cook pasta, drain and cool. Poach chicken in simmering water in a  covered skillet until chicken is just done, about 15 to 20 minutes. Dont  overcook.    To prepare sauce, add first 7 ingredients to a blender and process on high  speed 1 minute. Add ground peanuts and process 1 minute more. In a cup,  combine oils and drizzle into blender mixture while blending at low speed.    In a large bowl combine blanched or thawed corn, cooked pasta, celery,  cilantro and 3/4 of the sauce.  Chop chicken and arrange with snow peas  over the pasta mixture. Top with remaining sauce and toasted sesame seeds.  Serve chilled or at room temperature    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #112    From the MealMaster recipe list.
