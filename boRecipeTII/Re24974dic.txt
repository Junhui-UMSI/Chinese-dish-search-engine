Dotted throughout Canada are small inns that care passionately about the  food they serve. This velvety fall soup offers a warm welcome to guests at  the Orchid Trail Inn near Wiarton, Ontario.      In large heavy saucepan, bring pumpkin and stock to a boil; reduce heat  to medium, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until tender. In a blender or  food processor, puree in batches.    In clean saucepan, combine pumpkin puree with beer; bring to boil over  medium heat, stirring often. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.    Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt butter over medium low heat, cook  onion and garlic; stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add to pumpkin  mixture; stir in cheese and simmer gently, partially covered, for 20  minutes.    Meanwhile in skillet over medium heat, cook pumpkin seeds, shaking pan  often, for 7 to 10 minutes or until golden brown and toasted.    Season soup with salt to taste. Garnish with pepper and pumpkin seeds.    SERVES: 4-6 Source: ELIZABETH BAIRD posted by Anne MacLellan
