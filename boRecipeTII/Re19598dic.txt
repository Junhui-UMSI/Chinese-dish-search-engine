Anns White Chocolate Ice Cream
Vanilla bean, slit open, Heavy cream, White chocolate, chopped, Sugar, Egg yolks, 
Scald 2 cups of the cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat, just until  the milk gives off steam and bubbles begin to form around the edge. Remove  the pan from the heat. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they  have a pale lemon hue. Add the sugar and continue to whisk until dissolved.  Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup of the scalded cream. When the mixture is  thoroughly blended, whisk it into the scalded cream in the saucepan. Add  the vanilla bean. Return the saucepan to low heat and whisk the cream  constantly for about 5 minutes, until it has thickened and reached a  temperature of 178 to 180F, as registered on an instant-read or a dairy  thermometer. Remove the pan from the heat. Remove the vanilla bean from the  pan, then whisk in the white chocolate, until it is melted and thoroughly  incorporated. Scrape out the inside of the vanilla bean with the back of a  knife and add these flecks to the pan. Whisk in the remaining cream.  Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 8  hours. Prepare the ice cream in an ice-cream maker according to  manufacturers directions. Store the ice cream in the freezer, where it has  a shelf life of about 1 week.
