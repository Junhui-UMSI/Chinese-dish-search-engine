Clean and wash squid, discarding ink sacks, heads and insides, and peel off  skins. Remove tentacles and chop fine. Mix chopped tentacles, ham, olives,  tomatoes, and parsley. Add salt to taste.    Stuff squid with the mixture and close openings with toothpicks. Heat oil  in a skillet and saute onion and garlic till onion is soft. Dust squid with  flour and fry with onion and garlic for about 30 minutes or until golden on  all sides.    VARIATION: If you want a sauce with your squid, remove the squid to a  warming oven. Then add to the skillet 1/2 cup dry white wine and 2 peeled  and finely chopped tomatoes. Continue cooking until the liquid is reduced  and you have a smooth sauce. Spoon sauce over the stuffed squid.    >From "Tapas, Wines & Good Times" by Don and Marge Foster Submitted By MARY  RIEMERMAN On 02-10-95 (0656)    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Ulrich Sahm" <uwsahm@netvision.net.il> on  Sep 23, 1998,
