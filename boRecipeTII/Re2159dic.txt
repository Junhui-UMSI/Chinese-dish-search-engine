Artis? Potato Salad (Sweet Pickles)
Mayonnaise, Egg; (fear of salmonella has, Salt, Boiled and peeled red, Celery stalks, Shallots; tops and bottoms,, Rounded teaspoon yellow, Homemade mayo, Hard boiled eggs; up to 8, Sugar, White onion, 8-oz jar sweet relish;, Salt and pepper, 
The lemon juice in this mayo is a very important taste ingredient. In fact,  I use non-fat Miracle Whip for everyday mayo purposes, and I always add a  bit of prepared mustard and lemon juice to it. It really does improve it!!    Cut up potatoes. Add mayo. Mix gently. Add vegetables, mix. Add relish,  mix. Slice half of the eggs, mix. Season to taste. Use the rest for garnish  (not just for looks. This really adds to the salad.)    We like the potatoes in large enough pieces to recognize, and bite into. As  you stir they break a little, which only adds to the dressing.    Mayonnaise    Place in a blender or processor:    Start machine.    Slowly, a little at a time, add 1 cup oil. (The choice is yours. I often  use half very light flavored olive oil, half corn or peanut.) I find that  for some very strange reason, the original plain Wesson Oil has a lot of  trouble homogenizing .    Add the juice of 1 lemon- 2 Tablespoons or a little more. (Or place in  processor at the beginning)    Makes a little over a cup. Store in fridge.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by ddmmom@popalex1.linknet.net on Sep 06,  1998,
