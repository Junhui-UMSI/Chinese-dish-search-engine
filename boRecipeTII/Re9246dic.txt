Pudding a la Reine
Cubed bread - use both brown, Whole Milk, Raisins, Butter, Miniature marshmallows, Banana, Sugar, Eggs, Egg yolks, 
Preheat your oven to 350F. Put the bread and let soak a couple of minutes  in the milk in a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar, egg yolks, marshmallows,  cut banana in slices and add, raisins. Mix this thoroughly. Pour into a  generously greased baking dish and bake for 25 minutes, or until puffed,  browned and firm in the center. To make your Meringue, it is best when put  on the pudding shortly before serving, make sure to put your pudding in the  refrigerator until serving time. And now how to make the perfect Meringue.  Put in your bowl 2 egg whites Beat with your blender or with a whisk until  in soft peaks when you lift out the beater. Beat in gradually 1/2 cup of  sugar 1 tsp. lemon juice or 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract A few grains of salt  (to taste) Spoon the Meringue evenly over your pudding but do not make it  too smooth. Spread well to the edge so that the Meringue will not shrink as  it bakes. (For a different effect, spread part of the mixture and put the  rest through a pastry bag and tube to make a pattern) Bake at 425F until  delicately brown ( approx. 5 minutes) Serve hot or cold. I am sure your  guests will enjoy this immensely.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #232 by "Lynn Ratcliffe" <mcgrew@ntr.net>  on Sep 11, 1997
