You can use either almonds or walnuts in this recipe-each gives a very  different flavor.     In a small saucepan, place apricots and cover with water. Cook, covered,  over low heat for 15 minutes. Drain, and when apricots are cool enough to  handle, chop finely. Set aside.     Preheat oven to 350?. Grease 8 x 8-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, beat  butter, sugar and 1 cup flour until well mixed and crumbly; pat into bottom  of pan. Bake 20 minutes at 350? or just until golden.     While batter is in oven, use the same bowl to mix all remaining  ingredients (including apricots) except confectioners sugar. Pour over  baked layer and return to oven for 25 minutes.     Remove from oven; cool in pan before cutting in squares or oblongs with a  sharp knife. Dust with confectioners sugar.    Yield: 16-20 squares or oblongs.
