WALDINE VAN GEFFEN VGHC42A, Arborio rice, Stock, Salt and pepper, Onions, White wine, Bunches, Boiling potatoes, olive oil, Bn kale, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Italian parsley, Butter, 
In pressure cooker or skillet, heat oil and butter. Add onions, potatoes  and kale. Saute over medium-high heat until kale wilts some and onions give  off aroma. (Can be prepared ahead to this point and kept tightly covered  and refrigerated until 15 to 20 minutes before serving.) Add rice to warm  potato-kale mixture and stir briefly, until rice turns opaque, about 1  minute. Add wine and stir until evaporated. Add boiling stock, close  pressure cooker and bring up to pressure. When pressure regulator weight  starts rocking regularly, turn heat to medium and cook 5 minutes. Reduce  pressure quickly by running cold water over lid. Stir risotto, taste and,  if necessary, cook further to desired consistency. Add 3/4 cup  Parmigiano-Reggiano. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with  remaining cheese and parsley; 6 main dish servings or       12    appetizers.
