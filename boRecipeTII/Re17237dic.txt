Its only sin was oil which has been replaced  successfully with applesauce.    Sift dry ingredients into a large bowl.  Add liquids, covering with water.  Mix thoroughly, and pour into 8 inch square pan sprayed with Pam.  Bake at  350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes. Frost with your favorite white  frosting.**    NOTE:  If you arent fussy, you can make this as a "snack cake", mixing,  baking and serving from the same pan.  No need to spray with Pam.    **My mother always used the traditional butter cream frosting on this cake.  Anyone have an outstanding white frosting recipe?
