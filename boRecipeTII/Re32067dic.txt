Precooking the chicken in the microwave or gently poaching it on the  stovetop before finishing it on the grill ensures that the meat is cooked  through but the sauce is not charred If you like a hotter sauce, increase  the amount of chili paste.    Arrange chicken pieces in a micro-proof dish, with the thickest parts  toward the outside of the dish. Cover with vented plastic wrap and  microwave at HIGH (100%) 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender, turning pieces  twice.    Alternatively, in a wide sauce-pan, cover chicken with cold water and bring  to a simmer, skimming off any froth. Simmer gently until chicken is tender,  10 to 12 minutes.    Meanwhile, prepare the grill or preheat the broiler. In a small bowl, whisk  together remaining ingredients.    With tongs, remove the chicken from the dish or sauce pan and brush both  sides generously with barbecue sauce. Grill over medium-high heat or broil,  basting with the barbecue sauce often, until the chicken is glazed on the  outside and no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes on each side.
