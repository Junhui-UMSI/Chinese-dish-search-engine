A Traditional Irish Breakfast is a hearty meal that starts the day in  Ireland. Served as an Ulster Fry in the North or an Irish Breakfast at any  restaurant or Bread & Breakfast in the South, this recipe is not for those  on a low-fat or low-cholesterol diet!    It is difficult to replicate the Traditional Irish Breakfast in the  contemporary American home. In Ireland, the sausages are so very fresh and  they are seasoned quite differently that what you may find at your local  grocers. If you decide to try this recipe, go to a proper Butcher Shop and  have a little discussion with the person behind the counter because only  the freshest ingredients will do!    Over low heat saute bacon, turning frequently until done to taste. Remove  from pan and drain on paper towels. Keep warm. It is important to note that  Irish bacon is not cooked crisp or hard.    Place sausages in the pan and cook until brown on all sides. Fry tomatoes  with the slices of pudding in the bacon drippings. Warm soda bread in the  drippings until toasted. Cook eggs as desired and place all prepared foods  on one plate to be served warm. All meats may be broiled, rather than  fried, but youll loose the flavoring from the drippings for the eggs and  soda bread.    Kitchen Staff Tip: Irish bacon is much more like back bacon in America.  What we typically serve at the breakfast table would be called streaky  bacon in Ireland and rarely used in a proper fry. You may substitute  Canadian Bacon if desired, but finding the correct back bacon, which is  much leaner than streaky bacon, is well worth the effort. Irish sausages  use less fat for flavor, so utilize any lean or even turkey-based sausages  if you want to eliminate some of the fat.
