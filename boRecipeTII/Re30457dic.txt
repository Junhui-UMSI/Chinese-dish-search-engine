Pudding: Preheat oven to 325 F. Boil the milk, add some vanilla extract and  the ginger snap crumbs. Stir for 5 or 6 minutes or longer with the heat  turned down to medium. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes or so. Add  the beaten eggs to this while whisking the mixture energetically. Add the  dates, brown sugar, and the walnuts (if you want them). Add 1/2 a tsp of  ginger powder, and finally, the foodprocessed bananas. WHisk well.    Butter an 8 or 9 inch pan. Sprinkle its bottom and sides with white sugar  so that they are coated completely with a thin layer of sugar. Gently shake  out any excess. Pour the pudding mixture into pan, and bake for 50 minutes  to an hour.    While it is baking, prepare the mango sauce.  Boil together the mangoes,  sugar, ginger, and 2 cups water (or the undrained peaches, sugar, ginger  and 1 cup water), cooking it over medium heat for about 10 minutes or so.  Pour this through a strainer, forcing the fruit pulp through with the back  of a wooden spoon. Mix well.    Cool the pudding in pan for about 5 minutes. Turn it out onto a cake plate  or any serving plate, and smother it with the sauce on top.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
