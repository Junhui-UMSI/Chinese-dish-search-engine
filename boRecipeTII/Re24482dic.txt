Tropical Trifle
Day old pound cake or 24, (12 oz) evaporated milk, Sweet sherry or dessert wine, Kiwifruit  peeled & sliced, Vanilla, Whole Milk, Ladyfinger or 36 macaroons, Halved seedless red grapes, Lightly beaten egg yolks, Plus 2 Tbls. sugar, Sliced strawberries, (plus extra), Mangos  peeled & sliced, 
Heat milks in saucepan over low heat. Add 1 cup sugar & yolks,  whisking slowly so eggs dont lump. Continue to cook, stirring  constantly, until mixture becomes very thick. Do not allow to boil or  it will curdle. Add 2 Tbls. sherry & vanilla. Remove from heat &  cool. Combine berries with 2 Tbls. sugar; set aside.  Line a trifle  dish (or any clear, deep dish) with cake slices. Pour half of the  cooled custard over the cake, then add half of the fruit, including  berries. Add another layer of cake & top with remaining custard, then  fruit. Refrigerate until serving time. If desired, sprinkle more  sherry over trifle before serving.
