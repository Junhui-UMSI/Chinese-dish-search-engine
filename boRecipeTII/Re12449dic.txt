Zuppa Di Asparagi (Calabrian Asparagus Soup)
Pepper, black, Eggs, Italian bread, Vegetable broth, Salt, Parmesan, Garlic, Asparagus, Olive oil, extra-virgin, 
In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate heat,  stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the asparagus and  cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper and  Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to moderately low and  simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15 minutes.    In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the heat  to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle about  2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly. Once  incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the saucepan.  Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking constantly,  until it just thickens, about 8 minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or  the eggs will curdle. Remove from the heat.    Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot soup on  top and serve with additional grated cheese.    Note:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in  which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or  slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.                                    -- We Called It Macaroni                                     by Nancy Verde Barr                                     Alfred A. Knopf
