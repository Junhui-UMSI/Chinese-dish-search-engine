Barbecued Potatoes
Vinaigrette dressing, Salt and pepper to taste, potatoes, 
SERVES 6-8      I owe this dish to a friend, Brian. He will put anything in his barbecue  except the neighbors dog. He can eat three meals a day out of his cooker,  so I was anxious to respond to his dinner invitation. This recipe was  particularly unusual and delicious. It is just too simple to believe.      Bake the potatoes in their skins about 30 minutes at 450?, or until they  are just slightly tender. Do not fully cook them as they must be sliced.  While still a bit hot, cut the potatoes lengthwise in half and then each  half into quarters. Place the pieces in a glass baking dish and cover with  the dressing. Let stand 1 hour, turning once. Remove from the dressing and  place on the grill. Salt and pepper to taste and grill the pieces until  golden brown, about       10    minutes on each side.
