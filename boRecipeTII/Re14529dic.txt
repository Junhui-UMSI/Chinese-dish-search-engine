"Day At the Beach" Chicken
Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette, Black pepper, Cinnamon, Split chicken Breasts, Seasoned salt, 
(from the Kitchen of Doom)    Mix the dressing and the Dales, and let the mix chill in the fridge while  you skin the chicken breasts. (My bow to the Fat Police-) Rub the chicken  with seasoned salt, pepper, and the Roasting mix to taste. When thats  done, put the chicken and the dressing mix in a bowl, and marinade for at  least an hour.    Turn the oven on at 350. Arrange the chicken breasts, meat side up, in a  pan, and pour the marinade over them. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon. Let  them cook until nearly done, basting often. Increase the oven temp to 400  for the last few minutes of cooking time.    The chicken should have a nice, dark red color when it comes out of the  oven. And it smells wonderful while its cooking. Be sure you baste it  fairly often, though. I have a feeling that it would try to dry out if you  gave it the chance.    I served my red chicken with nibblets, pineapples, and baked potatoes. If  you dont have Dales Sauce around (its a regional thing, I think-) you  can sub dark soy sauce with a little worchestershire in it and get basicly  the same taste and effect. The Spice Hunters rub is a spicy mix of things  like curry and cumin. Use it sparingly.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by JoAnne F Spencer <brightfires@JUNO.COM> on Dec  17, 1997
