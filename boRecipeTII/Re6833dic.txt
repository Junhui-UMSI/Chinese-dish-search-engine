Slice turkey breast and open it like a book. Flatten with blade of  large knife or with meat mallet until it forms a large sheet.  Sprinkle with garlic, parsley and salt and pepper on both sides. Set  aside.    Place ground meat, bread crumbs, eggs, 2 tablespoons chicken broth and  pistachios in a bowl. Add a half teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper  and mix.    Spread mixture over open turkey breast, then roll up the short way,  as you would for a jelly roll. Tie with string.    Place sage, rosemary and olive oil in a skillet. Brown turkey roll on  all sides. Add the wine and raise the heat to let alcohol evaporate.  Add a half cup of broth and simmer, tightly covered, for about two  hours, turning only once. Add more broth if necessary.    Remove string before slicing. Serve with grapan juices strained over  the slices.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
