Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add 3  cups flour, applesauce, and next 6 ingredients; beat at low speed of an  electric mixer until moistened. Beat at meduim speed for an additional 2  minutes. Stir in 2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.  Turn out onto a well-floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic(about  5 minutes); add enough remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent  dough from sticking to hands. Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking  spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from  drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and turn out  onto a lightly floured surface. Roll dough to 1/2 inch thickness; cut with  a lightly floured 2 1/2 inch doughnut cutter. Combine doughnut holes and  any remaining scraps of dough; reroll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut as  before. Place doughnuts on baking sheets coated with cooking spray; brush 2  tablespoons melted margarine over doughnuts. Let rise, uncovered, in a  warm, draft-free place for 40 minutes. Combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon  in a large zip-top heavy-duty plastic bag, and set aside. Bake doughnuts at  425 degrees for 8 minutes or until golden. Immediately brush remaining 2  tablespoons melted margarine over baked doughnuts; add doughnuts to plastic  bag. Seal the bag and shake to coat.
