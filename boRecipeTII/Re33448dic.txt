Dip 1 or  2 slices of bread in the milk mixture. Gently squeeze as much liquid as  possible from the bread without tearing it.  Place the bread in a 12 inch  round or oval au grain dish and cover with a slice of prosciutto, several  arugula leaves dipped in olive oil, some slices of basil torta, and a few  tomato slices.  Drizzle sparingly with pesto.  Repeat the layering,  overlapping the bread slices slightly, until the dish is filled.  Beat the  eggs with salt and pepper to taste and pour evenly over the layers in the  dish.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.    The following day remove the dish from the refrigerator and let warm to  room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Drizzle the top with the  cream and bake until puffy and browned, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve  immediately.  6 portions.    Basic Pesto: Process the basil, garlic, and walnuts (or pine nuts) in a  food processor fitted with a steel blade or in 2 batches in a blender,  until finely chopped. With the machine running, pour in the oil in a thin,  steady stream. Add the cheeses, a big pinch of salt, and a liberal grinding  of pepper. Process briefly to combine. Remove to a bowl and cover until  ready to use. Yield 2 cups.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /EGGS    REFRIGERATE OVERNIGHT    From rec.food.cooking archives.
