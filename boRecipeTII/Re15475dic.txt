White Chocolate Cheesecake
Chocolate Cookie Crumbs, Butter -- melted, Cream Cheese -- softened, Vanilla, Crust-----, Eggs, Filling-----, White Chocolate -- melted, Sugar, 
heat oven to 350F.    Mix crumbs and butter and press onto bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.  Bake for 10 minutes.    Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla at medium until well blended. Add  eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in the white  chocolate. Pour over crust.    Bake for 35 minutes and turn oven off and let cool in oven for at least an  hour.  Loosen cake from rim of pan and continue cooling. Refrigerate for at  least 2 hours (best if over night). I like to garnish this with dollops of  whipped cream and a sprinkling of crushed chcoclate cookies.    Recipe By     : Janet Morrissey <janetm@MAGNUS1.  COM>
