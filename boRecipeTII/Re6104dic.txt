Stir in an additional 1/3 cup  lukewarm water, oil, 2 cups flour, and salt and blend mixt    ure until it forms a dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface,  incorporating as much of the remaining 1/4 cup flour as necessary to  prevent the dough from sticking, for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is smooth  a    nd elastic.    Alternatively, the dough may be made in a food processor. Proof the yeast  as described above and in a food processor combine it with the remaining  ingredients. Process the mixture until it forms a ba    ll, adding more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if it is too dry, or more  flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if it is too wet, and knead the dough by  processing it for 15 seconds.  Put the dough, prepared by either method, in an oiled bowl and turn it to  coat it with the oil. Let the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a  warm place for 1 hour, or until it is double in bulk, and punch it down.  The dough is now ready to be formed into pizzas.
