Maryellen: Here are some recipes from Native Peoples Magazine, using  mesquite meal. I got these from their web site:  http://www.nativepeoples.com/    Preheat oven to 350F. In a mixing bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs,  mesquite meal, butter, 1 tablespoon honey, and cinnamon. Using fingers,  press mixture evenly on bottom and half way up sides of 9-inch spring-form  pan. Set aside.    In large mixing bowl, with mixer at high speed, beat cream cheese,  remaining honey, and vanilla until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time,  mixing well. Stir in sour cream. Pour batter into crust; bake 50 to 60  minutes, until center sets. Turn off oven, leaving door slightly ajar.  Leave cake in oven 1 hour; remove and allow to cool. Chill at least 2  hours; then prepare glaze and peel and slice peaches. Arrange peaches on  top of cake and spoon over glaze. Return to refrigerator until ready to  serve. Makes 8 to 10 servings.    Prickly Pear Glaze: Combine 1/4 cup apple juice and cornstarch. In  saucepan, combine remaining apple juice, prickly pear juice, and honey.  Stir over medium heat until honey melts. Add cornstarch mixture and stir  until mixture boils, thickens, and turns clear. Cook one minute and set  aside to cool slightly.
