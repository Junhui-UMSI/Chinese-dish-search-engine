Toasted Brown Rice with Tomatoes
Water, Tamari, Brown rice, frying pan, non-stick, 
Heres one Im going to place on my cooking page  (http://www.startext.net/homes/bevku/show) later today. Thought Id share  it with yall first.    What to do with what youve got?    Have the diced tomoatoes done first, add the tamari or soy and toss very  lightly.    Crank the heat up to high.    Add all of the rice at once into the pan and start stirring almost  immediately. Continue to stir the rice until it is lighty toasted and you  can smell the wonderfulness of the grain.    CAREFULLY add two cups of cold water, stir, then add the tomatoes.    Bring to a boil and turn heat down to simmer.    Cover tightly for 45 minutes. It will fill the house with such an aroma  that your salavary glands will be working overtime.    NOW what to do with this wonderful stuff youve just turned out?    Serve as a side dish to whatever your main dish is or use as a bed for a a  quick stir fry (using no fat at all, of couse) of green, yellow, red  (whatever is inexpensive in your part of the country at the moment) some  onions, spinach...make it YOUR own stir fry.    Serve with a little tamari on the side.    Tip: Dont EVER take the lid off of cooking rice. It takes 45 minutes for  brown rice (as a rule) and 20 minutes for white rice. Lifting the cover  just maeks things yikey and sticky and bleech.    Keeping the cover on yields a fluffy rice virtually everytime.
