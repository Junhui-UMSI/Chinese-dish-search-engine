(From "Soup and Bread: A Country Inn Cookbook" by Crescent  Dragonwagon. Workman Publishing; $12.95)    In a 10" skillet, melt the butter or heat the oil over medium-low  heat. Add the onion and saute slowly until almost limp but not brown,  about 6-7 minutes. Add the tamari or soy sauce and the tomato. Cook,  stirring often, until the tomatos juice has evaporated, about 6  minutes.    Transfer the saute to a soup pot. Deglaze the saute pan with a little  of the stock, and add the pan contents, plus the remainder of the  stock to the soup pot. Add the pumpkin or squash puree, the maple  syrup or honey, salt and a touch of freshly ground black pepper.  Heat, stirring often.    Separately, in a small pot with a tightly fitting lid, steam the  broccoli flowerets and stems until tender-crisp (they should be a  bright green), about 3-4 minutes.    Stir the steamed broccoli into the soup, then stir in the cream. Let  the soup cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot and the  flavors have blended, 8-10 minutes.
