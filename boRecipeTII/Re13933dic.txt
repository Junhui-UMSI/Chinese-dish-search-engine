Wine Marguerita
Can Lemonade Concentrate --, Lime Mix Powder -- Tang or, Fresh Limes, Triple Sec, Water -- (or soda water), Bar mix, Dry white wine, 
Combine water, limeade concentrate, lime powder and juice squeezed from  limes.  Stir briskly until dissolved. Add wine and Triple Sec, cover and  refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.  To create a frothy  marguerita combine the whites from 2 eggs with 6 servings of the marguerita  and whip in a blender for 2 or 3 minutes. [yes, the recipe does say to put  in the egg whites.  Is this safe?  What else could be substituted to make a  froth ?  Just buzz in the blender with ice chips?]    Makes 20 servings.
