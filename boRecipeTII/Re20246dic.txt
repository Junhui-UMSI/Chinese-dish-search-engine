Lightly beat the eggs in a deep dish,using a fork or whisk.. Dip each chop  in the egg,coating both sides and letting the excess flow back into the  plate as you pull the chop away.. Turn the meat in the bread crumbs as  follows:Press the chop firmly against the crumbs,using the palm of your  hand.Tap the chop 2 or 3 times,then turn it and repeat the proceedure..  Your palm should come away dry,whish means the crumbs are adhering to the  meat... Choose a saucepan tha can subsequently accomodate the chops without  overlapping.If you dont have a large enough pan,you can usea smaller  one,and do the chops in to or even three batches.Put in the butter and  oil,turn on the heat to medium high,and when the butter foam begins to  subside,slip in the chops.. Cook until a dark golden crust forms on one  side,then turn them and do the other side,altogether about 5  minutes,depending on the thickness of the chops and desired degree of  doneness.Transfer to a warm platter and sprinkle with salt.Makes 6  servings....
