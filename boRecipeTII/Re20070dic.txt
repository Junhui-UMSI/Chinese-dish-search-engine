Source: Family Recipe /by Traudle Lessing.    Note : During the years, I make the same crescents instead of Almonds, I  take : 1/2 cup Ground Walnuts + 1/2 cup Haselnuts (Filbert) which I put  them in the toaster oven for 10 -15 minutes or untill nice brown, Between  my hands I rube them to remove the brown flaky skin,then I ground them.My  family says that they are much better then the origenal.    Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add 1/2 a cup flourone at a  time to butter .Then add the nuts , Vanilla essence and salt. Continue to  beat untill dough become slightly stif, You may add more flour. Shap dough  into a ball ,wrap in nylon seal and refrigerate for an hour.    Pinch off walnuts - size pieces of the chilled dough, place them on floured  board: Roll each one into a strip, an inch wide /1/2 inch thick. Shape to  crescet.    Arrange on baking sheets covered with baking paper at least 1/2 inch apart.    Bake in pre heate 350F hot oven for 15 - 20 minutes, or lightly brown, Cool  about 5 minutes and dust with icing sugar .    Keep ,in air tight container.    Note: I make my own icing suger by grounding in coffee grounder to fine  sugar dust.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #299 by Annice Grinberg  <VSANNICE@WEIZMANN.WEIZMANN.AC.IL> on Nov 16, 97
