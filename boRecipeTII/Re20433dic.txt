If making rolls, set on dough cycle. When done, fashion into the shapes you  want. Heat oven for 2 minutes, thenTURN IT OFF. Cover rolls with a moist  kitchen towel. Place in oven for 20 minutes, or until doubled. Remove rolls  from oven. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake 20 minutes or until done.    Bread slicing tip: Let your bread cool for at least one hour or better  overnight before cutting. I use a bread slicing rack with several slits and  a special knife for slicing bread that costs about $4 -- money well spent!    I devised this recipe from several others and have made it for a few years.

I make my bread on basic and  light color settings.    tsp. = teaspoon Tbsp. = tablespoon    Add ingredients in the order required by your bread machine:    >From Sherry Rose <sherry@gorge.net>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
