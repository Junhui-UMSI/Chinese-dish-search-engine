Banana Bread
walnuts, Bananas, Eggs, Baking soda, Salt, Shortening, Sugar, Flour, Baking Powder, 
Mix all ingredients together. Let mixture rest for 10 minutes in loaf pan  before baking.    For a large loaf pan bake 350 for 70 minutes.    2 small loaf pans 350 for 45 minutes.    My husband loves banana bread, and this is the only one he will eat. It has  been passed down from his mothers side of the family for generations. I  truly believe it is the setup period before baking that makes this bread a  winner.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #396 by Laura Harpole  <harpoe@pioneer-net.com> on Nov 18, 1997
