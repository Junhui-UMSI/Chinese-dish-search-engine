Truffle Cups
Semisweet chocolate --, Finely chopped, Chips, Or semisweet chocolate, 
1. Melt 6 ounces finely chopped semisweet chocolate or 1 package (6 oz)  semisweet chocolate chips in a double boiler or a bowl set over a pan of  hot water. Stir until smooth.    2. Working quickly, use the back of a spoon or a small knife to spread  chocolate on bottom and up sides of 6 to 8 paper cupcake liners. Set liners  in a muffin pan. Chill until firm in freezer, 10 to 15 minutes, or in  refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes. Carefully peel off the paper liners,  handling chocolate as little as possible.    * Timesaver Tip: Recipe can be prepared up to 5 days ahead. Store Truffle  Cups in the refrigerator, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent  moisture condensation. After a number of days, the Truffle Cups may develop  a grayish tinge, caused by cocoa butter rising to the surface. The  chocolate may be less attractive, but it will be no less flavorful or safe  to eat.    Microwave Version: Chocolate may be melted in the microwave oven. Place  chocolate in a small glass bowl. Microwave on 50% power until softened (2  to 2-1/2 minutes). Stir until smooth. Do not overheat or chocolate will  scorch around edges and wont blend smoothly. Continue with step 2.  Preparation time and timesaver tip same as above.
