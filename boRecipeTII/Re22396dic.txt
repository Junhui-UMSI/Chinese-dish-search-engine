Turnip Slaw
White turnip, Pepper, Prepared mustard, Celery seed, fresh dill, Sour cream, Tarragon Vinegar, salt, Sugar, Mayonnaise, 
In a large bowl, stir together the mayonaisse, sour cream, tarragon  vinegar, mustard, sugar, salt, celery seed, pepper, dill, and turnip. Mix  well and refrigerate until needed.    NOTE:  The turnip is a neglected root, a vegetable that is never discussed,  and rarely seen in public.  Here it gets its proper due in a recipe that  sets off the little bite in its flavor and the little crunch of its  texture.  Use it wherever you would coleslaw.
