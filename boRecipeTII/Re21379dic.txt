* Use a 16-ounce can of peaches, in syrup or in its own juice for a less  sweet sauce.    Put all the ingredients in a blender and run on high speed until smooth.  Spoon sauce over meat, basting every 15 minutes with the drippings in pan.  If used for outdoor grilling, baste after meat is about half cooked.  Continue basting until meat is done.
