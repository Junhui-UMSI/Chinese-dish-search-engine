** See recipe for Chicken Stock.         Heat the butter in a saucepan, and add the sorrel.  Stir over  medium heat until wilted (2 to 3 minutes.) Add basil, chives, and  tarragon and stir for 2 minutes.  Add the stock, and bring to a boil -  boil for 5 minutes.         Season to taste with salt and white pepper.         In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cream.  Very  gradually whisk the hot mixture into the cream mixture.  Return the  combined mixture back to the saucepan and stir constantly over low heat  until lightly thickened (about 4 minutes.)  DO NOT BOIL.         Transfer the soup to a bowl set in a larger bowl of ice water and  stir until cool.  Refrigerate.         Add fresh lemon juice to taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt  and white pepper.  Garnish with creme fraiche or sour cream.
