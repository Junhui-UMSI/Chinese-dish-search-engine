Whole Wheat Olive Bread
Honey, olive oil, Fresh thyme, Black olives, Salt, Active dry yeast, water, Whole wheat flour, Onion, Bread flour, 
In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil, add the onions, and cook until  soft, 4 or 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.  Dissolve the yeast in the water with the honey. In a medium mixing bowl,  combine the yeast mixture, onion mixture, salt, olives, and thyme and stir  well. Add the whole wheat flour and stir to combine well. Add enough of the  bread flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto a  floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding flour as  necessary. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or in a plastic  bag, and set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.  Punch down and divide the dough in half. Shape into 2 round loaves, flatten  them slightly, and place them on an oiled baking sheet. Set aside to rise  again until doubled.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake 35 to 45 minutes, or until well  browned and the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on  racks.
