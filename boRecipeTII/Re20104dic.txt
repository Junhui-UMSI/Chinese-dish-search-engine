Pour it in the ice-maker or any other bowl. When  using an ice-maker it will be ready in 20 minutes. When you have not put it  in the freezer and mix it every 5 minutes first, and after a while every 10  minutes.    This is the basic-recipe I use, e.g. to make `walnut-cream add about 150  gr. crushed walnuts or any other nuts. (very good with a warm-orange  sauce).
