PREHEAT OVER TO 400F. Combine the first 5 ingredients in a bowl and set  aside. Cut 5-or-6 long slits in the eggplant (fewer if youre using  Japanese eggplants) and place a slice of garlic into each slit. Wrap the  eggplant, together with the bay leaf and thyme branches, tightly in foil  and bake until completely soft all over--45 minutes-to-1 1/2 hours,  depending on the size of the eggplant. If youre using the large eggplant,  turn it over after 45 minutes and continue baking until soft to the touch  and tender at the stem end. When done, remove eggplant from the oven, open  the package and let sit for 5 minutes or so. Discard any liquid. When the  eggplant is cool enough to handle, scrape the flesh away from the skin, put  it into a food processor and add the yogurt mixture and the olive oil.  Process until smooth, but leave a little texture. Stir in the lemon juice  or vinegar to taste and season with salt. Turn the puree into a serving  bowl and season with pepper and fresh herbs, such as thyme leaves and  blossoms, marjoram or oregano. If those herbs arent available, use some  chopped parsley or scallions. Serve the spread at room temperature with  crackers, pita bread or bread toasted and brushed with olive oil.
