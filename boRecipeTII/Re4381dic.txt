Persistent Gert
Active dry yeast, Warm water (90 Degrees F.), Honey, Whole wheat flour, All purpose flour, 
(by Richard Blunt, in Backwoods Home magazine)    1. Combine all ingredients in a large glass, ceramic, or stainless steel  bowl. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and set it aside in a warm  spot for 3 to 5 days. Were using plastic wrap here, instead of  cheesecloth, because were ensuring that no wild yeasts get into the  starter. Each day stir the mixture down. When its bubbly and smells sour,  its ready to use.    (Richard continues: "This starter is boosted by prepared dry yeast. Its  both dependable and easy to work with. You can hear it fermenting clear  across the kitchen during the first two days of chemical change. Then it  falls silent. This is enough to make you think that there is no life left  in it. But take my word for it, this starter and the person it is named for  have life and energy that will be with us for a long time).    Maria: this works in bread machines quite well...and in my wood stove.  Persistent Gert has been one of the happier Sourdough starters in my  kitchen and has failed me only once -- when the kitchen was so cold, the  thermometer read minus 20.
