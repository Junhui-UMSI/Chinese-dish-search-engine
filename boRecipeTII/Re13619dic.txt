Place stock in saucepan and reduce by half. Add heavy cream and simmer  until reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Wisk the milk eggs and 3/4 tsp salt together.  Wisk in the reduced sauce/cream mixture. Melt butter over medium heat and  add the shallots and garlic. Cook until wilted. Add the mushrooms and thyme  and cook about 10 min until the mushrooms are wilted. Add 1/2 tsp salt and  pepper to taste. Line the bottom of a 2 quart casserole or souffle dish  with  a layer of bread slices. Top with 1/2 of the mushrooms. Repeat the  layers and end with a top third bread layer. Pour over the egg milk stock  mixture. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Preheat the oven to 350F. Unwrap  the dish and press the bread down into the liquid if necessary. Cover the  pan with foil and place in a roasting pan. Pour boiling water in the  raosting pan to come halfway up the side of the dish. Bake until the  pudding has set and the top is uffed and brown-about two hours. Uncover the  last 15-30 minutes to brown top if necessary. The pudding can be made ahead  and rewarmed. Serve warm. Serves 6-8.
