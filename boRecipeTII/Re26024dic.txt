Freshly ground pepper & salt    Tofu supplies the protein, and tastes similar to chicken breasts, in  this quick-to-prepare colorful vegetarian main dish.    Drain tofu, cut into 3/4 inch pieces.  Place between layers of paper  towel and weight down with a dinner plate.  Let stand 10 minutes to  compress and remove excess water.    Heat oil, 2 tbsp broth and ginger in a frypan.   Add celery, onion  and red pepper.  Stir cook over medium heat 3 minutes.  Add bean  sprouts, continue stir-cooking 1 min.    Stir in remaining broth, soy sauce and tofu.  Cook and stir gently  over medium heat until vegetables are tender-crisp, and liquid is  evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    1 3/4 cup serving - 194 calories 13 grams carbohydrate, 13 grams  protein, 10 grams fat 2 protein choices, 1 fruit & veg. choice, 1  fats & oils choice    Source:  Choice Cooking, Canadian Diabetes Assoc. 1986 Shared but not  tested by Elizabeth Rodier Nov 93    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/diabetic.zip
