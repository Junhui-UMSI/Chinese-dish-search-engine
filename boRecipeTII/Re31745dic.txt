Sybil Carters Peanut Butter Fudge
Peanut butter, milk, Cider vinegar, Corn syrup, Sugar, 
Mix together sugar, milk, syrup, and vinegar. Cook to soft ball stage (a  little syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when  removed from water). Remove from heat and cool to lukewarm. Add peanut  butter and beat until creamy. Dump into 10" buttered pan, put out in pan,  and cut into squares.
