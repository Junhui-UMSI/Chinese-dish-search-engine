Pie Crust #4
Water, Vinegar, All-purpose flour, Shortening, Egg, Salt, 
Mix egg, water & vinegar in cup. Beat slightly. Mix flour, salt &  shortening together. Add egg mixture & mix well. Form into ball & divide  into 3 equal parts. Roll out on floured surface. This makes enough for  three 9-inch pie shells. (Will keep in refrigerator for a week.)    MRS. W.E. PARSONS    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.
