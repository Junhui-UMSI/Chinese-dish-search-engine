This is one of my favorite recipes from Authentic Mexican by Rick and Deann  Bayless. Although it is not a vegetarian cookbook there are lots of recipes  that can be adapted.    1. Put the zucchini in a colander and sprinkle with salt and toss. Let  stand in the sink or over a plate for 30 minutes. Rinse and then dry with  paper towels.    2. Heat the broth and saute the garlic until lightly browned. Do Not Burn!  Scoop out the garlic and set aside.    3. Add squash and saute, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until  tender, but still srunchy. Remove from heat.    4. Stir in the garlic and lime; toss thoroughly. Sprinkle with the pepper,  oregano, and parsley. Mix. Taste for salt and serve warm.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #208 by JBennicoff@aol.com on Sep 13, 1997
