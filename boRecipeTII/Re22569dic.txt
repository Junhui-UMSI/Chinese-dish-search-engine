Apricot and Poppy Seed Muffins
Sugar, Apricot baby food, Baking soda, Salt, All-purpose flour, Vanilla, Poppy seeds, Stick butter or margarine,, Finely chopped nuts, Eggs, 
Line 12 muffin tins with a paper or foil liner or grease the pans well with  butter or vegetable shortening. Spoon the baby food into a small bowl and  stir in the baking soda. The mixture will foam up. In a large bowl, cream  the butter and sugar until the mixture is smooth, then add the eggs and mix  well. Add the flour, salt, vanilla, the apricot mixture and the poppy seeds  or nuts, and mix just until all the dry ingredients are moistened. Do not  overmix.    Divide the batter among the 12 cups, filling each cup 2/3 full, and bake in  a preheated 350 F oven about 20 to 25 minutes, or until a cake tester or  toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean. Cool the  muffins on a wire rack. These muffins will keep, if well wrapped, at room  temperature for three days and refrigerated for up to a week. To freeze,  cool completely and then store in an airtight freezer bag. Defrost,  covered, at room temperature.
