Date:    Fri, 14 Jun 1996 10:27:00 +0100    From:    Anja Wolle <A.C.Wolle@SOTON.AC.UK>  here is something else I threw together last night (open the fridge, see  whats left and use it all up...), while it came out very tasty I think it  will probably need a bit of refinement - I would appreciate comments from  those of you experienced with making meatloaf....  This is that I did:    With my food food processor attachment I finely minced the turkey,  mushrooms, onion and garlic.  Mixed those well with egg; salt and pepper to  taste.  Places it in an 1 lb loaf pan and baked at 400oF for about 35 mins  until done.    While it was very tasty (and had a lovely strong mushroom flavour) I think  the non-mushroomephiles might prefer it with the mushroom quantity halved  or the meat doubled. Also it could do with more cohesion (?), it was  rather crumbly - I would have added a slice of bread, also minced, but we  had run out of bread. Do you thing that would have made any difference?    I served it with tomato sauce made from pureed plum tomates, which  complemented it really well.    EAT-L DIGEST 13 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
