Vickis Sweet Potato Souffle
Butter, Light brown sugar, Eggs, Raisins, Cinnamon, Sugar, Lemon extract, marshmallows, sweet potatoes, Coconut, grated, Salt, Vanilla extract, 
Cook, peel and mash the sweet potatoes.  Add butter and eggs to the  potatoes and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.  Add all remaining  ingredients, saving a little of the coconut.  Place in a buttered, 2 quart  casserole dish and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Bake at 350 degrees for about  30 minuts.  A few minutes before removing this dish from the oven, sprinkle  with the remaining coconut and a layer of mini marshmallows and complete  browning for about 5 more minutes.    This stuff is habit forming!  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #333    From: kountry@nmol.com    Date: Wed, 4 Dec 1996 23:44:26 -0500
