Prsurate (Holiday Season Drop Doughnuts)
Brandy, Lemon (grated peel), Flour, Sugar, for frying, Nutmeg; grated, Dried yeast, Tepid water, Soy or other light oil, Vanilla, Raisins, Hot water (about), 
Place flour in large bowl (or on table) and into hole in middle, add  gradually about a quart of hot water as you blend. Beating as you go, and  sides are cleaned of batter, whip the batter thoroughly with the wooden  spoon and add water until the mixture begins to ball. Continue whipping, as  you gradually add the sugar, brandy, vanilla, nutmeg, raisins and lemon  zest (grated peel).    Lastly, blend in and whip 1/2 cup tepid water in which you let soak 6  teaspoons of dried yeast as you begin the recipe. Let batter stand (about  15-20 minutes) while oil heats. Heat about 1 1/2 quarts soy oil, or other  light cooking oil, in pan at ideal depth of 2 1/2 inches. Whip the dough  again.  Have teaspoon and cup warm water handy.    When oil is hot enough (stops squeaking), take a small fistful of dough and  squeeze upward a ball about double, filling the teaspoon that had been  dipped in the warm water, then drop in hot oil. Continue, dipping spoon in  water before scraping off the ball of dough, until your pan surface is  nicely filled but not crowded. Take this opportunity to whip some more air  into your dough.  Youll find from time to time they have to be coaxed to  stay turned.  When both sides are golden brown, remove and let cool  slightly before rolling in confectioners (fine) sugar to coat. Theyre  best on cold nights between sips of your favorite whiskey ("rakija").
