Divide batter evenly  between 2 8x4 inch loaf pans coated with non-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle  each with 1 tablespoon sugar.    Bake at 350F for one hour and ten minutes or until a wooden pick inserted  in center comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes in pans on a wire rack; remove  from pans and cool completely on rack.
