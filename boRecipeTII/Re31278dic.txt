Its a good crowd pleaser if you make it at the table with an alcohol  burner.    Melt butter over alcohol burner or in attractive skillet. Stir in sugar,  cinnamon, and banana liquor, and heat a few minutes. Add bananas and saute  until slightly browned.  Add rum, heat well, then tip pan to ignite. ("This  is unnecessary without an audience, unless you like fire." The alcohol will  boil off after about 2 minutes.) Sift bananas carefully out of pan, place  four pieces over each scoop if ice cream. Spoon sauce over top. Serves 4.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.
