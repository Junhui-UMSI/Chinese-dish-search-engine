You may love your peaches and cream chilled, but the way to serve this  lovely light bread is warm from the oven. Like your favorite peach cobbler,  the subtle richness of the flavors lends itself perfectly to a light  topping of fresh butter. Try it for bread and butter sandwiches and you may  decide to make afternoon tea a ritual.    For a creamy texture, use low fat yogurt; if youre calorie counting,  nonfat will do.    For more of a cobbler effect, increase nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.    This bread tends to have a dark crust. Try the "light" crust setting.    This recipe can be used with the regular and quick bake cycles.    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 423 by "rudolph"  <rudolph@1st.net> on Dec 30, 1997
