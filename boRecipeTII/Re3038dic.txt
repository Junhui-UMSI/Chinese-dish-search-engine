Peanut Buttery Stir-Fry
Peanut butter, Soy sauce, Lemon juice, Vegetable oil, Carrot, Garlic, A few leaves Chinese cabbage, Tofu, Onion, Mung beansprouts, Water, Brown rice, Soymilk, Green beans, Piece ginger root (1/4-inch), 
Cook the rice until tender.    Dice the tofu.  Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a wok or frying pan (skillet) and  stir-fry the tofu until lightly browned. Remove from wok.    Slice the onion thinly.  Slice the carrot into matchsticks. Chop the beans  finely.  Heat 2 teaspoons oil in the wok and stir-fry these ingredients 2-3  minutes.    Chop the cabbage leaves and add them to the wok along with the beansprouts.  Continue stir-frying until just tender.    Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely.  Heat the remaining teaspoon  oil in a small saucepan and add the garlic and ginger. Cook for a minute or  two, then stir in the peanut butter and then the water. Stir until smooth.  (This much can be done before the vegetables start cooking; the rest should  wait until they are nearly ready.) Add the lemon juice, soy sauce and milk,  and stir well.    Return the tofu to the wok, and stir in the peanut butter sauce. Mix well  and serve on top of the rice.    * Source: The Single Vegan - by Leah Leneman * Typed for you by Karen  Mintzias
