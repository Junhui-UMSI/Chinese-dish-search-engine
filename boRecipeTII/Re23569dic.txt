Arroz Criollo (Early Spanish Rice)
Onions, Salt, Basil leaves, B, A, Green Pepper, Tomato, Pepper, Regular rice, garlic, oil, Water, 
In skillet cook "A". Cook until vegetables are tender. Then stir in "B".  Cook covered, over low heat until rice is done, about 20 minutes. serves  6-8.    NOTE- the recipe says 6 - 8 but i think that is as a side dish serving. i  could personally eat this entire thing if i was given an hour break in  between the two servings.    * i love tomatoes and so i use more than the specified 1 cup. i usually use  about 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cup of tomatoes    Posted to recipelu-digest by Kara9718 <Kara9718@aol.com> on Mar 14, 1998
