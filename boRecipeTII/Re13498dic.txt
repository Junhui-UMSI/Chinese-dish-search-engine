Whole-Wheat Crepes
Whole wheat flour, Egg, All-purpose flour, Margarine, Skim milk, Vegetable cooking spray, 
Place both flours in a medium bowl. Combine, milk, margarine, and egg, and  add mixture to flour, stirring with a wire whisk until almost smooth. Cover  batter, and chill for 1 hour.    Coat an 8-inch crepe pan or non stick skillet with vegetable cooking spray,  and place over medium-high heat until hot. Remove pan from heat, and pour a  scant 1/4 cup batter into pan; quickly tilt pan in all directions so batter  covers pan with a thin film. Cook about 1 minute.    Carefully lift edge of crepe with spatula to test for doneness. The crepe  is ready to turn when it can be shaken loose from pan and the underside is  lightly browned. Turn crepe over, and cook 30 seconds on other side.    Place the crepe on a towel, and allow it to cool. Repeat procedure untill  all of the batter is used. Yield: 12 servings.
