1. Combine the flours, sugar, and baking powder, and stir to mix well. Use  a pastry cutter to cut in the margarine or butter until the mixture  resembles coarse meal. Stir in the egg whites and the vanilla and almond  extracts. Fold in the almonds.    2.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and shape into two 9 x 2  inch logs. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, and place the  logs on the sheet, leaving 4 inches of space between the logs to allow for  spreading. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, or until lightly  browned.    3. Cool the logs at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then use a serrated  knife to slice the logs diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices.    4. Place the slices on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer, cut  side down. Bake at 350 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes, or until dry and  crisp, turning the slices after 10 minutes.    5. Transfer the biscotti to wire racks, and cool completely. Serve  immediately or store in an airtight container.
