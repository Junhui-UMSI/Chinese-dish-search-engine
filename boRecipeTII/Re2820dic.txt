Peanut Butter Crinkles
Salt, Butter, Egg, Baking soda, Vanilla, Peanut butter, Flour, Granulated sugar, Brown sugar, 
Small chocolate candies (such as Hersheys Kisses or Miniatures)    Preheat oven to 350F.    Cream butter and peanut butter until smooth. Add sugars and mix well. Stir  in egg and vanilla. Sift in dry ingredients. Gradually beat into butter  mixture. Roll into 1" diameter balls. Roll in granulated sugar and place on  ungreased cookie sheet about 2" apart. (No need to press them down, they  will spread on their own). Bake for about 10 minutes or until golden.    Immediately after removing cookies from oven, press a chocolate firmly into  the center of the cookie if desired. (These are best eaten while still warm  and just after the chocolate melts).    NOTES:    I used Extra Chunky peanut butter. Instead of light brown sugar, I used  dark (personal preference). I also added in a couple of TB. of unsweetened  cocoa.
