Tartelettes Au Bleu (Blue Cheese Tartlets)
Pine nuts, nutmeg, Roquefort cheese, Tart pastry dough, Spinach, fresh, Emmenthaler, Salt and freshly gound black pepper, Heavy cream, Egg, 
Prepare the dough and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. If using commercial  puff pastry, defrost in fridge or at room temp.    Preheat oven to 425. Bring a large saucepan filled with water to a boil.  Plunge spinach into water and cook for 30 seconds. Immediately drain in a  colander and rinse with cold water to halt cooking. Drain again, pressing  against the greens to force out as much water as possible. Set aside.    Break the egg into a bowl. Add the cream, swiss cheese, nutmeg and salt and  pepper to taste and beat with a fork until blended. Coursely chop the  spinach and add to the bowl (I used scissors), stir well.    On a lightly floured board, roll the dough out as thinly as possible.  Sprinkle the Roquefort evenly over the dough. With a fluted pasty cutter  about 1 1/4 inches in diameter, cut out 18 dough rounds (I used one with a  flower/petal shape). Use the rounds to line 18 individual tartlet pans or  the wells in minature muffin pans. Fill each lined pan with some of the egg  mixture and scatter a few pine nuts on top. Place in oven and bake until  the filling sets and the crust is golden, about 15 minutes. Serve warm  (they were also good cold).
