Apricot Bars
Salt, Shortening, White flour, Dried apricots, Walnuts, chopped, Maple syrup, ICING, Cashews, chopped, Cinnamon, Apple juice, Icing sugar, Vanilla, Baking Powder, Brown sugar, 
Sift together flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking powder & salt. Stir in the  apricots & nuts.  Add the syrup. Stir until the mixture forms a thick  batter.    Spread the batter into a lightly oiled 8" X 8" baking pan (it is hard work,  but it will cover -- trust me!). Bake at 350F for 30 to 35 minutes or until  the bars test done. Allow to cool slightly, cut into bars. When completely  cool, spread with icing & drizzle some melted chocolate over the top if  desired.    ICING: Cream together sugar & shortening.  Add remaining ingredients & beat  until smooth.  Makes 1/2 cup.    Recipe by Mark Satterly
