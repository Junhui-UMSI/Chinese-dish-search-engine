Ceviche
Very fresh fish, Onions, sliced in rings, Ripe tomatoes, chopped, Limes, Serrano chillies, Coriander, salt and pepper, 
Cut the fish into 10-15cm cubes. (Yellowfin, tuna, seabass or snapper will  work, mackeral is the traditional fish, but it tends to be too fishy for  most people the less fishy ones will please most people) Chop the tomatoes,  chillies, coriander together as fine as possible. Squeeze the limes. Mix  all together, seasoning and leave for a least and hours at room temp.,  turning frequently to ensure that the fish is evenly treated by the lime  juice, which cooks or pickles it. Refrigerate until served; it will keep  overnight no problem, though 24 hrs is probably the limit. Pour off surplus  lime juice before serving. Serve cold on tortillas, or tostados and garnish  with salad.
