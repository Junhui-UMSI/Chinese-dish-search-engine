Add to butter mixture to make a soft dough.  Refrigerate 30 minutes. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide in half. Shape each half into a roll 8 inches long (about 2 inches  in diameter). Wrap in waxed paper and refigerate several hours or  overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Slice the roll thinly (about 1/4  inch). Place on an ungreased cookie sheet 1 inch apart. Bake 8 - 10 minutes  (watch carefully - dont want them too brown on the bottom - youll have to  experiment with your oven to get the time right). Allow cookies to cool on  the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing from the sheet to a wire  rack. Store in an airtight container if they last long enough to store (I  know they dont last long at my house).    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
