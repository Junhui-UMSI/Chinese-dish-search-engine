Onions, Garlic, Bell peppers, Plum tomatoes, Ground cumin, Brandy, Water, Parmesan cheese, Roasting chicken (3-4 lbs), olive oil, Salt, Black Pepper, Orzo, 
Preheat oven to 450F.    Wash chicken and rub outside and inside with 1 tablespoon olive oil.   Season skin with salt and pepper.    Place chicken in a medium-to-large baking pan, preferably glass or clay, and spread orzo evenly around chicken.    Add remaining oil and other ingredients except cheese and toss in pan to combine.    Place pan, uncovered, in hot oven and reduce heat to 350F.    Bake for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, basting chicken every 10 to 15 minutes with pan juices, until chicken is tender and orzo cooked, adding more water, if necessary, during baking if orzo seems too dry.    Sprinkle with grated cheese before serving.
