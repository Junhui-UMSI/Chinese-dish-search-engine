In Thai "kimao" means drunk. However unlike the Chinese "drunken" dishes,  which are marinated in alcohol, Thai "kimao" dishes are eaten by drunks -  i.e. they are traditional bar food. Sometimes, like this one, they are  believed to "put a lining on your stomach" to allow you to drink more.    Whatever the origin this is an interesting treatment for a whole fish. You  can use any sort of fish. You want one weighing about a pound. Thais leave  the head on.    The chillis used in this are a large chilli called prik chi fa in Thai.  Jalapenos are probably the nearest equivalent if you cant get the Thai  chillis.    The fish is cleaned, the sides slashed and the fish is either dredged in  flour or coated with a light batter, and then deep fried in fairly hot oil  for about five minutes each side. The fish is then removed to a large plate  or serving platter.    Sauce method:    In a medium skillet on medium heat, heat the oil, then add the blended  ingredients, stir continuously for about 3 minutes. add the lime leaves and  the basil, and cook for a further 2 minutes.    Pour the sauce over the fish to serve.    Special thanks to - Muoi Khuntilanont. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #191  by Grayson Mathews <gmathews@uclink4.berkeley.edu> on Jul 24, 1997
