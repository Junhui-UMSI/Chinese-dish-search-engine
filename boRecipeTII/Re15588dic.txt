Adapted from the Passover Gourmet Cookbook    Cut onions, carrots, red peppers, celery, mushrooms and zucchini into  bite-size pieces. Saute in veggie broth for 5 mins. until still slightly  crunchy.  Cut tomatoes into bite-size pieces and add the rest of the  ingredients. Cover and cook for 20 minutes on simmer.    This is delicious served over roasted potatoes. Serve as a vegetarian main  dish and vegetable side dish for others.  This serves about 4 vegetarian  entrees when served with other seder dishes. Increase or substitute  vegetables as desired. (Note: This is my seder main dish.)    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #68    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
