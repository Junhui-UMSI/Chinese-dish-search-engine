I removed all visible fat from the lamb.    *NOTE: Cavatelli or other thin tubular shaped pasta.    Prepare cavatelli according to package directions until al dente. Drain;  rinse with cold water until cool and drain again. Set aside.    In wok or large nonstick saucepan, heat oil. Add onions, garlic and ginger  and cook over med heat about 5 min, until nicely browned. Stir in lamb and  tomatoes and cook about 2 minutes, until lamb loses its rawness. (It  actually took me about 4 - 5 minutes for this step.)    Stir in stock, soy sauce and paprika and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and  simmer stew 5 - 10 min, until richly flavored and lamb is tender. Stir in  cavatelli and simmer 2 min. Stir in spinach leaves and cook 1 min (or  more), until wilted. Adjust seasoning, adding soy sauce or paprika to  taste.    Serving: 4 Prep Time: About 15 min Cooking Time: About 30 min    This is absolutely incredible tasting. Definitely a keeper. I want to try  it without the lamb one time and using chicken breast meat one time to  compare flavor. I will also make it without the meat.
