"Binx" Gardners Cream Pie
Salt, 40% cream, Vanilla, Egg whites, Flour, Sugar, 
Hand beat egg whites until somewhat frothy. Combine flour, sugar  and salt and add to egg whites; beat until smooth, losing grainy  look. Add vanilla. Beat again. Add cream and stir until well blended.  Have ready a baking dish, Pyrex or deep metal pan (milk pan) lined  with a short pastry which has been chilled in refrigerator for some  time. Pour cream mixture into crust and bake in a very slow oven, 250  ~275 degrees F., for 4 hours. It must not boil.  Best done the day  before and allowed to set. :    This cream pie, a fifth or sixth  generation recipe, has a custard like texture and a delicious flavor.  A. K. (Binx) Gardner had the recipe from Mrs. Obadiah Gardner, his  mother, who had it from her mother and grandmother.  The pie is  cooked in a very slow oven for 4 hours and allowed to set for at  least another day before it is served. This is a large pie. A small  "sliver" of the pie makes a good dessert.
