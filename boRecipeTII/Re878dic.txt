source: One of my old recipe files yield: three challahs    Mix yeast, brown sugar, and warm water in a bowl. Let stand for five  minutes, until mixture bubbles. In a mixer bowl, mix both flours and salt.  In a separate bowl, mix eggs, oil, water, and honey. Set aside. Add the  yeast mixture to the flour in the mixer bowl. Add the egg mixture to the  mixer. Mix on medium speed, adding more flour if needed. Dough should be  soft, not sticky. Knead on a flat surface for one minute. Place sough in an  oiled bowl, turning to oil the whole surface. Cover and rise at least two  hours. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Shape into three braided loaves. Brush  with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes.
