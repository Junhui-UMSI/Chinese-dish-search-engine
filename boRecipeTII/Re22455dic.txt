Tuscan Flatbread
olive oil, Water, All-purpose flour, Kosher salt, Active dry yeast, Sugar, 
Just got back from the Disney Institute again and as always, I had a  marvelous time. You guys have got to go! I took: Imagineering!, Radio  Drama, Outdoor Photography, Celebrations!, Boxing Aerobics, Animation  Sampler, Romantic Dinners, Canoe Adventures and Taste of the Word: Bayou.    Wine, Wonder and Song: Italy: This class picks a wine region and then you  proceed to not only learn about the wine from that area but, how to tell  what makes a good wine, how to pair wine with food and listen to music from  the area . No cooking here. The assistant chef prepares for everyone. You  get to sit back and enjoy. I have yet to actually take this class. Both  times I got recipes, I stuck my head in after the class and gave them my  best puppy dog eyes.    Combine sugar, yeast and water. Stir to dissolve the yeast. Mix in the  flour, a little at a time.    Mix in the salt and then knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth.  Let rise in a warm area, until doubled in size.    Oil a sheet pan, punch down the dough, and spread evenly on the pan. Brush  the top of the dough with the olive oil and allow to rise until doubled in  size.    Sprinkle on additional Kosher salt. (to taste)    Bake at 400 degree F for 10 minutes, then top with the chopped herbs.  Continue to bake until golden brown.    Note: Though not to my taste, this was covered with caramelized onions  instead of herbs when it was served.
