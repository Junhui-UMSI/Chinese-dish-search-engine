Beef Curry
Salt, Vegetable oil, Turmeric, Water, Sugar, Currants, Beef fillet, Shallots, ginger, Tomato paste, cilantro leaves, Curry powder, all-purpose flour, Ground cumin, Garlic, Beef broth, Golden Delicious apple;, 
Place 1/4 cup flour, salt, pepper to taste and beef in a plastic food bag.  Seal the bag and shake to coat the beef.    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium high heat.  When hot, sear the beef on all sides, about 2 minutes. Remove from the  skillet and set aside.    Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the skillet. Add shallots, garlic,  ginger, curry powder and apple, and cook, stirring often, until the  shallots are softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons  flour, sugar, cumin and turmeric, and cook 1 minute.    Stir in broth, currants and tomato paste, and simmer, uncovered, until the  mixture has the consistency of sour cream, about 10 minutes. Add water as  needed if the sauce is too thick. Add beef and accumulated juices to the  sauce. (Curry can be prepared to this point and refrigerated up to 2 days  or frozen as long as 1 month. Bring to room temperature before reheating.  Gently reheat until just heated through but not long enough to cook beef  further if rare is preferred. Add water as needed.) Taste and adjust  seasonings. Garnish with cilantro. Serve with assorted chutneys.    NOTES : Can substitute lamb, chicken, turkey or shrimp for the beef with  excellent results.  Hot, fragrant basmati rice is a perfect backdrop for  the spicy curry.
