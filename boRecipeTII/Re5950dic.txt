Pistachio Pesto
Shelled pistachio nuts, Grated Parmesan, Fresh basil, olive oil, Cloves garlic; (up to 3), 
Put all the ingredients in the blender and mix - you might need up to 2/3  c. olive oil. The Parmesan will thicken it up. Serve over hot pasta.    PUMPKIN SEED PESTO: As above, but substitute pumpkin seeds for pistachios.  Add 5 grams of fresh spinach too, if youd like.
