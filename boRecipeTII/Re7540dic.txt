Pork Roast (Korean Chaeyuk Kui)
Sesame oil, Kochu chang, Garlic, black pepper, Pork shoulder, Sesame seeds, Scallions, Sugar, 
This dish is fairly spicy: it gets its highly seasoned flavor from kochee  chang (Red Bean Paste, found in many Oriental food stores. If it is not  available, Japanese miso sauce amy be substituted). Although the amount  indicated is recommended, it is possible to use a little less.    1.  Cut the pork into 4 or 5 slices about 1/4 inch thick.    2.  Mince the scallions. Mince or crush the garlic. Combine both  ingredients with the remaining seasonings in a bowl. Add the pork slices  and mix well until all sides of the pork are coated.    3. Grill immediately or marinate until ready to serve. It is important that  the pork be well done; the outside should be dark, almost charred. A  charcoal, an electric or an oven grill may be used.    Source: The Korean Cookbook, by Judy Hyun.
