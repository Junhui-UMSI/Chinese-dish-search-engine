Into my burrito shell goes: refried black beans, mashed cooked sweet  potato, a few fronds of fresh cilantro, a few grates of cheddar or jack  cheese, the sauce from a tin of chipotles in adobo, to taste, (you can add  onion, tomato, whatever you like).    Bake at about 375 until browned.  (And heres a tip - if youre cooking for  1 or 2 and dont want to heat up the whole oven, use a cast iron skillet or  electric fry pan and just dry roast the babies on the heat, turning to  brown each section.)    I serve with sour cream, a little sliced cuke and hot tomatillo/mango salsa  on the side.  This gets made about once a week and has (despite humble  ingredients and presentation) become a real hit with guests.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
