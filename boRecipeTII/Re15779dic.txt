Place in pan in the order given. Bake on basic bread cycle. This can  probably be timed. With only 2 cups of flour, this makes a small (14 oz)  loaf with a crunchy crust and a light interior.  Not a dense bread. Its a  rustic looking loaf that ought to be just the thing with stews or hearty  soups. *Rye sarter: 2 c Rye flour, 2 c warm water, 1 pkg yeast in a glass  container.  Leave at roomtemp for about 3 days stirring when you think of  it.  When it starts to smell like a brewery, you can refrigerate it. Just  bring it back to room temp before you use it.
