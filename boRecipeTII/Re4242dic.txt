Perfect Roast Potatoes
Mustard powder, Flour, Coarse sea salt, Lard or sunflower oil, Potatoes, peeled, 
Here are some recipes from the Safeway magazine that Ive formatted into  meal master.    Preheat oven to 200C (400F). If the potatoes are very large cut them in  half. Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil, then add the  potatoes and cook for       10    mins. Meanwhile, put the lard in a large roasting tin. Put in  the oven for 10 mins until the fat is sizzling hot. Drain the potatoes and  return to the pan. Cover the pan and shake vigorously to roughen the  outside of all the potatoes. Sprinkle the flour and mustard over the  potatoes and shake the pan again. Put potatoes in the roasting tin, turning  each quickly to coat in the hot fat. Bake for approx. 1 hour or until crisp  and golden on the outside. Sprinkle with sea salt just before serving.
