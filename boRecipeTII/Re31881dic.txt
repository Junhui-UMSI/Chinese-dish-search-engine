Tabasco Pickles
Hamburger Sliced Dill, Tabasco sauce, Sugar, 
Take a regular quart of pickles and drain the juice off the pickles. Add  the sugar and Tabasco Sauce. Let it set for 5 days. Shake or invert the jar  at least twice a day to insure an even coating. This makes a very tasty  pickle. Of course the amount of Tabasco can be adjusted to suit your own  taste.
