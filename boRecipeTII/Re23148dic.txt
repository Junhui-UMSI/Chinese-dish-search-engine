Reserve 1/3 of the  marinade for dressing the vegetables later and a dd the tuna cubes to the  2/3 remaining. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours, refrigerated.    Remove the stems from the mushrooms and cut them into quarters. Thread the  tuna unto the skewers, alternating with the mushrooms, two pieces of tuna  and two mushrooms per skewer.    Using a food slicer, julienne the cucumber and daikon radish into  pasta-like threads and mix with the red pepper julienne. Dress the  vegetables with the reserved marinade and allow to marinate for 20 minutes  before serving.    On a hot outdoor grill or under a broiler, sear the kebabs for two to three  minutes on each side. The tuna should be medium rare still red in the  center.
