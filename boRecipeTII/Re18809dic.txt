Anchovy-Pimiento Spread
Finely chopped pimiento, (3 oz) cream cheese, (2-ounce can) finely chopped, Cream, 
Blend cheese and cream until smooth. Add anchovies and pimiento; mix well.  Chill.    Notes: This cookbook was acquired at a junk sale. It captured my interest  because of the annotated comments beside the recipes. The original owner  had made comments or just check marks beside certain recipes. I will  include these as I scan.
