Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/3 cup water; let proof.  Mix flours and salt  in a large mixing bowl.  Add one cup water to yeast water.  Add water  slowly to flour mixture, stirring until the dough makes a ball. Let the  dough rest five minutes.  Add more flour to make a smooth ball and knead  for seven minutes.  Lete rest two minutes and knead three minutes more.  Place dough in a clean, dry four-quart bowl. Cover and let rise 40 minutes.  Turn dough out; pat into a 14" rectangle and fold in thirds. Repeat. Return  dough to bowl and let rise 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until tripled in bulk. Form  dough into two baguettes, two round loaves, or 12 hard rolls. Slash the top  of each with a razor blade. Preheat oven to 400 F, placing a pan on the  bottom rack to heat. Bake loaves 30 to 35 minutes, steaming the loaves  every four minutes for the first 15 minutes.
