Dredge the trout in the flour until well coated.  Heat the oil in a  large frypan and saute the fish for 5 minutes on each side over medium  heat.    In another pan, melt the butter and saute the almonds until they are  light brown.  Remove from the heat and set aside.  To the fish, add the  wine, lemon juice and pearl onions and cook over low heat for a few  minutes.  Test to see if the fish is done by inserting a knife along the  backbone.  If the flesh comes away easily it is done.    Remove the fish to serving platter.  Season the sauce with salt and  pepper and pour over the fish.  Sprinkle with almonds and serve  immediately.
