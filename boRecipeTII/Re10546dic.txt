Quick Lunch- Zuchini and Corn Curry
Salt, 8 small zucchini in 1/2 inch, (leave peel on), Kernels (1/4*1/2 bag), (I use 1-2*teaspoons), Curry powder of your choice, To 1/2 pound frozen corn, 
Fill a microwave container with the zucchini. Top of with corn. There  should be more zucchini than corn. Generously sprinkle with curry powder.  Add some salt, if you like. Before cooking, mix thoroughly. Microwave on  high for about 8 minutes.    Serve with fresh bread or over rice; or make enough be a whole meal, which  is what I did today. Back to eating!
