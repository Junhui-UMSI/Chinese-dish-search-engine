Asparagus salad is typical of many Chinese vegetable salads, in that the  vegetable is first steamed, then cooled, before slicing and dressing.    Wash asparagus spears.  Use sharp paring knife to peel off tough white skin  on lower stem and cut off the very end. When steamer is hot, steam spears  until barely cooked. They are overcooked when the color is olive. Remove  from steamer, drain any water, and cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, mix  dressing ingredients in small bowl. Slice pickled red ginger into thin  slivers.  About ten minutes before serving, slice spears on the bias into  2" segments.  Place on serving dish, intermingled with pickled ginger. Pour  dressing over asparagus, and let it permeate the salad. Serve at room  temperature.  This salad can also be served while asparagus is still warm,  or it can be chilled.
