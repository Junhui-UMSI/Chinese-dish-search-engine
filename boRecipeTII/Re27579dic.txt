The Best Blueberry Muffins
Granulated sugar, Nutmeg, Vanilla, Blueberries, milk, Butter, Eggs, Flour, Salt, Sugar, Baking Powder, 
Bursting with berries, these are the best blueberry muffins of all. The  secret is an extra half cup of blueberries, which are mashed and then added  to the batter.    Mash 1/2 cup blueberries with a fork.  Mix 1 tablespoon sugar with nutmeg.    Heat oven to 375 F. Grease 12 regular muffin cups, including the area  between each cup, or use foil baking cups.    In a medium-size bowl, beat butter until creamy. Beat in the sugar until  pale and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in vanilla, baking  powder, and salt.    Mix mashed berries into batter.    Fold in half the flour with a spatula, then half the milk. Add the  remaining flour and milk. Fold in remaining blueberries.    Scoop batter into muffin cups. Sprinkle with nutmeg sugar.    Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Let muffins cool at least 30  minutes in the pan before removing.
