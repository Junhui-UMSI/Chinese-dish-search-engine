Thursday Night Omelet
American cheese; diced, Bacon drippings, Strips bacon, Onion; minced, Green pepper; minced, Eggs, 
Fry bacon until crisp; drain on paper towel. Drain off fat in greased  skillet, saute onions and green peppers until soft. Using wire whisk, beat  eggs until fluffy; add salt and pepper to taste. Pour beaten eggs into hot  copper bottom skillet that has been coated with 2 tablespoons bacon  drippings. (Hot pan will set bottom of omelet.) Immediately reduce heat to  low. As the outer edges of omelet set, gently lift with a spatula, allowing  uncooked portions to get to heating surface. When top is a almost done,  sprinkle onions and peppers on half the omelet; top with crumbled bacon.  Lastly, sprinkle on diced cheese. With spatula, fold omelet in half,  folding plain side over filled side, closing in all the stuffing. Heat will  melt the cheese. Serve with buttered toast.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.
