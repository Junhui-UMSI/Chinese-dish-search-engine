However, here is a recipe I adapted from "The Best Pressure Cooker Cookbook  Ever" that we really like. I dont recommend buying the book unless you  find it at a great sale price as there are a LOT of recipes not suitable  for vegetarians.    1. Combine the drained beans, 4 cups water, and hot pepper flakes in the  pressure cooker. Cover and bring up to high pressure. Reduce heat to  stabilize pressure and cook 5 minutes. Release pressure by running cold  water over the cover. Drain beans and set aside.    2. Heat the broth in the pressure cooker over medium heat. Add the onion  and garlic and cook uncovered until they begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add mushroom, carrots, and basil; cook 2 minutes. Add beans, the tomatoes  with their liquid, spinach, salt and pepper.    3. Cover and bring up to high pressure. Reduce heat to stabilize pressure  and cook 4 minutes. Release pressure.    If you remember to put start soaking beans in the morning - it doesnt take  long to get dinner on the table in the evening.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Richard M.
