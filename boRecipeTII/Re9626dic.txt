Pumpkin Kibbeh
Flour, Coriander, olive oil, Allspice, Pepper, Garlic, Onion chopped, Mashed pumpkin or squash, Fine bulgar (soak in boiling, Cumin, Cayenne, 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the pumpkin, buglar, salt, pepper,  coriander, allspice, cumin, cayenne, onion, garlic, and flour in a food  processer until thoroughly blended. (Alternatively, in a large bowl mix all  these ingredients by hand.) Taste for seasoning and add more salt or spices  as required. If the mixture seems to moist, add a little bit more flour and  mix it in.    Grease an 8-inch square pan with olive oil. Pour the mixture into it,  smooth the surface and pour a tablespoon of olive oil over the top. Bake  for 20 to 25 minutes or until the surface looks dry. (The inside will be  moist.) Alternatively you can form the mixture into 2-inch patties and fry  them in olive oil.    This makes a great main dish for those of us who not eat meat. I also do  not add olive oil to mine, so that it stays into the guidelines of eating  fat free.
