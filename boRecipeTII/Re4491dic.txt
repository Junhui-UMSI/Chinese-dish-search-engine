Pesto Sauce #1
garlic, Parmesan cheese, -(up to), -(up to), olive oil, fresh basil leaves, Pine nuts, 
Place basil in food processor or blender. (Blender method - partially chop  leaves before putting in blender jar.) Add pine nuts, garlic and cheese.  Blend until ingredients form a thick paste. You may need to scrape down the  sides of the container during this process. Next, add the olive oil slowly  through the feeding tube or cover hole in the blender. Add oil only until  it forms a thick sauce. Add to your favorite pasta and toss. A good measure  is 3 Tablespoons per serving of pasta. To store, pour into jars and pour a  thin coating of olive oil over top of sauce. Put tops on jars and place in  refrigerator or freezer.  This sauce will keep indefinitely in refrigerator  or freezer as long as there is a seal of olive oil on top of the sauce.  Yield: 3-1/2 to 4 cups.    BEN HUSSMAN (MRS. WALTER, JR.)
