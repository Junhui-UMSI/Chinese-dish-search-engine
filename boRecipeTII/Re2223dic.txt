Baked Carrots and Potatoes
Butter, Carrots, Salt, Sweet paprika, Onion, Water, Butter, Evaporated milk, Baking potatoes, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and butter a 8x8 inch baking dish. Place  the vegetables in the prepared dish,and dot with the remaining butter. Mix  the seasonings with the milk and water, and pour over the vegetables. Bake,  stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are very tender and the top is  lightly browed.    This will take at least an hour and perhaps longer. You want the potatoes  to absorb much of the milk and flavoings; if you use a deep dish this will  take longer, but the result will be slightly richer.
