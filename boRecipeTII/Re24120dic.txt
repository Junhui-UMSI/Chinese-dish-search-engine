Traditional Hamantaschen
All-purpose flour, Milk -- scalded, Eggs -- slightly beaten, Envelope dry yeast, Butter, Egg yolk, Milk -- lukewarm, Sugar, Salt, 
Dissolve the yeast in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm milk, making certain that the  milk is not too warm.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of sugar and set aside. In a  deep mixing bowl, combine the butter, remaining sugar, salt and scalded  milk, and stir until all are blended.  When lukewarm, stir in the yeast.  Add the eggs and about 2 cups of the flour, and beat to a smooth batter.  Add remaining flour to make a tender dough.  Turn out on a floured board  and knead for about 2 minutes.  Grease a large mixing bowl; grease whole  surface of the large ball of dough and place dough in bowl. Cover. Let rise  in a warm, not hot, place, to double its bulk. (Takes from 2 to 4 hours.)  Again knead on a floured board for about a minute. Roll out 1/8 of an inch  thick.  Cut into 3- to 4-inch circles.      Place filling on each. Recipe  for Mohn Filling follow.  To shape true hamantaschen, pinch eges of a  circle together over filling, leaving about 1/2 open, forming a cornucopia.  Then fold over the flap and pinch these edges firmly together. Arrange well  apart on a greased cookie sheet. Cover with a cloth and let rise again in a  wam place to double in bulk. Brush tops with the egg yolk, thinned with a  little water.  Bake in a moderate oven (350F) for 15 to 20 minutes. Makes  2 to 2 1/2 dozen.
