Cheesy Broccoli-Cauliflower Bread
Lemon juice, Green onion, Vegetable oil, Egg white, Cheddar cheese, Cauliflower, Bread flour, quick-rising yeast, Water, Broccoli, Lemon-pepper seasoning, 
All ingredients should be at room temperature.  Place in pan in order  suggested by machines manual.    Because the moisture content of vegetables varies a lot, it is important to  watch the amount of liquid used.  Do not add any extra liquid until the  machine has kneaded long enough to extract liquid from the vegetables. At  first, the dough appears dry, even crumbly, but it is easy to see the  vegetables begin to release their moisture and the dough ball form. If a  soft, round, slightly tacky ball has not formed near the end of kneading,  more liquid can be added one tablespoon at a time.
