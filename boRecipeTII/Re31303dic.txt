1. Put the ginger inside the cavity of the chicken, then rub the outside of  the bird with salt and pepper. Place the bird in a large saucepan and  sprinkle over half of the soy sauce. Leave to stand for 30 minutes.    2. Pour enough water into the pan to just cover the chicken. Bring to the  boil, then lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 1 hour until the  chicken is tender. Leave to cool in the cooking liquid, then remove.    3. Separate the legs and wings from the carcass, then cut the carcass into  fours. Bang the pieces several times with a rolling pin to loosen the meat  from the bones.    4. Cut the meat into neat slices (not too small) or strips. Discard the  bones and skin. Combine with carrots and beansprouts.    5. Heat the oils in a heavy-based pan, add the sesame seeds and chilies,  and fy over brisk heat for a few minutes, stirring until lightly colored.  Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining soy sauce with the sugar and  sherry.    6. Pour over the chicken and vegetables, cover and marinate in the  refrigerator overnight.    7. To serve, put the chicken and vegetables into a shallow serving dish,  lined with lettuce leaves. Pour over any remaining marinade and garnish  with scallion tassels. Serve cold.
