Form into a loaf and set aside on cookie  sheet to cool. (overnight in refrigerator is fine).    Add flour.  Mix well. Make into patties of1/2 c. each.  Pat with hands  until it doesnt crack at edges (knead) Roll out on pastry cloth with  corrugated rolling pin into a 12"-14" circle Bake on a 500 degree dry  griddle. There should be some definite brown spots. Remove lefse and set  under towel to hold in some moisture.    It is critical to use a lefse stick to lift the lefse onto and off the  griddle. You can make a lefse stick by sanding the edges off of about 18"  of a wooden yardstick - like a giant table knife.You simply slide the stick  under the lefse to move it.    My family cant have Christmas without lefse    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
