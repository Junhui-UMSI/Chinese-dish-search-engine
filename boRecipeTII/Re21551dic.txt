Apple Pork Chops
Butter, Pork chop fat, Apples, Sugar, Cinnamon, Pork Chops, 
Cook the chops using melted fat trimmed from the meat and 1 tsp butter.  (Note from Anne MacLellan; those concerned about their fat intake may chose  to use corn oil or some other vegetable oil rather than the pork fat).  Season to taste and set on hot platter. Keep warm.   Slice the apples 1/2" thick and add to the pan with 1 tsp butter, the  sugar and a few pinches of cinnamon or cloves. Cook over medium heat for  about 10 minutes, turning once or twice until some of apples are browned.  Arrange them around the chops and serve. Serves: 4-6
