Cook slowly until cereal is done.  Pour into  large bowl and whip at highest speed until very light and fluffy-about 20  minutes.  Sweeten to taste.  If using a non-tart juice such as apple, add  lemon juice to taste.  Serve with milk when chilled.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #85    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
