Mix the minced onions with soft butter and spread inside  and outside the fish.    Lay the bacon strips on the bottom of a shallow baking dish and lay in the  fish.    In a bowl mix the sour cream, thyme, grated cheese, bread crumbs, and lemon  juice and spread the mixture over the fish. Bake at 325 degrees for about  30 minutes.
