Spray 9x13 (or a little smaller) pan with Pam.  Mix  all ingredients, pat thinly on bottom of pan, sprinkle with extra cinnamon  and bake for 30 minutes. WAIT TO COOL before removing or they will crumble.  For a fat substitute we have used 1/2 cup of frozen cranberries thawed in a  little water with a bit of sugar, mashed bannanas, mashed berries, you  could even puree a few pears in some sauce.
