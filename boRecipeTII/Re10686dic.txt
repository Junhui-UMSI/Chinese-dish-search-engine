Add the above starter ingredients to the ABM and let knead for about 10  minutes. Reset the machine (turn it off) and leave the pan in the machine  overnight or 6-8 hours.    Add remaining ingredients and start machine as usual. If making the loaf in  the Machine use the specialty bread setting and add the raisins at the  beep. (If you add them to early they get ground up) You can usually find  the gluten, rye flour and whole wheat flour in a health food store or you  can buy it mail order from King Arthur Flour 800-827-6836    If you are going to make rolls use the dough setting. The raisins are very  good in the rolls. Using the dough setting on my Hitachi I add them at the  1:18 mark. When the dough is ready roll out into a flat square. Form into  balls the size of a large Lemon. Press down and cover (I put 12 into a 13x9  pan and the rest in a cake pan. Let rise until doubled (1 hour) then cook       20    minutes at 350.    Makes about 15 rolls.    Posted to recipelu-digest by Kara9718 <Kara9718@aol.com> on Mar 28, 1998
