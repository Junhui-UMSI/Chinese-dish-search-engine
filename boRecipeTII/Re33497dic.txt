Sushi Rice Pt 2

another 15 minutes.    To Season Rice:    With the rice paddle, gently spread out the hot rice in a shallow,  large-bottomed non-metallic bowl or platter. The large surface is necessary  so that the rice can cool quickly and the material must not be metal,  because the vinegar will react with it, creating a bad taste.    As the steam is escaping, sprinkle the sushi vinegar over the rice, and  with quick horizontal motions scooping back and forth along the bottom,  toss the rice with the sushi vinegar.    Immediately start to cool the rice by fanning it with a piece of cardboard  or a paper fan. Fan the rice for 2 minutes.    Cover the rice loosely with a clean wet towel and let it stand for about 15  minutes or until the rice is room temperature.    Keep the rice covered with the damp cloth if it is not to be used  immediately.
