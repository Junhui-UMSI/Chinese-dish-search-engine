Preheat oven to 350F. Scald milk, stir hot milk into bread crumbs. Add  butter and mix well. Let cool to lukewarm. Add salt, brown sugar, eggs and  flavorings, mix well. Fold in peaches. Pour into a buttered 9" casserole  dish and bake 1 hour. Serve warm with Butterscotch Sauce.    Butterscotch Dessert Sauce: Heat all ingredients except vanilla to boiling  over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil, stirring frequently, 5  minutes; remove from heat. Stir in vanilla; cool completely.    Source: Betty Crocker Cookbook    Notes (plm): The original recipe from Susan Gruenwald called for 3 cups of  fresh peaches, thinly sliced, 1 cup of DARK brown sugar and did not call  for the seasonings, other than cinnamon.    In addition, the Butterscotch Sauce originally called for 1 tablespoon rum  or 1 teaspoon of rum flavoring - as we had neither, I substituted the  vanilla.
