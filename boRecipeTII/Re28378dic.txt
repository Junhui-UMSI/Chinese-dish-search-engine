1. Trim leeks about 2 inches beyond point where leaves start to darken.  Trim root end, keeping base intact.    2. Slit leek lengthwise upward through leaves, leaving base intact. By  trimming only dark green parts of each half, more of leek can be saved.    3. Soak trimmed leeks in a sinkful of cold water to loosen excess dirt,  then rinse leeks in cold running water, pulling apart layers with your  fingers to expose any clinging dirt.    4.Arrange leeks in a single layer in a steamer basket or steamer insert.  Carefully place basket over pot of vigorously boiling water-, cover and  steam until tip of knife inserted in thickest part of leek meets no  resistance, about 10 minutes for leeks I inch thick, about 12 minutes for  leeks 1 1/4 inches thick.    5. Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Fry  bacon in small skillet over medium-high heat until fat is rendered and  bacon is crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain fat and set bacon aside to cool.    6. Whisk egg, milk, chicken stock, and salt and pepper to taste in small  bowl. Stir in Gruyerere cheese.    7. Arrange leeks in a single layer in baking dish. Pour egg mixture over    leeks, sprinkle with bacon bits and bread crumbs. Bake until top is browned  and egg mixture is set, about 30 minutes.
