Fill boiling water canner with water. Place 6 clean half-pint (250 mL)  mason jars in canner. Cover, bring water to a boil; boil at least 10  minutes to sterilize jars at altitudes up to 1,000 ft. Wash, hull and crush  ripe berries, one layer at a time; measure strawberries. Wash and finely  chop rhubarb; measure rhubarb. Place BERNARDIN Snap Lids in boiling water;  boil 5 minutes to soften sealing compound. Place fruit in a large, deep  stainless steel or enamel saucepan. Add lemon juice. Measure sugar; set  aside. Stir BERNARDIN Fruit Pectin into prepared fruit. Bring fruit/pectin  mixture to a full boil over high heat; stirring constantly. Add sugar;  return to full, rolling boil. Boil hard 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove cooked mixture from heat. Skim off foam with metal spoon. Ladle into  a hot sterilized jar to within 1/4 inch of top rim (head space). Remove air  bubbles by sliding rubber spatula between glass and food; readjust head  space to 1/4 inch. Wipe jar rim to remove any stickiness. Center BERNARDIN  Snap Lid on jar; apply screw band just until fingertip tight. Place jar in  canner. Repeat for remaining jars. Cover canner; return water to boil.  Process 5 minutes at altitudes up to 1,000 feet (305 m). Remove jars. Cool,  undisturbed, for 24 hours. Check jar seals. (Sealed lids curve downward.)  Remove screw bands, store separately.
