Allow the ice cream to defrost slightly -- put it in  the bottom part of the refrigerator instead of the freezer. Whip the cream  until stiff. In another bowl, beat the vanilla ice cream with a wooden  spoon. Fold in the whipped cream, lemon juice, and remaining Cointreau and  blend until smooth. Pour the whipped ice cream over the chilled  strawberries. Serve at once.    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #137    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
