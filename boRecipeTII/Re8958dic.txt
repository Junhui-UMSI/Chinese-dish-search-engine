Pressure Cooker Custard
Milk; scalded, Sugar, Salt, Vanilla, Nutmeg, Eggs; slightly beaten, 
Mix eggs, sugar, vanilla and salt.  Stir in milk gradually. Pour into four  6-oz. custard cups.  Sprinkle tops with nutmeg. Place cups on rack with 1/2  cup water in 6 or 8 qt. pressure cooker. (Cook only two at a time in 2 1/2  ~ 4qt. cooker.) Cover cooker, set control at 5 lbs. pressure and cook for  exactly 2 1/2 minutes after control starts to jiggle (or at 15 lbs  pressure, remove cooker from heat as soon as control jiggles or rocks  gently). Cool cooker for 5 minutes, then place under faucet. NOTE: To vary  custard, substitute brown sugar (packed) for granulated sugar. Or top  custard with chocolate, caramel or pineapple ice cream topping, fresh,  canned or thawed frozen fruit or maple flavored syrup.
