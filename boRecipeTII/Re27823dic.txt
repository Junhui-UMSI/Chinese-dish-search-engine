The Ultimate Chocolate Pudding
milk, Salt, Pure vanilla extract, Cornstarch, semisweet chocolate, Heavy cream, Sugar, Unsweetened dutch process cocoa, 
Working over a large bowl, sift 1/2 cup of the sugar with the cocoa,  cornstarch and salt. Whisk in 1/2 cup of the milk to make a smooth paste;  scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to be sure everything  is well mixed.    Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a medium saucepan, combine the  heavy cream with the remaining 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/4 cup of sugar and  bring just to a simmer over moderately high heat, stirring. Reduce the heat  to moderately low and stir in the cocoa paste. Whisking constantly, boil  the mixture for 1 minute. Strain the mixture over the chocolate in the  bowl. Add the vanilla and stir until the pudding is smooth.    Pour the pudding into six glasses or 1-cup ramekins and let cool to room  temperature. Cover the puddings and refrigerate until set, at least 4  hours. The puddings can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.
