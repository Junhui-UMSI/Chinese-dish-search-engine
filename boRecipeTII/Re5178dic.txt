From: robert.foster@nashville.com (Robert Foster)    Date: 7 Aug 1995 12:17:05 -0500  I found this recipe in my database & hope that its what your looking for.  I have not tried this recipe, therefore, I can not answer any questions  about it. Enjoy!    Cream butter and sugar together until very soft. Then carefully blend in  the ground almonds, salt, vanilla and flour. The dough will be rather firm.  Cut off pieces about the size of prunes and roll them into little  cigar-shaped pieces about 1/2-inch thick. Roll these in the chopped pine  nuts and bend them into a half-moon shape. Place these 1-inch apart on  greased baking pans. Bake at 350F for 15-to-20 minutes. The crescents  should not be browned. Cool about 5 minutes, then strew with a little  granulated sugar or brush with heavily sweetened milk.    NOTE: For reasons never adequately explained, cake and other baked foods  need more flour on some days than on others.
