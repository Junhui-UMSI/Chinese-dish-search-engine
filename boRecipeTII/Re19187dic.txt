"Fry"  1 onion, 2 cloves of garlic and 4 sticks of celery in a pan until the onion  is clear, add 1 red and 1 green pepper (diced) and 1 cup of beans, chopped  into small strips. Add 1 and 1/2 cups of uncooked rice with 2 cups of  vegetable stock. Let simmer for 3-4 minutes    Add 1 440gm can of tomatoes, 1/4/ cup of lemon juice, a couple of strands  of saffron, some paprika (I just throw in quite a bit),1 440 gm can of  artichoke hearts (I buy them in water) and some olives (I use a handful of  chopped black ones, which I also buy in water.) Allow to cook on a  relatively high temperature, covered for 15-20 minutes.    There should be lots of liquid at the beginning of this period, which will  allow the rice to cook. Use the texture of the rice as a guide. I use a  plain organic brown rice, which seems to work, although basmati rice was  the type recommended in the original recipe.    Before serving, add a handful of fresh parsely and stir. Serve with wedges  of lemon (and a good bottle of red wine!) Sorry for being so general, but I  have adapted it quite a bit from the original recipe and this is how I made  it last night. One of the key benefits is that non vegetarians dont notice  the lack of m**t.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #146    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
