Puree half the punnet of strawberrys,  strain, and add this to the orange juice and leave it on the stove till its  all warmed through. With the rest of the strawberrys, chop them roughly and  just throw them in the mixture.    When its warm, not *HOT* just pour it over whatever dessert your having. It  goes well with the crepes, especially if you have a little bit of whipped  cream as well. You could even try adding a little Grand Mariner if you  wanted, but I havent tried this, yet.
