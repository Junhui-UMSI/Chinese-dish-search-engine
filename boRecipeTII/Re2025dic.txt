African Bean Soup
Onions, Sliced carrots, Dried black eyed peas, Diced green pepper, Water, 
I just made was from Veggies Unite:    water-saute onions and carrots till onions are soft. Add rest.    simmer 1-1/2 hours    salt to taste.    stir a spoonful of peanut butter into each serving.    The fat content entirely depends on the amount of peanut butter added - so,  for kids, you can add more.    Very good served with corn muffins.
