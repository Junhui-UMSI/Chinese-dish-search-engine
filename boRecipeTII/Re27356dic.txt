*technically speaking, all cashews must be slightly coked before being  sold. Buy the ones called "raw" in the store.    Spread the cashews about 1/4" thick on a shallow baking dish or pie pan.  bake for 10-15 minutes at 300F, stirring once. Blend the cashews, 1/4 cup  at a time in the blender until finely ground. Add all the ingredients to  the blender and liquefy. Heat the sauce on medium-low heat, stirring  regularly. When thickened and hot throughout, serve over vegetables, grains  or other main dishes. Keeps 6-8 days in refrigerator.    MAKES: 3 cups SOURCE: _Vegan Delights_ by Jeanne Marie Martin posted by  Anne MacLellan
