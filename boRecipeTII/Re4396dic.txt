Place tomatoes in a blender or a food processor fitted with the metal blade  and process until liquefied. Set aside.    Heat oil in a large saucepan or stockpot over moderate heat. Add onion and  saute until soft, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute for another 2  minutes. Add cumin, oregano and bay leaf and stir to combine. Sprinkle  chicken pieces with salt and pepper and add to pan. Brown the chicken  lightly. Add the tomatoes and enough water to cover 3/4 of chicken.

Serve warm. Posted to MM-Recipes  Digest V3 #4.TXT  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #045 by Julie Bertholf  <jewel1@ix.netcom.com> on Feb 13, 1997.
