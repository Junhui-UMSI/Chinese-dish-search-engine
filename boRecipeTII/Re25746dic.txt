Prick the eggplant in several places with a fork, place it on a baking  sheet , and broil in a preheated broiler for about 20 minutes, turning the  vegetable several times so that the skin chars on all sides. Let the  eggplant cool.    2. When the eggplant is cool enough to handle, cut it in half and scrape  out the flesh into a bowl, discard the skin, and mash the eggplant with the  tahini, lemon juice, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper. Cover the mixture and  refrigerate it.    3. Before serving, sprinkle the spread with the oil, if desired, and minced  parsley, and serve it with pita, fresh or toasted, or as a dip for fresh  vegetables.
