Witches Brew Marinade
Salt and pepper to taste, Vinegar, Mustard (any creamy kind), Bottled french dressing, Cooking oil, Onion salt to taste, Soy sauce, Garlic salt to taste, Ketchup, Brown sugar, Worcestershire Sauce, Meat tenderizer 1/2 t per, Lemon juice, 
Mix well. Marinate meat for a minimum of four hours.    Here is the absolute best meat marinade I have ever had...I found it in  "Delicious Decisions" the cookbook of the Jr. League of San Diego. I find  that very, very inexpensive London Broil (even bottom round & shoulder) is  almost butter tender when marinaded in this overnight then grilled  (although broiling is almost as good). Slice thin across the grain & youll  surely impress guests! From goober273@aol.com Sat Apr 20 05:07:26 1996
