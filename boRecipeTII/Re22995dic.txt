Trout and Sour Cream
Fish per person, Sour cream, Unsalted butter per fish, Water per fish, Salt and pepper, 
The fish should be very fresh, gutted and scaled but not split. Melt the  butter.  When it foams, slip in the fish.  Brown swiftly, turning once.  Pour the sour cream and water around them, add salt and freshly ground  pepper, and let the fish simmer for 10 minutes.    Serve with small new potatoes boiled in their jackets:  or chanterelle  mushrooms fried in butter (if you can get them).    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mm-trout.zip
