Bar-Bq Ranch Sauce
fresh Jalapenos, Salt, Ketchup, Worcestershire Sauce, fresh serranos, Ground cumin, Onions, Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice, Chili powder, Garlic, black coffee, Cider vinegar, Unsulphured dark molasses, yellow mustard, 
In a saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onions, chiles, and  garlic, and saute over medium heat until everything is softened. Mix in the  remaining ingredients and bring the sauce to a simmer. Cover and cook for  35 to 40 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool briefly. Strain the sauce and  puree the solids in a food processor. Return the pureed mixture to the  sauce, stirring thoroughly. Refrigerate the sauce overnight to allow the  flavors to mingle and mellow. Use the sauce warm or chilled. It keeps for  weeks.    * Variation: If you prefer a thinner sauce, water this down to your  preferred consistency. It will still pack plenty of pizzazz.    ~ SOURCE: SMOKE AND SPICE    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #232 by Michael McLaughlin  <mmclaughlin@micronet.net> on Sep 01, 1997
