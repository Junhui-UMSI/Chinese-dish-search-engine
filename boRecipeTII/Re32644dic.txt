Peel the shrimp and set them aside.    Place the creamy mixture ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth  and creamy.    Preheat a heavy 10-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over high heat to 350  F, about 4 minutes.    Add the onions, 1/4 CUP EACH of the red, yellow, and green bell peppers,  and 1 TABLESPOON PLUS 1 TEASPOON of the seasoning mix. Stir, and cook 3  minutes. Add the stock, 1/2 CUP of the apple juice, and the garlic, scrape  the bottom of the skillet to clear it of all brown bits, and cook until  most of the liquid evaporates, about 12 minutes. Add 1/2 CUP apple juice,  scrape the bottom to clear it, and cook 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture  from the skillet to a blender, add dry milk, and puree until smooth.    Return the pureed mixture to the skillet over high heat, and stir in the  REMAINING bell peppers and the REMAINING 1/2 CUP apple juice. Cook,  scraping the bottom occasionally to keep the mixture from sticking, for 7  minutes. Add the remaining seasoning mix and shrimp, stir, and cook 3  minutes. Stir in the creamy mixture.    CAUTION: Dishes using these creamy mixtures can "break" or curdle easily if  they are brought to a full boil. Therefore, bring the liquid just to a  gentle boil, about 3 minutes, and stir immediately. Reduce the heat to  medium and cook, stirring continuously, until the shrimp are plump and  firm, about 2 minutes.    Turn off the heat. Remove 1 cup of liquid, strain it, and puree it with the  nonfat mayonnaise. Stir this mixture back into the mixture in the skillet.    Serve over the rice or pasta.
