Heat oven to 350 F. Put almonds on a baking sheet pr pie pan and bake about  5 minutes, just until lightly browned; watch carefully so almonds dont  burn. (You can also toast them in a toaster oven.) Slide almonds off the  baking sheet so they cool quickly.    Grease muffin cups, or use foil or paper baking cups.    Thoroughly mix flour, sugar, pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and  salt in a large bowl.    Break eggs into another bowl. Add pumpkin and butter, and whisk until well  blended. Stir in chocolate chips and almonds. Pour over dry ingredients and  fold in with a rubber spatula just until dry ingredients are moistened.    Scoop batter evenly into muffin cups. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until  puffed and springy to the touch in the center. Turn out onto a rack to  cool. Wrap in a plastic bag and keep for 1 or 2 days. Reheat before  serving.
