Cut into small  squares, rounds, diamonds, etc. Glaze pieces by placing upside down,  a few at a time, on a wire rack over a large bowl or baking dish.  Pour icing over top so entire cake is covered at one time. Icing that  drips off can be reheated & reused. Decorate tops with candy toppings  or decorators icing.    Icing: Combine ingredients in top of a double boiler & heat over  boiling water just to lukewarm. Remove from heat, leaving icing over  hot water to keep it thin. Tint if desired with food coloring.
