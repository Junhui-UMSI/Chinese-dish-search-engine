Pineapple-Pecan Fudge
Pecans -- chopped, Vanilla extract, Sugar, Margarine, Crushed pineapple --, Drained, Heavy cream, 
1. Use a 14-ounce can of crushed pineapple. Invert over a sieve placed in  bowl to drain pineapple thoroughly. 2. Chop the pecans coarsely. 3. Combine  the drained pineapple, sugar and cream in a heavy saucepan. Stir over low  heat until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat and bring mixture to boiling.  Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Continue until mixture  reaches 234 degrees on a candy thermometer (soft ball stage). This will  stick a little but DO NOT scrape bottom and sides of pan; brushing down  side of pan occasionally will help. 4. Remove from heat and let cool just  until cool enough that you can touch pan without being burned. DO NOT stir  or disturb mixture in any way while this is cooling. 5. Add the margarine  (or butter) and the vanilla extract. Beat vigorously until the candy loses  its gloss. Stir in the pecans using as little mixing as possible. 6.  Immediately pour into 8 x 8-inch pan that has been greased with margarine.  Do not scrape the bottom or sides of pan as you are putting the mixture  into dish. 7. Let cool completely, then cut into small pieces for serving.    Yield: About twenty-four 1-1/2 inch squares.
