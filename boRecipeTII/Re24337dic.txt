Triple Mushroom Burger
mushrooms, Pecans, Garlic, Hoisin sauce, Salt, onion, Red bell pepper, basmati rice, Jalapeno, Canola oil, Dry bread crumbs, 
Dry-pan roast the pecans.  When cooled, process to a coarse powder.    Heat oil in a large skillet. Saute onion and garlic until onions turn brown  at the edges and garlic is golden. Add jalapeno, bell pepper and mushrooms.  Reduce heat, cover and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to15 minutes.  Add hoisin sauce and mix well.    With a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a large bowl. Increase heat  and reduce the sauce remaining in the skillet until very thick, stirring  often for 5 to 10 minutes. Pour sauce over the vegetable mixture. Place  mixture and rice in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse several times until  the ingredients are thoroughly blended. Transfer to a large bowl and mix in  ground pecans and 1-1/4 cup crumbs, with your hands. Season with salt.    Form into 3-inch patties about 1/2-inch thick, mixing in extra crumbs if  patties dont hold their shape. They will be delicate, so handle gentle.    Broil or grill patties until brown on both sides and heated through. Served  on toasted buns with lettuce, onion and ketchup.  Makes 12.    Pat Hs notes.  Try chipotle mayo and sliced tomato.    Shape with burger  press and waxed paper; freeze; fry (frozen patty) with a little vegetable  spray.

"Just throw them in the processor." A blender       wont work (needs too much water).
