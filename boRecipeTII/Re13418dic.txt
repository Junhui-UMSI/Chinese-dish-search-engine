Recipe By : WASHINGTON COUNTY FAIR KITCHEN (OKLAHOMA)    Soften shortening in the hot water and let cool till lukewarm.    Sprinkle yeast over water to which about a teaspoon of sugar has been  added. Let stand till it foams up good.    Combine the flour, sugar, powdered milk, potatoes, salt and baking powder  in a large mixing bowl.    Add shortening and water to flour mixture until smooth, then add slightly  beaten eggs; again blend until smooth. (This can all be done in electric  mixer). Add yeast mixture which has started to foam good. Again beat until  smooth. Add small amounts of flour until you have a soft dough (this can be  done with the mixer but dont overwork mixer until youve burned your motor  out). After it gets too stiff for the mixer continue adding flour and  mixing with spoon until it is thick enough to turn out on floured board.  Knead until smooth and elastic (at least 8 to 10 minutes). Add flour a  little bit at a time so dough wont get too stiff. Use just enough flour to  keep it from sticking to the board. Put in a greased bowl, greasing the top  of dough, and let rise until double in size (usually 1 to 1 1/2 hours).    Make into rolls and let rise again until double in size (usually 45 minutes  to 1 hour.) Bake 375? 12 to 15 minutes. Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #759  by C4 <c4@groupz.net> on Aug 24, 1997
