Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Butter a 8 or 9 inch springform pan. Put the  berries in the springform pan, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup of sugar. Put  aside.  Beat the melted butter with the egg yolks. In a separate bowl beat  the egg whites, add salt and cram of tartar. Beat the egg whites until  stiff, and then fold in the remaining sugar (1 cup). Add the flour 1/4 at a  time , alternating with the egg yolk mixture. Pour the cake mixture over  the berries and bake for 1 hour (or 1 hr. 10 minutes ) at 325 degrees.  REmove from spring form pan. Spoon juice over the cake, add the preserves  and whipping cream as a topping.    From Lee Bailey. This is an old southern dish that was also common in the  Maritimes. It is a cooked short cake for strawberries. Really, by cooked  they mean that the strawberries are cooked in the oven. I consider that the  preserves in the whipping cream is superfluous.
