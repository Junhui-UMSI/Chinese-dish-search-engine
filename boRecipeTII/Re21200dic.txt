Cucumbers, olive oil, Fresh mint leaves, Plain full fat yogurt, Sea salt, fresh garlic, Black Pepper, 
Drain yogurt for 1 hour in a cheeseclothlined strainer to remove some of  its water. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt over the grated cucumber and  drain, 10 to15 minutes, to extract excess water. Add drained cucumber to  yogurt, along with pepper, and mix well. Cover and refrigerate until  chilled, about 1 hour. Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with mint leaves.  Serve with pita triangles or grilled fish.
