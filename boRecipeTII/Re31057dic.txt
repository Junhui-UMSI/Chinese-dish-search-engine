Banana Pineapple Loaf
Flour (shifted), Baking Powder, Butter, Pecans, chopped, optional, Banana (mashed), Coconut, optional, Pineapple (15.5 oz) crushed, Sugar, Eggs, Salt, Baking soda, 
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and mix well. STir  in bananas. Sift together flour, baking powder, soda, and salt, and add to  butter mixture. Fold in pineapple, andoptional ingredients. Pour into  greased and floured loaf pans to just over half full. Bake at 350 degrees  for 1 hour and 10 minutes or until done.    ***note: I use a 20 oz can of pineapple, I like the extra moisture. Also I  like to add chopped cranberries, it adds a wonderful zing.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 15 Sep 96    From:    LHartwel@ADMIN.NMT.EDU    Date:    Mon, 16 Sep 1996 13:09:00 EDT
