Saute garlic, mushrooms and scallions in oil until vegetables are limp,  about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place cashews in a blender or food processor  and grind to a coarse meal. Transfer mushroom mixture and ground cashews to  a large bowl and add potatoes, carrots, ginger, salt and pepper. Add bread  crumbs and mix well. The mixture will be soft and moist.     On a large bakin sheet or bread board, make 8 to 10 beds of sesame seeds  for patties. Using a large spoon, scoop out vegetable mixture and form 8 to  10 patties; place on sesame beds. Flip to coat both sides generously.  Gently transfer to a well-oiled vegetable grill and grill for 3 to 4  minutes on each side, until medium brown. Makes 8 to 10 patties.     Variation: Saute burgers in olive oil until golden brown.
