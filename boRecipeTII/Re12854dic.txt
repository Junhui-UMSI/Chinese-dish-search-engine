1. Put first four ingredients in a double boiler over gentle simmering  water and whisk for 5 minutes, or until the sauce is frothy and thick  enough to leave a ribbon trail. Let cool slightly.    2. Whip the heavy cream in a copper bowl or electric mixer to stiff peaks.    3. Working over a bowl of ice, fold the whipped cream into the egg mixture  and gently spoon it into serving dishes. Garnish with fresh berries. Do not  overcook the sauce or it will curdle. Refrigerate it until ready to serve.  This frothy Italian egg desert has a curious history. It is named for  Marechal Balione, who defended Florence against the Castracani in the 15th  century. Reduced to eggs and brandy (the enemy having captured the  provision wagon) the Marshals chef invented a dessert, which he called  zuppa baglioni-Baglionis soup.
