1. Mix together the shrimp, chicken, egg, and cornstarch. Heat 3       cups of the oil in wok. When it is hot, add shrimp and chicken       mixture. Cook for 1/2 minute and drain.       2. Place above mixture in pot with the broth, mushroom, water       chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and green beans. Bring to a boil. Add       salt and sherry. Return to a boil. Reduce heat and allow to       simmer.       3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil until it is hot. Add rice       and brown quickly. Drain and add to soup. Serve. By cooking the       rice before it is added to the soup, we add a crunchy texture to       this savory dish.
