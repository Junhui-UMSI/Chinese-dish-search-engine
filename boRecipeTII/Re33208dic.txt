Basic Pasta Dough - Whole Wheat
Water, Whole wheat pastry flour, olive oil, Salt, 
Put it into a mixer with bread hooks or a food processor, and knead until  really smooth. I suppose you could also do this by hand, but I havent  tried it!    Weve also substituted 1/4 of the flour with kamut, buckwheat etc. to add  extra flavor, and the recipe suggested that chopped spinach, herbs, or  tomato paste could be added.
