(3/4 stick) unsalted butter, Breadcrumbs, Black Pepper, Russet potatoes; peeled and, Cloves garlic; peeled and, Salt, Scalded milk, Egg, Sour cream, Minced chives, 
A 12-cup madeleine mold. Serves 6    In a saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold salted water. Bring to a boil,  partially cover, and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender.    Drain and mash the potatoes with a potato masher, ricer, or through a  sieve.    Combine and mix the potatoes, hot milk, 2 tablespoons of the butter, egg,  garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper.    Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet and saute the breadcrumbs  until lightly golden.    Butter a 12-cup madeleine mold. Press about 2 teaspoons breadcrumbs in each  cup. Freeze for 15 minutes.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    Pack about 3 tablespoons of the potato mixture into each madeleine cup:  melt the remaining butter and brush it over the madeleines. Place the mold  on a baking sheet and bake until puffy and lightly browned, about 25  minutes.    Nudge each madeleine out of the pan with the point of a knife. Cool on a  rack and serve with the sour cream mixed with chives and 1/2 teaspoon salt.    NOTE: Author of the book says "This is the creation of my friend Pat Opler,  a natural cook who teaches cooking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Dip the  madeleines in sour cream mixed with chives for cocktails."    Posted to recipelu-digest by ncanty@juno.com (Nadia I Canty) on Feb 26,  1998
