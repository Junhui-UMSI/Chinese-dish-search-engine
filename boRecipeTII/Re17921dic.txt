Put 1 c of the wheat bran in a small bowl. Add the boiling water, stir once  and let stand to soften.    Cream the margarine and sugar in a mixing bowl. Beat the eggs slightly and  add to the margarine mixture, mixing well.    Combine the flour soda and salt in a mixing bowl. Combine the wheat bran,  the softened bran, and the flour mixture, and then combine with the  egg/margarine/sugar mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Stir until  thoroughly mixed.    Pour into a plastic container with a tight lid. Store in the refrigerator  for a minimum of 12 hours and a maximum of 6 weeks. Makes 2 dozen.    These muffins are made, stored in the refrigerator, and baked whenever they  are wanted. About 25 minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 400  degrees F. Spoon the batter into teflon-lined or buttered muffin tins,  filling them 2/3 full. Bake 18 minutes and serve.    I like to add rasins and pecans to the muffin tins before cooking.
