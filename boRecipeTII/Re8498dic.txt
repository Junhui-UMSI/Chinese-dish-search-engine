Author notes: "This dish delivers crips, browned potatoes and creamy-soft  garlic:  the latter can be squeezed out of its skin and spread on the  potatoes.  A food processor fitted with the 3mm clicing blade makes quick  work of slicing hte potatoes, which I dont peel becuse I like the flavor  of the skins."
