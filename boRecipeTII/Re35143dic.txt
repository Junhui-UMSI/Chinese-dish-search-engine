Bechamel Sauce #1
Butter, White pepper, milk, Whipping cream, All-purpose flour, Salt, 
In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat.  Remove pan from  heat; stir in the flour.  Add the milk and cream all at once, whisking  constantly until the flour partially dissolves.  Return pan to high heat;  cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce boils and is smooth.  Reduce  heat and simmer 2 to 3 mins. or until sauce is thick enough to heavily coat  the wires of a whisk. Remove pan from heat; add the salt and white pepper.    MARIOS    TURTLE VILLAGE, DALLAS    From the <Micro Cookbook Collection of Italian Recipes>.  Downloaded from  G Internet, G Internet.
