From: Alan Kundls mom!    When I was a kid, I rated these cookies 4 star! Beats the heck out of  Reeses Peanut butter cups.    ################################## #### Peanut Blossom Cookies #### ####  from Alans Mom      #### ##################################    INGREDIENTS:  1 bag of Hersheys Chocolate Kisses    MIX all thoroughly. Dip out by Tablespoonful and roll by hand into balls.  Ball should be about the size of a hickory nut, so when you press the Kiss  into it, the sides squish up a little.    Put on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees for 8 minutes. Remove  from oven and press a chocolate kiss into the top of each cookie. (Cookie  will crack around edge when you press kiss on firmly) Bake for another 5  minutes. Should be golden, but dont burn. The Kiss will melt down only a  little bit.    Alan
