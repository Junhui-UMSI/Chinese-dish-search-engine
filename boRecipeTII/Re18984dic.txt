Angels Tip
Sweet cream, White creme de cacao, 
Pour creme de cacao in a pousse-cafe glass. Carefully float cream on top,  being careful not to let ingredients mix. (You can float the cream by  holding a teaspoon bottom-side up over the glass and pouring the cream  slowly over it.)    Float cherry on top of cream (also known as a King Alphonse when you add  the cherry).    Recipe By     : Joe Robertson
