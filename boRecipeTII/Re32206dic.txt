Put them into a large bowl and  add the vinegar and soy sauce . Marinate at room temperature 1 to 2 hours,  or covered in the refrigerator overnight, turning the ribs occasionally.    2. Preheat the oven to 350F.  Remove the ribs from the marinade and place  in an 18 by 12 inch roasting pan. Pour in the water and bake, covered,  until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.    3. Pour off and discard the cooking liquid.  Baste the ribs well with  barbecue sauce. Return the pan to the oven and bake, basting with barbecue  sauce once or twice, until well browned, about 30 minutes. Serve hot,  passing extra sauce separately.
