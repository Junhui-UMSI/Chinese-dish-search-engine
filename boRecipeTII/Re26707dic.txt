Bainbridge Butterscotch Shortbread
Salt, Unsalted butter, Dark brown sugar, Flour, Baking Powder, Finely chopped walnuts or, 
Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder together and set aside. Cream the  butter until soft and gradually add the sugar. Add the flour mixture a  little at a time and mix well. Refrigerate for one hour. Divide the dough  in half and keep one portion in the refrigerator while rolling out the  other to approximately 1/4" thickness. (The dough gets soft quickly.)  Sprinkle the dough with the nuts and gently press them in with the rolling  pin. Cut into 1-1/2" squares.   Pix uses a paper pattern as she is hopeless  at estimating things like this, unlike Faith. Prick with a fork and place  the squares on an ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat with the rest of the  dough. Bake until golden brown, approximately 15 minutes in a preheated  350F oven. Makes 6 dozen squares. This is a devostatingly rich, crumbly  cookie.
