Now, go down to your handy market and get some rolls, say Kaiser rolls  (plain) or maybe plain french rolls.  Take your freshly made Qd and pulled  pork and pile it on the botton half of the roll, then pour several, 3-4  tablespoons to taste, of the vinegar sauce and top with the slaw, maybe  nearly as much as the pork. There is something about the  vinegar/slaw-mayo/smoked pork that is unique and wonderfully good.    bbq-digest V2 #066    From the BBQ recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
