Aunt Alice Ice Box Fruit Cake
Marshmallows, Raisins, Pecans, maraschino cherries, Coconut, Butter, graham cracker, 
Crumble graham crackers. Add raisins, coconut, cherries and pecans. Mix  well.    In a double boiler melt marshmellows and butter. Pour over the dry  ingredients and mix well.    Put in pan and press down well. Place in refrigerator over night. Next day  remove from pan and wrap in foil.    Keep in refrigerator until ready to slice.    NOTES : This is an old family recipe that my younger brother and I like  since we are not over fond of regular fruitcakes. I wrote this down from  watching my aunt make it in the 50s.
