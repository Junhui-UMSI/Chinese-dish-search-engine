Defrost the petite peas. Trim the ends of (and string if necessary) the  snow peas and blanch them. (To blanch, drop into a pot of rapidly boiling  water for 30 seconds, drain and plunge into a bowl of ice water. This will  stop the cooking and set the bright green color. Drain and dry on paper  towels.)    Combine sour cream, dill, curry powder, salt and pepper in a small bowl and  mix thoroughly. Combine with the petite peas and the snow peas, mixing  together lightly so as not to mash the peas. Chill. This can be made the  day before serving and stored, covered, in the refrigerator. To serve, line  a large bowl with ruffly garden or other pretty lettuce and fill with the  salad. Serves 12 to 18 people.
