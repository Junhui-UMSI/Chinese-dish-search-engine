Egg, Vegetable oil, Baking soda, Sourdough starter, Salt, Baking Powder, Bacon, milk, All-purpose flour, Sugar, cheddar cheese, 
In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp. Reserve bacon  drippings, if desired.  Drain cooked bacon on paper towels. Crumble and set  aside.  Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners; set aside. Preheat  oven to 400~F.  In a large bowl, sitr together flour, baking powder, baking  soda, salt and sugar. Stir in cheese; set aside. In a medium bowl, beat  egg. Stir in sourdough starter, milk and oil or drippings. Add to flour  mixture.  Stir with fork until dry ingredients are just moistened. Fold in  crumbled bacon. Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 to 3/4 full with batter. Bake  in preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from  muffin cups.  Serve hot.    Great for breakfast with a glass of orange juice! These turned out  absolutely WONDERFUL.  I would suggest greasing the muffin tins very well.  The cheese tends to make them stick a little!
