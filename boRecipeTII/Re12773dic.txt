Yukkae Jang Kuk (Korean) Beef Stew
Eggs, Skirt steak, Chilli powder, Spring onions, Black Pepper, Sesame oil, Sugar, Salt, Rice Vermicelli, 
Put whole piece of steak into saucepan with salt, pepper and just enough  water to cover. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer until steak is very  tender. Allow to cool, then shred with fingers into fibres. Return to the  pot, add spring onions and sugar and simmer for 10 minutes. While  simmering, soak rice vermicelli in hot water for 10 minutes, then drain.  Add to simmering pot. Mix sesame oil and chilli powder together and add to  stew. The rich red oil will float on top. Drizzle the beaten eggs into the  bubbling stew, stirring so that it cooks in shreds. Serve with hot white  rice.    Imran C.
