This recipe comes from a beautiful cookbook called Chic Simple Cooking that  has some of the best food photography Ive ever seen.    1. Heat oil in a large soup or stock pot over medium-low heat. Add the  onion and saute until the onion is golden, about 5-10 minutes.    2. Add the remaining ingredients, raise the heat to high and bring to a  boil. Once it comes to a boil, reduce heat to low an simmer, partially  covered, for 25 minutes or until the squash is tender.    3. Puree the soup with your hand blender, ( one of my favorite tools) a  blender, or a food processor.    4. Garnish each serving with orange slices.
