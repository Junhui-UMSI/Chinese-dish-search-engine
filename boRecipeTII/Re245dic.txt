In a large sauce pan, saute the garlic and onions in olive oil over medium  heat until the onions become clear and tender. Add in the mushrooms and  continue to saute until tender. When the vegetables are tender, reduce heat  and add in the diced tomatoes and a tablespoon water. Simmer for two  minutes and add in the tomato sauce, paste and spices. Mix well with a fork  until all of the tomato paste has been absorbed. Cover and simmer 30  minutes. Remove bay leaf before using.    Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta (or tofu and yogurt) with the egg, set  aside in fridge. Preheat the oven to 375 F. Prepare the lasagna noodles as  directed and drain.    When the sauce has simmered, remove from heat and start the lasagna. First  layer 4 noodles on the bottom of a 13x9 inch baking dish, spoon 1/2 of the  ricotta mixture on top and spread evenly. Next spoon 1/2 primavera sauce  over ricotta, and spread 1/3 of mozzarella and 1/3 sharp cheddar on that.  Repeat this same layer process once. Put on one more layer of noodles and  top with remaining mozzarella and cheddar, sprinkle with ample parmesan.  Bake 45 minutes. Let cool ten minutes before serving, enjoy.
