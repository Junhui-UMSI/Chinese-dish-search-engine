They do desrve another try, so I am posting them here. I had  never made pancakes before, so there was a little problem with that, and  the bananas appeared to be *too* ripe (they were orange-ish and hard  instead of mushy...).    * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJs BBS for Homemakers!
