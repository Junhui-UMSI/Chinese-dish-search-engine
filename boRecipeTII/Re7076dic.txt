Poppy Seed Cake/bread
Flour, Self-Rising, Sugar, milk, Eggs, Vegetable oil, Poppy Seeds, Butter Flavoring, Almond extract, Vanilla extract, 
I bought the Zoji S-15 last weekend.  So far the only cake that I have made  in it is a poppy seed cake, very moist but only rose about 1/2 way up the  pan. The cake was very good.    Bake for 50 minutes.    The book"THE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK II" By Donna German (Cost 8.95), says  :  "If using the Zojirushi, place the ingredients in the machine in the  order given.  Any ingredients listed following asterisks are to be added at  the "beep".  As the machine is preprogrammed to turn off when the  cakes/quick breads are completely baked, you may ignore the baking times."    Recipe By     : news.den.mmc.com!
