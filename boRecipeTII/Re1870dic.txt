>From: srasheed@juno.com (Sam M Rasheed)    In the bowl of an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the  flour, sugar, yeast, salt, ground chili and black pepper; beat well. Mix  briefly on low speed. Increase speed to medium and add water, milk, poblano  chiles and bell pepper; beat well. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well  after each addition. Change to the dough hook, and knead for three minutes.  The dough will be very sticky. Add the butter to the dough, one piece at a  time, and continue to knead until dough is smooth and shiny and the butter  is completely incorporated, 10-20 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly  buttered bowl and flip the dough to coat it evenly with butter. Cover bowl  with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise in a warm place until it has  doubled in bulk, about three hours. Punch down the dough and turn it out  onto a lightly floured surface. With heavily floured hands knead for five  minutes. Return to a buttered bowl and flip dough to coat evenly; cover and  chill dough for at least six hour or overnight in the refrigerator. Remove  the dough from the refrigerator and shape the cold dough into two small  loaves. Place in two buttered 4x9 inch loaf pans, cover with a tea towel,  and let rise in a warm place until the dough fills the loaf pans and does  not spring back when gently pressed, about one hour. Preheat the oven to  375 degrees. Bake the loaves in the middle of the oven until they are  golden and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes. Remove loaves from  oven and turn them out onto wire racks to cool. Makes 2 loaves.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Joyce Rosenfield <dogsmom@cinci.infi.net>  on Nov 16, 1998,
