1.  Freeze fruit (but not rock hard). 2. Run frozen fruit through food  processor.  (You may need to soften it up a bit first. Let it run long  enough to whip a lot of air into the mixture, but not long enough to  completely thaw the fruit.) 3. Serve right away.    Note:  Cantaloupe, peaches or strawberries may also be used, but you will  need to use a little fruit juice to get the right consistency.         12    fruit servings    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Oct 26, 98
