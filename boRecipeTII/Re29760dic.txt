Tempeh Mock Chicken Salad
Tempeh, Soy sauce, Fresh parsley; minced, Prepared mustard, Garlic powder, Mayonnaise*, Celery stalk; finely chopped, Dill pickle; minced, Onion; minced, 
Steam tempeh for 20 minutes.  Allow to cool enough to handle. Cut into  cubes slightly smaller than 1/2 inch. Combine with remaining ingredients &  mix lightly.  Serve on a bed of lettuce or as a sandwich filling. * I use  tofu based mayonnaise, blend the tofu well with a touch of salt & pepper,  lemon juice & a crushed garlic clove.
