Tourta Me Yaourti Kai Stafides (Spicy Yogurt Cake W/ Rasin
Eggs, Baking Powder, Salt, Vanilla extract, All-Purpose Flour, Chopped walnuts, Granulated sugar, Baking soda, Ground cloves, Grated nutmeg, Sweet butter, Plain yogurt, Raisins, Ground cinnamon, 
Cream the butter and sugar together, then add the eggs, one at a time,  beating well after each addition.  Meanwhile, sift the flour with the  baking powder and salt and add gradually to the batter, beating on medium  speed.  Combine the yogurt with the baking soda and add to the batter, a  few tablespoons at a time, along with the vanilla.    Mix together the raisins, spices, and if desired, the walnuts.  Pour half  the batter into a buttered 9-inch-square pan and sprinkle half the raisin  mixture evenly over it.  Pour in the rest of the batter and top with the  raisin mixture.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees F) for 40 to 45  minutes, or until cake springs back to the touch of your finger.  Remove to  a cake rack and cool in the pan.  Cut into squares or diamond shapes when  cool.    Note: Cupcakes are more popular than cake squares in the larger Greek  cities.  This recipe would make a dozen cupcakes.    * Source: The Food of Greece, by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles * Typed for you  by Karen Mintzias    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
