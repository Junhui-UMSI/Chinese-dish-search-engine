In a Dutch oven or large pot, saute garlic, onion and chopped jalapeno in  olive oil until onion is soft. Add chicken broth, Rotel tomatoes and  chiles, chopped or shredded chicken, water, wine, oregano and red chile  powder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.    While broth simmers, bake tortilla strips on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees  for about 7 minutes, or until crisp, but not brown. Remove strips from  cookie sheet when done and set aside to cool. After soup has simmered 20  minutes, skim off 1/3 cup broth into a glass measuring cup, add the 2 Tbsp.  flour to the measuring cup of broth, stir until smooth and return the  broth/flour mixture to the soup. Bring the soup back to a boil then turn  heat back to low after it boils.    To serve: place tortilla strips in the bottom of two soup bowls, cover  strips with soup mixture, and garnish with your choice of cilantro leaves,  fresh serrano pepper, shredded cheese and sour cream. Makes two generous  servings. Can be doubled.    Note to Chile-Heads: You can certainly up the quantities of jalapeno,  serrano and red chile powder. If I could get the HOT Rotel mixture here in  Michigan, I would have used it. Enjoy!    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Dorothy Sheets <dsheets@ameritech.net> on  Oct 07, 1998,
