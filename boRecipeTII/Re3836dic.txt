Sinterklass is coming to town...Only the town happens to be Amsterdam and  he is more Saint than jolly old elf. When Sinterklass arrives in the  Netherlands on December 6th, he is always accompanied by Pete. Pete is a  marvelous character whose antics rival Sinterklass for the love and  affection of the crowds gathered to welcome them on their journey from  Spain.    While Sinterklass greets the crowd with his Saintly manor, Pete is know to  hand out tasty nuggets called Pepernoten to the children anxiously waiting  to great them and ring in the Holiday Season. Start your own tradition from  The Netherlands this year and hand out these spicy little cookies to each  guest as they arrive at your door.    Makes 5-Dozen Small Cookies    In a large bowl sift flour and baking soda together with all the spices.  Add remaining ingredients and combine until mixture forms a dough. With  floured hands, form the dough into about 60 1/2-inch balls and place on  greased cookie sheets. Bake in a pre-heated 350-F degree oven for 15-20  minutes, or until the cookies are light brown. Store in an airtight  container.
