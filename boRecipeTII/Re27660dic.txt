This is a 10-gallon recipe; cut ingredients in half for 5 gallons. Steep  grains in a mesh bag until water reaches boiling. Remove grains.  Follow  standard  extract  brewing process, adding extract and Cascade  hops.  I  boiled  the wort in an 8-gallon pot and added 4 gallons of  cold  water.  Pitch  yeast at about 80 degrees. I fermented this in a  20-gallon  open  container for 4 days, then racked to glass carboys for 24 days. This is a  pale ale recipe I used for my class. I used M&F pale  extract and grains  were for demonstration more than flavor. I suggest  doubling grain  quantities if you want to get something out of them.
