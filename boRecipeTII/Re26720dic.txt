Ive posted the Bajan Beans and Rice recipe that I adapted from a recipe of  Gabe Mirkins before. This is one of my most favorite recipes and when I  was making it today I found out halfway through that I didnt have any  canned white beans. I forgot that I had bought some dried white beans  intending to cook them up myself. No problem I had two cans of black beans  and so decided to try the recipe with them. I liked it just as much and it  made the dish even more colorful. The canned black beans I had werent  quite as mushy as the white beans I have used before -- the final product  was less soupy. For those who may have missed the recipe, here it is again,  this time with black beans:    Heat 3 cups of water and mix in bouillon. Set aside. Note: any broth may be  used, I just happen to like Better Than Bouillon especially. Saute garlic,  onion, and red, green, and habanero peppers in 1/2 cup of broth in large  pot for 10 minutes. Add remaining broth, tomatoes, and rice and simmer  covered for 15 minutes. Add zucchini and simmer for an additional 30  minutes. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking. Add black beans, corn,  and cilantro and cook an additional 5 minutes to heat through.    Freezes well.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #302 by Michelle Dick <artemis@rahul.net> on  Dec 21, 97
