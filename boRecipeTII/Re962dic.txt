Indianaston Baked Beans (Synthesis)
Dry navy beans, Onion; roughly chopped, Smoked belly of pork, Maple syrup, Molasses, Dry mustard, Ground ginger, Salt, Black pepper, Hot water, 
Soak beans overnight in a saucepan. In the morning, add more water if  necessary to cover, and parboil beans for 10 minutes. Then run cold water  through beans in a colander or strainer. Cut pork jowl in one-inch cubes,  leaving skin on. The quantity of the pork may be decreased if desired  without affecting flavour.    Put the chopped onions with half of the cubed pork on the bottom of the  bean pot (a traditional stoneware 2-3 quart pot is perfect). Put beans in  pot and cover with the rest of the pork. Mix other ingredients with hot  water and pour over the beans. Add enough water to make level with the  beans. Bake in a 300 F. oven for 6 hours, adding water from time to time if  necessary to prevent the beans from drying out.
