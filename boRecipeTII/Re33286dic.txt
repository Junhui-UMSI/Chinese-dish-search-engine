From: jills@vnet.IBM.com    Date: 18 Feb 1994 05:18:12 -0500  In answer to the recent request for scones, I dug some up from: Hamlyn All  Colour Cakes and Baking cookbook.  It is an honest-to-goodness British  cookbook.    Fruit scones are my favorite, so Ill write the recipe for them first.  Because this is a British cookbook, the measurements may look a little  different than youre used to.  In these recipes, I assume that caster  sugar is roughly equivalent to the American granulated sugar. Finally, we  have Basic Scones.    Preheat oven to 425 F.  Sift the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and  salt into a bowl.  Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine  breadcrumbs.  Stir in the sugar and enough milk to mix to a soft dough.    Turn onto a floured surface, knead lightly and roll out to a 3/4-inch  thickness.  Cut into 2-inch rounds and place on a floured baking sheet.  Brush with milk to glaze.    Bake for 10 minutes then cool on a wire rack.  Serve with butter or cream,  and jam.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
