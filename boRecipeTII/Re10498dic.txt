Quick Fudge
Vanilla, milk, To 1/2 cup cocoa, depending, Salt, Butter or margarine, 
My mom has been making fudge for years from a recipe  she found on the side of a box of Dominos Powdered  Sugar. The last time I found Dominos sugar, they  werent putting this recipe on the side of the box any  more, so Ill go ahead and post it. Warning: its  fattening, very rich, but you can make it in less than  a half hour and without all the beating and stirring  that fudge normally takes.    QUICK FUDGE    Melt butter in bottom of large saucepan. Stir in  confectioners sugar, followed by all other  ingredients. Keep stirring until mixture comes to a  full boil. Pour mixture into an 8-inch square buttered  pan. Let cool, cut into small squares.
