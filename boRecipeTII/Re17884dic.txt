Aloo Palak (Spinach and Potato Curry)
Turmeric powder, potatoes, Garlic, fresh spinach, Tomatoes, Onion, fresh ginger root, Cumin seeds, Red chilli powder, 
Recipe adapted from Sameen Rushdies `Indian Cookery Serves 6 as part of a  mixed meal, maybe 3-4 on its own with rice/naan and a pickle. This works  well with either fresh or frozen spinach. I have made it with kale as well;  10oz (275g) weighed without stalks.    1. Scrub potatoes and boil them in their skins until almost, but not quite,  done. Leave to cool, then cut into small cubes.    2. Meanwhile, if using fresh spinach or kale, remove the coarse stalks then  rinse and cook gently for 10 minutes, in just the water clinging to the  leaves in a covered pan. Cool and chop (reserve any remaining liquid). For  frozen spinach, just defrost and chop.    3. Chop the onion finely, crush or finely chop the garlic and finely chop  the tomatoes (keep them all separate). Measure the spices out into a little  bowl.    4. Now brown the onion in a little vegetable stock or water until golden  brown - about 10 minutes perhaps, topping up with hot water as necessary.  Let it stick slightly from time to time to get that fried smell.    5. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and stir for a moment. Add the  spices, and a little more water if necessary. Cook for a few minutes, then  add the tomato. Cook gently 3-5 minutes.    6. Add the potatoes and spinach, mix well then cover and simmer gently  until ready, stirring once or twice to prevent sticking. Its done whenever  the potatoes are cooked to your liking and the spices have permeated the  vegetables.
