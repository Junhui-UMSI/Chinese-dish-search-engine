Lemon Butter Sauce
Virgin olive oil, Garlic, Shallots, White wine, Lemon rind, Lemon juice, Heavy cream, unsalted butter, 
In small saute pan over high heat combine and simmer olive oil, garlic  shallot, white wine, lemon rind and lemon juice.   Reduce to about 2  tablespoons, add cream and reduce again to 1/4 cup. (This happens very  quickly, so do not leave the pan.) Reduce heat to medium and whisk in  butter, 1 piece at a time, until all butter is melted and sauce is thick.    This will take no longer than 1 minute. Strain sauce; this sauce must be  kept warm until serving time or it will separate. Do so in a thermos or  over a pan of hot water for up to 2 hours before serving.
