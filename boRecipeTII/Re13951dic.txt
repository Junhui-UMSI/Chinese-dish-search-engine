Wine-Habanero Sauce
White onion; chopped, or, Salt, Distilled white vinegar, Apple; peeled, Lemon juice, Garlic, Lemon juice, Habaneros, Chipotle in adobo sauce, White wine, Ground cumin, Ones, 
Stem and seed the habaneros, leaving the inner membranes.  Combine the  habaneros with all the other ingredients except the lemon juice and  wine in a blender and process to a fine puree. Transfer to a  nonreactive pan and cook over low-medium heat for ten minutes. Add  lemon juice and wine, mix well and transfer to sterilized sauce  bottles. Keep refrigerated, shake well before use.    I found that this sauce improves over time, apparently as the wine  turns into vinegar.
