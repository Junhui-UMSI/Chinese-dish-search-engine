"Every time that I make this cheesy dish, I get requests for the recipe. It  puts a different spin on spaghetti and is great for any meal. The  leftovers, if there are any, also freeze well for a quick meal later on in  the week."  -- Ruth Koberma, Brecksville, Ohio    In a large skillet, saute onion and green pepper in butter until tender.  Add tomatoes, mushrooms, olives and oregano.  Add ground beef if desired.  Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Place half of the spaghetti in a  greased 13-inch x 9-inch x 2-inch baking dish. Top with half of the  vegetable mixture.  Sprinkle with 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Repeat layers.    Mix the soup and water until smooth; pour over casserole. Sprinkle with  Parmesan cheese.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, or  until heated throughout.    From "Taste of Home" magazine, Collectors Edition.    Typed for you by Iris Grayson
