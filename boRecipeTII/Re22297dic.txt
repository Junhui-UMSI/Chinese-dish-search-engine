Wipe turkey well with a damp cloth, inside and out. Remove any pinfeathers,  and singe off hairs. Simmer the giblets in 1 1/2 c water for 20 to 30  minutes. Remove from cooking water, and chop. Save the cooking water. Mix  the dressing ingredients together thoroughly, and stuff both neck and body  cavities of the bird. Wrap remaining stuffing in aluminum foil. Skewer the  openings shut, truss, and place the turkey breast down on a poultry rack in  a large roasting pan. Place the foil-wrapped stuffing in the bottom of the  pan. Rub the bird generously with about 1/4 cup of the softened butter.  Roast the turkey, uncovered, in a moderately slow oven, 325 degrees,  basting every 20 minutes with a mixture of the oyster liquid,  giblet-cooking water, and remaining butter, melted. After 1 1/2 hours or  roasting, turn the turkey breast side up. Allow about 30 minutes per pound  for roasting the turkey. The turkey is done when the leg joint moves  easily. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
