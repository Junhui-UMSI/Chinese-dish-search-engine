Chile Rellenos Casserole
Fire roasted anaheim chiles;, Sharp cheddar cheese; cut in, Eggs, milk, Flour; (or more, make a, Salt, 
Open the chiles, which have been de-seeded, and put in cheese, can also add  white onion slivers also at the same time, if desired. Lay the chiles in a  casserole dish which will hold them(buttered of course) and cover with this  mixture: in a blender add the eggs and the milk and salt, blend for a few  seconds and then add the flour to make a batter,pour this over the stuffed  chiles, or chiles rellenos which means just that! Bake about half an hour  or longer until a toothpick comes out clean, in a 350F  oven,uncovered....let stand to set for about ten minutes and then serve  with my previous Mexican rice!! This is truly an unforgetable dish, which  will make the A list.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Aug  14, 1998,
