Xnipec Salsa (mayan For "dogs Breath")
Juice of 4 Limes, red Onion, Habanero peppers, Tomato, 
This Salsa Recipe is from the cookbook "Hot Spots" by Dave DeWitt, editor  of Chile Pepper Magazine.    This salsa is simple to make and is in constant demand from friends and  relatives. Friends with allergies swear that it clears out their sinuses.    Soak the diced onion in the lime juice for at least 30 minutes. Add the  other ingredients and mix, salt to taste and add a little water if desired.    Yield 1 1/2 cups Heat Scale: Extremely Hot!    Thats it! What could be easier? Actually its a good starting point. I use  more habs, dont remove the seeds, use 2 tomatoes (paste types) and either  chop it up smaller in the blender or a food processor.
