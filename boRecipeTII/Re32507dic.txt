Sweet Curried Pumpkin Soup
sweet potatoes, Garlic, pumpkin, Curry powder, olive oil, Paprika, Garam masala, onion, 
Saute the vegetables in the olive oil, add the spices and saute a little  longer. Add water and cook till the vegetables are soft. Puree.    Since my husband is British I went a little easy on the curry powder, he  doesnt have the strong Hungarian tastebuds that I do.
