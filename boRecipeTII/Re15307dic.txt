From: "The Gordons" <gordonk@nbnet.nb.ca>    Date: Mon, 6 May 1996 08:33:47 -0300  Soak beans overnight or use quick soak method (bring beans and water to  cover by 1" to a boil for 5 min. Turn off heat and cover. Let sit 1 hour,  then proceed). Pour off soaking water and cover beans with fresh water and  bring to full boil. Lower heat and simmer. While beans simmer, in a large  soup kettle or dutch oven, saute onions using your favorite ff method (I  use a little stock), when translucent, add cumin, chili pd, poultry  seasoning, green chiles and salsa verde. Saute for 5 minutes, adding a  little stock if it begins to stick. Then add the rest of the stock, bay  leaves, tomatillos and 3/4 c cilantro. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered  while beans continue to cook. When beans are just tender (1-2 hours) add  them to the soup pot and simmer everything together for another 1/2 hour.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, add the rest of  the cilantro and the lime juice, stir to blend. Ladle into big bowls and  top with green onions and an optional dollop of ff sour cream.    Posted by MAYFLIES@aol.com to the Fatfree Digest [Volume 16 Issue 27] Mar.  31, 1995.
