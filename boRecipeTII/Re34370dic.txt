Bake at 350 until bubbling  gently (about 1/2 hour). Stir in the sherry, and serve. Do not cook longer,  otherwise the textures will be lost.    Salsa Cruda: Coarsely chop equal parts tomatoes, white onions, peppers  (yellow/red bells plus jalapenos/serranos/habaneros - adjust amount  depending on the heat level desired). Pack with juice of two limes per pint  of pack and salt to taste. Pressure can for storage, or simmer gently for  about 10 min and refrigerate. Simmering can be omitted if a crunchy salsa  is desired.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #81    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
