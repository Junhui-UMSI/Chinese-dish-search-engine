Preheat oven to 350 F.  Spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray.    Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl.  Combine remaining ingredients and  add to dry mixture.  Mix until all ingredients are moistened.    Press mixture into a rectangular shape 7 inches wide and nine inches long.  (Wet hands or use one hand and a damp spoon.)    Bake about 12 minutes.  Remove from oven and cut into 16 bars using a sharp  knife.  Separate bars slightly and return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes more.  The browner the bottom of the bars, the crisper they will be when cool.    The edges will crumble slightly when cut - set aside for a snack.
