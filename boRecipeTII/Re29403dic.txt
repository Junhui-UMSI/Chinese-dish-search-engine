I want to share a really yummy recipe I adapted from Laxmis Vegetarian  Kitchen by Laxmi Hiremath. ( It was practically fatfree to begin with.) I  left out the jalapenos and salt for my family but tried them with heat for  myself...theyre good either way!    Preheat oven to 400 degrees Combine kofta ingredients and mix thoroughly,  form into 1 inch balls and bake 1 inch apart non-stick baking sheet until  golden, about 30 min. Meanwhile, blend together 1st 5 gravy ingredients in  a blender with 1 cup water. In sauce pan on med-high put mustard seeds and  heat until they start to pop, then add blended ingredients. cook 5 min and  add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer for 10 min. Cool koftas for 5 min.  Pour gravy into a serving dish, add koftas and serve hot.    I served this with a basmati rice green pea pilaf and a vegie curry. It was  so yummy, my family scarffed them up before anything else!
