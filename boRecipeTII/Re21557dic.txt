Apple Potato Salad
Celery stalks, Potatoes, new, small, Dill (optional), Dressing, No-Oil, Apple, Delicious, 
Slice the potatoes into bitesize pieces and boil until tender, but not  soft.  Peel the apple and slice into bitesize pieces (sprinkle with lemon  juice until ready to use). Chop the celery finely. Cool the potatoes by  draining and placing in pan of ice water. Combine all ingredients and mix  with dressing and dill if desired. I used Medford Farms (tm) Creamy Dill  No-Oil Dressing. Chill several hours. Quick and delicious.    From the recipe file of Val Rowe MM 6/12/93
