Portugal- Piri-Piri Sauce
olive oil, Bay leaf, lemon rind, Chilli peppers, 
Pour the oil into a small, screw-top jar and add the chilli peppers, bay  leaf and lemon rind.  Screw on the top and shake. Leave to stand in a warm  place for at least 24 hours before use. It will keep at room temperature  indefinitely.    Ready made piri-piri can be bought by the portuguese, who use it a good  deal as a spicy condiment on pasta, fish or meat and also to flavour stews.
