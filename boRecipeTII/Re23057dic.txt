Truffes Pralinees (Praline Truffles)
Butter, Egg yolks, Praline paste, water, chocolate, 
Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil, remove from  the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then replace on a low  fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop beating. Remove from  the fire and add the butter and the praline paste. Let cool, beating from  time to time (this cooling takes a rather long time). When the mixture  begins to solidify, take some with a spoon, place it in some grated  chocolate (prepared in advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These  truffles keep a week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable  shortening for the butter.    Source   : The Art of French Cooking Posted by: Rina de Jong
