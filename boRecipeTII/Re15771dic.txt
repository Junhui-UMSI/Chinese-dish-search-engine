Sharp cheddar cheese is recommended.    Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" to 11 oclock. Select "white bread" and push Start.    In hot, humid weather, use 1/8 c less water; also in very cold weather.    Tested in DAK 1-1/2 lb R2D2 bread machine.  Sylvias comment: a hearty,  easy-to-slice bread, surprisingly good for sandwiches. I even used powdered  buttermilk when I ran out of powdered milk with good results.
