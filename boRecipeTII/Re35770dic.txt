I like to stuff Cornish hens, roast them and serve them with a simply white  wine, chicken stock reduction. This is, as usual, off the top of my head  with approximate quantities.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (yes, 450!). Saute pancetta, shallots and  mushrooms in olive oil until the mushrooms are almost done, then add the  garlic and rosemary and continue to cook until the mushrooms are done. Add  1/4 white wine and season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and let  cool until you can handle it.    Stuff hens with mushroom mixture, truss and rub the hens with olive oil and  butter until well coated. Season the hens entirely with salt and freshly  ground black pepper.    Place the hens in a pan that can go in the oven and stovetop that is not  much larger than hens (a 10-11 inch frying pan with a metal handle is  ideal) and roast at 450 until they are done (45-55 minutes but keep an eye  on them). Remove hens from pan and tent with foil. Remove most of the clear  fat from the pan, making sure the caramelized bits and dark liquid stay in  the pan. Place pan on medium high heat and once the liquid begins to  bubble, deglaze with 1/2 cup white wine. Add chicken stock and reduce by  1/2 over high heat. If there are any undissolved bits, strain your sauce.    Serve one hen per person, spooning sauce overtop. Avoid serving this with  anything that would soak up the sauce (like mashed potatoes) as there isnt  much sauce and you will want it with the bird.    This is nice with roasted potatoes and perhaps some green beans with  butter.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Romain Saha <rsaha@CCMAIL.AIT.CA> on Sep 9,  1997
