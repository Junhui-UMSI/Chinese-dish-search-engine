Eyeballs on Ritz
Eggs; hard boiled, Black olives, Ritz crackers, Red food coloring, 
Cut hard boiled eggs in half lengthwise.  Remove yolks and make filling for  deviled eggs.  Cut out small hole from bottom center of each egg (about  5/8" diameter.) Poke a black olive partway through each hole and hold in  place by filling eggs with yolk filling.  Place each egg, olive side up, on  a Ritz cracker.  Paint red lines, resembling blood veins, with a toothpick  on the eye.    Note: next time try this with small eggs and small olives to see how it  works.  I used large of each and the eggs were larger than the Ritz but  they still looked good.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Jeanne Geake <jgeake@burgoyne.com> on Oct  16, 1998
