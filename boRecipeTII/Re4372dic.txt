Persimmon Pulp
See below, 
As a followup to the requests of a few weeks ago, here are some  persimmon recipes that my mother sent. I can swear that the pudding  is good, especially when served hot with whipped cream or just cream  poured over it. We use the wild persimmons and just run them through  a food mill after removing the stems in order to get the pulp. I  assume you can do much the same thing with the larger, store-bought  variety. One additional note of interest, its said that the  persimmon seeds can be used to predict the weather. Cut a seed in  half and look at the tiny plantlet (or whatever its called) inside.  If it looks like a spoon, the winter will be very snowy. A knife  shape indicates a cold and windy winter, and a fork means that the  winter will be mild.
