Alive with enzymes, this super drink combines high-energy and protein.  Great for weight-gain programs, too. You can cut some calories and carbs by  ommitting the dates.    Whir everything in a blender at high speed for about 30 seconds.    Per shake: 513 calories; 12 g protein, 17 g fat, 78 g carbohydrate    Nuts to you: Raw nuts (or seeds) and raw nut butters, available in  health-food stores, are an excellent way to get a spectrum of vitamins,  minerals, protein and the hard-to-get essential fatty acids in their  natural state. If that precious oil forms at the top of the nut butter,  dont pour it off. Stir it back in with a butter knife. Keep refrigerated.
