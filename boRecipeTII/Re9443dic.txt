Thought Id get back to you and share some more recipes! The ones Im going  to share this week are from a cookbook put out by the Mormons who use these  recipes to cook in their temples. I bought this when I was a Mormon and I  still love them after I resigned!    In large mixing bowl, combine first 5 ingreds. Set aside. In medium bowl,  combine eggs, pumpkin and oil. Add liquid ingreds. to dry ingreds., stir  just until moistened. Stir in apples. Spoon batter into greased or  paper-lined muffin cups, filling 3/4 full. Sprinkle streusel topping over  batter. Bake in preheated 350 F. oven for 35-40 mins. or until toothpick  comes out clean.    ANY MUFFIN STREUSEL TOPPING    combine flour, sugar, cinnamon. Cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over  muffins before baking.  Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest by "William & Evelyn Hall"  <wchall@nevia.net> on Mar 30, 1998
