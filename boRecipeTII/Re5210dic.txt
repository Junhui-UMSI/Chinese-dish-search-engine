Pilav (Steamed Sauted Rice)
Butter, Chicken stock, Salt, SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5, Black pepper, Butter, Rice, white, 
In a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan, melt the 2 tablespoons of butter over  moderate heat.  when the foam begins to subside, add the rice and stir for  2 or 3 minutes until all the grains are evenly coated. Do not let the rice  brown.  Pour in the stock, add the salt and a few grindings of pepper, and  bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to  its lowest point.  Simmer for 20 minutes, or until all the liquid has been  absorbed and the rice is tender but still slightly resistant to the bite.    Pour in the 4 tablespoons of melted butter and toss the rice with a fork  until the grains glisten.  Drape a towel over the rice and let it stand at  room temperature for about 20 minutes before serving.    91 of 116    Source: Time Life Series: Middle Eastern Cooking "circa 69"    MMed by: earl.cravens@salata.com Beach, CA * 310-543-0439 28.8k (1:102/125)  ?
