Barbequed Chicken
Crushed thyme, Salt, White vinegar, MSG, Dried ground lemon peel, Cracked black pepper, Dry mustard, Coarse grind garlic powder, Celery salt, Split fryer chicken, 
I let the chicken stand in the fridge for a good hour before cooking on the  Weber with a combination of charcoal and hickory (plain tap water in the  drip pan.) I personally thought it was a tad bit on the salty side, but the  family said it was fine. Must have been me. Next time I might back off some  on the plain salt and the garlic powder and make up the difference with  Lawrys (Coarse Ground with Parsley) Garlic Salt, which I happen to like a  lot.    NOTES : The weather finally warmed up around here (Eastern Nebraska) long  enough to allow for barbequing some chicken this past Saturday. I let a  split fryer sit in white vinegar for twenty minutes or so, turning a few  times. Next I coated the halves with olive oil. Then I sprinkled on this  rub (makes plenty for one split fryer):  Recipe by: Craig Edmundson    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 04, 1998
