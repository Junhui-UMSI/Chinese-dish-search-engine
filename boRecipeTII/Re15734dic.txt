Add the mascarpone, beating well and then the heavy cream. Put in  the refrigerator.    Soaking: Mix the coffee, sugar and liqueurs together until sugar is  dissolved. Pour half of the mascarpone mixture into a large bowl. Dip 1  ladyfinger at a time into the coffee mixture until thoroughly moistened but  not dripping. If you allow the ladyfingers to absorb too much of the coffee  mixture, they will exude their liquid into the cream layer and the cream  will be watery. Cover the entire surface of the cream layer with the dipped  ladyfingers. Pour the remaining mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers,  smoothing with a spatula. Chop some bittersweet chocolate into medium/small  chunks and sprinkle over the top of the dessert. Refrigerate for at least 8  hours, overnight is best. Serve cold. This is a truly decandent dessert    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #137    From the MasterCook recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
