Cajun Grilled Swordfish
swordfish steaks, CAJUN SEASONING, Onion powder, Black pepper, White pepper, Salt, Thyme, Annatto powder, Hungarian paprika, Sage, Rosemary, Ancho pasilla cayenne chile, 
Put ingredients in mortor and grind. A spice grinder makes the rub too  fine. Store excess in tightly-sealed jar.    Thaw the swordfish steaks and sprinkle Cajun seasoning generously on both  sides. Place the steaks on a small grill over a glass baking dish so that  the liquid that comes out of the fish does not wash away the seasoning.  Marinate for 1-2 hours at room temperature.    Grill the steaks over hot coals with some mesquite chips for flavor. DO NOT  OVER COOK. Remove the steaks when the meat at the center of the steak has  just turned white, about 140F. Check for doneness with two forks and open  up a section of the steak to see into the center.    Serve with dirty Cajun Rice.
