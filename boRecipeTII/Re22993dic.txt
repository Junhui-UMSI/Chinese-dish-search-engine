Trout Amandine with Creole Meuniere Sauce
Chopped parsley, Bay Leaves, Gulf speckled trout fillets, almonds, Flour, Butter, Worcestershire Sauce, butter, Green Onions, milk, olive oil, Lemons, 
* Note: See the "Emerils Essence Information" recipe which is included in  this collection.    Season the fillets with Emerils Essence. Place the fillets in a glass bowl  and cover with the milk. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator.  Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and drain.  Season the flour with Essence. Dredge the fillets in the seasoned flour,  coating the fillets completely.    In a large saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil  together. When the oil is hot, pan-fry the fillets for 3 to 4 minutes on  each side or until the fillets are golden. Remove the fillets from the pan  and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fillets with Essence. Set the  fish aside.    Pour the oil from the skillet, leaving the browned bits in the pan. Stir in  the Worcestershire sauce, lemons and bay leaves. Bring the liquid up to a  simmer and simmer the liquid until it reduces by 2/3, about 4 minutes.  Remove the lemon pith. Whisk the cold butter cubes into the sauce, a cube  at a time, until all the butter is incorporated. The sauce should be thick  and coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the almond slices.    To serve, place one fillet in the center of each plate. Spoon the sauce  over the fish and garnish with parsley and green onions.
