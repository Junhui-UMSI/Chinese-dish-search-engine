Twice-Baked Cheesy Potatoes
Sour cream, Baking potatoes, green onion, Butter, cheese, 
This isnt a dinner but we make it ahead of time and serve it to our  friends.  Its from a Better Homes and Gardens Make Now Serve Later  cookbook.    Scrub potatoes, poke with a fork and bake at 425 for 40 - 60 minutes, till  done.  Cut a lengthwise slice from the top of each potato.  Scoop out the  inside of each without breaking the skin and set the skin aside.    Mash the potato, add butter and beat in the sour cream.  Season with salt  and pepper. Stir in cheese and onion.  Spoon the mashed potato mixture into  potato shells.  (It always looks so plain that I take a fork and scratch  vertical and horizontal lines into the top.)    Refrigerate for 2 to 24 hours or wrap in moisture-proof wrap, seal and  freeze.  Bake uncovered at 425 for 35 minutes, or bake frozen potatoes for  1 hour.  Sprinkle with paprika, and (my favorite) bacon bits.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 29 October 96    Date:    Wed, 30 Oct 1996 00:16:51 EST    From:    John A Morrow <morrowj@JUNO.COM>
