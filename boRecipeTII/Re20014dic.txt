<excerpt>http://www.sugarplums.com/ezine/parents.html    Partially thaw the strawberries and lemonade. Combine the strawberries,  lemonade, water and ice cubes in a blender and blend until smooth. Freeze  overnight. About 2 hours before the party, remove mixture from freezer and  let stand at room temperature until its slushy. (Time Saver Tip: At  Sugarplums, weve made this in our gelato machine and it works fine.) Add  club soda, blend and serve. Spray a little whipped cream as a garnish,  place a cherry on top or set a piece of colorful fruit on the side of the  cup, and serve. Heres a novel way to serve a kids drink ... yours from  Sugarplums. Take a clear plastic glass (a study one is preferable). Cut up  an orange into slices, about 1/4 inch thick. Grab a jar of marachino  cherries or another colorful fruit. Set the glass in front of you and drop  a cherry into the glass, pour in a small amount of 7-up or sparkling water,  carefully position a slice of orange on top so that it forms a "seal," then  pour the slush on top of the orange slice. Its a layered drink that the  kids can enjoy in parts. Theyll think its RAD! Recipe source unknown    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 15, 1998
