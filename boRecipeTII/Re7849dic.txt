Turkeys appeared on Portuguese tables as early as the 16th century,  introduced by explorers, so Portuguese turkey stuffings have a long  history.    Fry the onion gently in the butter, chop the giblets small add to the  onions and cook gently until tender.  Combine the mashed potatoes  with the eggs, olives and parsley, then add the giblet mixture and  seasonings.    From "Raw Materials" by Meryl Constance, Sydney Morning Herald,  12/15/92.
