SERVES 7      I know that this sounds like Im pushing it, but one of my former cooks,  Scott, came running over with this recipe and told me I had to try it. I  think he developed it when he came home one night and found little in the  pantry except apple butter. What do you think could have caused him to come  up with such a recipe? Interesting that he always has soy, sherry, and  fresh ginger on hand. It is really quite good.      Place the steak on a plate. Mix the remaining ingredients together and  rub 2 tablespoons onto the steak, both sides. Allow to marinate for 1/2  hour and then broil on an oven rack to your liking. I enjoy mine a bit  rare. Turn once. Slice the steak across the grain of the meat and place the  pieces in an oven-proof dish. Pour the remaining sauce on top of the meat  and place under the broiler for just a few moments, thus allowing it to  glaze a bit.      This is delicious served with Rice with Cheese and Onions (see recipe).    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
