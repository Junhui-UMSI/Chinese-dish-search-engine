awootten@polaris.cv.nrao.edu (Al Wootten)    The Brides of Black Hole Chili team entered their chili in the 1978  Luckenbach Ladies World Championship Chili Cookoff, where it garnered sixth  place.  The recipe had evolved from the first attempts at the Marble Falls  Chili Cookoff some years before, where it was concocted by Flash Bruhweiler  and Sonny Day.                                     The Recipe    This is a lot, and can feed 50-75 people if sufficiently hot chili is  prepared.  Combine the oil, garlic and meat and cook till brown.  If you  didnt realize that the meat must be in 1 cm cubes, start cutting.  Start  deseeding the japone peppers(the seeds are too hot) and boil in a few  quarts of water until they are soft, then scrape the inside pulp out. Add  to meat mixture when the meat begins to brown, reserving the chili water.  Add pequin chiles to chili. Now add 2.5 cups water or beer, plus 1.5 cups  of the water you boiled the peppers in, and simmer slowly in the pot for 80  minutes while you win moseyin and egg toss contests, and just generally  fall down a lot. Now let your chili settle and the grease rise so that you  can skim discard it (the grease, not the meat). Dispense with all remaining  sobriety.                          ADDITION OF SPICES CEREMONY    Gather the team and groupies together for this ceremony. This is the point  to go all out for showmanship, so ham it up. Hopefully you have ground the  following spices freshly, so that laborious grinding processes do not sap  the climax of its power.                                  THE SPICES    8 tablespoons ground cominos (cumin) -- group chants praises of cumin    6 tablespoons ground oregano -- praise the oregano somewhat more loudly    4 tablespoons ground coriander -- some of the women may swoon    1.5 teaspoons cayenne pepper from a flask labelled paprika    1 tablespoon salt (add half this at first, increment as necessary    1 tablespoon tabasco -- accompanied by loud chants and holy rollin    8 tablespoons or more paprika, from a container prominently labelled  cayenne     pepper -- accompanied by a crescendo of frenzied shouting and counting     of tablespoons. If your team can still count high enough, add 24     teaspoons instead.    4 oz tomato paste after the hubbub has died down and no judges are looking.     Remember, real men do not put vegetables in their chili.    1 tsp exotic spice could be added here, too. At Luckenbach, the Brides of     Black Hole added mint and epizote. No one knew, or knows yet, what     epizote is. The more obscure the spice, the better.    0.5 tbl masa harina -- or less, to thicken the chili if it is too thin.  This   must be added last. Cook 10 more minutes    Open up a beer and dish up a bowl o red.    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
