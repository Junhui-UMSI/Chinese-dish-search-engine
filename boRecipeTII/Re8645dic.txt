Carrots, Sage, Onion, Water, Lemon juice (optional-- I, salt and pepper, Bay leaf (I use 1/2, Stalk celery, Clove garlic (optional), Peels from 6-7 large, Tabasco (optional-- I leave, 
These are very good basic stocks. The garlic broth is particularly good by  itself on cold days when you have a slight head cold in need of clearing  :-) Except for oil, which I omitted, this recipe is directly from the book.    First scrub the potatoes very throroughly and cut away any blemishes, then  peel them into thick strips at least 1/4 inch thick. Use peeled potatoes in  another recipe. Peel the onion and quarter it, Wash carrots and celery and  slice.    Combine all ingedients but Tabasco sauce and lemon juice in a large stock  pot and simmer for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until the veggies are really  soft. Add water as needed to the pot to keep the veggies covered with  liquid. There should be about 6 cups of broth when done, so add water  sparingly. The broth will be done when it tastes just right :-) simmer it a  little longer if it seems weak, or add a little water if it seems strong.    For a clear broth, strain out all the veggies with a sieve, and adjust  seasonings as needed. For a thin puree, fish out the celery, garlic, and  bay leaf, then press everything through a sieve until a dry pulp is left (I  cheat and run it through the food processor). Lastly, add a dash of Tabasco  and/or lemon juice, if desired.    Garlic Broth <T>    Make the Potato Peel Broth above, adding an entire head of garlic in place  of the single clove. Break up the head of garlic and mash the cloves just a  little (no need to peel it). This is better as a clear broth, IMHO. The  recipe calls for 11/2 T olive oil, but I never miss it.
