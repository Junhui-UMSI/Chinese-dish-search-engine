It is rich in the basic simple flavors of  the ingredients, which is a nice contrast to the spicy foods we have at  other meals. We think of it as comfort food.    We buy kasha in a box at  the grocery store. The brand is Middle East or  something similar. Kasha is buckwheat groats. Groats are the whole grain,  usually crushed.    Cook these three items simultaneously, so they are all ready to serve at  about the same time.     To prepare pasta: Cook according to package directions. Drain.     To prepare kasha: Put one egg white in small bowl.  Stir in dry kasha  grains and mix until well coated.  Put kasha In non-stick pan over medium  heat.  Cook and stir kasha until dry.  Add hot liquid. Stir, cover and  reduce heat. Cook until kasha is tender and liquid is absorbed. Set aside  and keep warm.     To prepare mushrooms: In separate oiled skillet over medium heat, saute  onions briefly.  Add mushrooms, cover and cook until tender.  Stir  occasionally. Remove from heat and keep warm.     To serve: These can be combined or served separately on the plate.  Dress  with yogurt. Serves 2.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #78    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
