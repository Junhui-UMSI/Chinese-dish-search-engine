Arrange the slices in a shallow dish. Combine the  vinegar, water and salt, stirring well to dissolve the salt, and pour over  the eggplant slices.  Let stand for one hour, then remove the eggplant  slices from the solution and pat dry with paper toweling. Heat oil in a wok  to a depth of two inches until very hot (375 F). Deep-fry the eggplant  slices, a few at a time, until light brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and  drain on paper toweling. To make the sauce, combine all of the ingredients  in a saucepan, bring to a gentle boil and simmer, stirring frequently,  until the sauce thickens slightly.
