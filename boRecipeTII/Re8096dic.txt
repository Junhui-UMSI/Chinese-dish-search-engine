Potato Burgers
Water, Whole wheat flour, To 1 raw onion grated, Potatoes grated, 
Mix all ingredients in a bowl.  Using a non-stick pan on medium heat, or a  griddle at 325 degrees, ladle the mixture on pan and mash down until flat  about burger thickness. Cook for 8-10 minutes. Turn over and cook 5-8  minutes.    Hints: Use a food processor to grate the potato and onion. The onion may  get gooy but thats o.k. Ore Ida has hash browns that are already grated,  and Ive been meaning to try that as a time saver but havent done it yet.  If any one has done this please post your success. If you want to double  this recipe, use separate bowls or it is too hard to mix, Ive already  tried. These freeze well. I usually think of one potato as a serving. For  two people the above recipe could be dinner and lunch. Top with all your  favorite low fat condiments. It surprised us at how much these taste like  Real hamburgers with all the toppings.
