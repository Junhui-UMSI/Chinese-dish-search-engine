West Indian Bread Pudding
Skim milk, banana, Honey, French bread cubes, Fat-free egg substitute, Plus, Golden raisins, Ground nutmeg, Vanilla extract, 
A request was made for a non fat/low fat bread pudding. I found this recipe  in Secrets of Fat-Free Baking by Sandra Woodruff, RD. I have not tried it,  yet.    Combine the bread cubes and raisins. In a separate bowl, combine the  remaining ingredients, and pour over the bread cubes. Stir gently to mix,  and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes.    Coat a 1-1/2 quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the  bread mixture evenly in the dish, and bake at 350 degrees F for 50 to 60  minutes, or until a sharp knife inserted in the center comes out clean.    Let stand for 10 minutes. Serve warm, and refrigerate any leftovers.
