Thai Beef and Noodle Stir Fry
Galangal, Fish sauce, Japanese noodles, Onion, Fresh lime juice, Lean ground beef, Ground red pepper, Garlic, Fresh basil, Fresh green beans, 
My friend Lisa made this up and its great.  You can substitute ground  turkey, or rinse the ground beef, or certainly use much less meat.  Also  you may want to experiment with the fish sauce and lime juice amounts, this  is a very strong flavored dish and can be very salty depending on your fish  sauce. Also we like it best with regular noodles, smallish flat ones.    Put a large pot of water on to boil for the noodles.  Brown the ground beef  in a wok and strain off the fat.  Turn off the heat for now.  When the  water boils, add the noodles. Return the beef in the wok to high heat. Add  the garlic and toss continuously until the garlic becomes translucent  (about 2 minutes). Add all the remaining ingredients except the basil, and  continue tossing as the mixture cooks. When the noodles are done, dump them  into a colander to drain. Add the basil to the meat mixture, toss a few  times, and then add the noodles. Toss thoroughly and serve.

Or use ginger.  The fresh basil is very    important.
