In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, scallions, garlic, herbs, and spices.  Add flour and baking powder and mix together so that all ingredients are  well blended and have the consistency of a thick batter (about as thick as  pancake batter).    In a large heavy skillet, heat enough olive oil for frying. Taking a  heaping tablespoon at a time, drop batter into hot oil and fry until golden  brown and crisp.    Remove at once with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve hot.    Yield: about 3 dozen    NOTE: In other islands, spinach or horta (greens) are often used instead  of tomatoes.  Follow instructions above, using 1-1/2 cups boiled,  well-drained, chopped spinach, or any other greens.    Source: The Food and Wine of Greece - by Diane Kochilas  :       ISBN: 0-312-05088-7
