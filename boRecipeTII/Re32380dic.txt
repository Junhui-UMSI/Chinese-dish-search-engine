Barley Soup with Ham
Ground allspice, Vegetable oil, Onion, Fresh mushrooms, Garlic, Imported bay leaf, Pearl barley, celery, Chicken broth, Carrots, Unsalted butter, Fresh parsley leaves, smoked ham, Lemon juice, 
Put the oil and onion in a soup kettle, set over low heat, and cook until  the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Raise heat to medium, stir in the  garlic and carrots, and stir-cook for one minute. Add the celery and  stir-cok for a minute.  Add the barley, broth, bay leaf, and allspice.  Bring to the boil, skimming the top of the soup as necessary. Simmer,  covered, for about one hour, or until the barley is tender. (The soup may  be prepared in advance to this point.)    Stir the ham into the piping hot soup and let simmer while you prepare the  mushrooms.  Heat the butter in a small skillet, add the mushrooms and lemon  juice, and stir-cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the parsley. Add the  mushroom mixture to the soup and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Discard the  bay leaf.  Season the soup with salt and freshly- ground pepper to taste.  Ladle into warmed bowls and serve immediately.    Makes 5 servings.    [WASHINGTON POST  Jan 11, 1989] Posted by Fred Peters.
