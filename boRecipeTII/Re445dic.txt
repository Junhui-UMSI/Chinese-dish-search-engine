Lemon Marmalade
Fresh lemons, Water, Sugar, 
Wash and slice lemons to the size you wish to have in the finished  marmalade. Carefully remove all seeds and seedlets to prevent the marmalade  from having a bitter taste. Measure fruit and juice and add 3 times the  amount of water. Soak for 12 hours. Simmer for about 20 minutes (be careful  not to boil). Let stand again for 12 hours. For every cup of fruit and  juice, add 3/4 cup sugar. Cook these ingredients in small quantities (about  4 to 6 cups at a time), until they form a jelly when tested (about 220  degrees to 222 degrees). For yellow color, do not boil. Can or seal with  paraffin.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #461 by fundwell@excel.net on Dec 19,  1997
