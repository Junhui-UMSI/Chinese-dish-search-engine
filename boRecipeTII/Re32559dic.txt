This is remarkably similar to the Moroccan Salted Lemon recipe that  Im looking for, except that it uses sugar instead of salt. Adapted  from Julie Sahnis "Classic Indian Cooking."    Wash the lemons in cold water and dry thoroughly.    Quarter 6 of the lemons from the top almost all the way through to the  bottom, leaving about 1/2 inch so theyll hold together.  Squeeze the  juice from the other lemons.    Mix the salt, cumin and black pepper in a small dish, and mix  thoroughly with the lemons, Stuff the lemons into a quart jar and  pour in the lemon juice.    Cover with cheesecloth to prevent dirt from getting in the jar, and  let sit in the open for about 1 week.    On the 7th day, pour the juices from the jar into an enamel or  stainless steel pan, add the sugar and cook over low heat, stirring,  until the sugar dissolves.  Add the lemons and cook, stirring gently,  for 8 minutes or so. Stir in the raisins and peppers.  Put the lemons  in a sterilized jar and seal with the lid.  Let sit for a week or so  before eating. Use like you would any pickle, as an accompaniment.    San Francisco Chronicle, 10/12/88.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; November 1 1992.
