Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit; grease baking sheet.    Mix together all ingredients thoroughly. Allow to stand approximately 10  minutes until liquid has been absorbed.    Spread into 8-10 patties or squares on baking sheet. These do not spread so  they can be placed closely together (about 1/2" apart). Bake about 20  minutes or until slightly crisp. Remove from oven; move to cooling racks to  cool thoroughly.    Makes approximately 8-10 patties. Posted to EAT-L Digest 31 Mar 97 by Joan  Mathew <cmathew@IADFW.NET> on Apr 1, 1997
