Ras El Hanout (Morroccan Spice)
***  NON   NE *****, 
This renowned traditional Moroccan blend of 20 or more spices never fails  to intrigue foreigners. Ras el hanout means "head of the shop". presumably  because the owner mixes the blend to his own taste and to the requirements,  including spending power, of the customer. The blends vary from one region  to another: those from the bazaar in Fez seem to be the most complex. All  contain some aphrodisiacs- cantharides (the shiny green Spanish fly  beetle), ash berries and monks pepper- as well as spices and dried  flowers. Ras el hanout is always sold whole and ground as required. It is  considered warming, and is used with game; in rice and couscous stuffings;  in lamb tagines (stews), such as Mrouziya; and in a sweetmeat of almonds,  honey, butter and hashish called el majoun.    A typical blend could include cardamom, mace, galangal, long pepper,  cubebs, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, rose buds, lavender  flowers, Spanish fly beetle, ash berries, grains of paradise, black pepper,  chufa nuts, turneric, cassia, nigella, monks pepper, belladonna and orris  root.
