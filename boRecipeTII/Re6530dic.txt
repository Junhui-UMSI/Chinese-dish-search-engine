To prepare peaches: Drop peaches into large bowl of boiling water &  let stand 2-4 minutes to loosen skins. The riper they are, the less  time this will take.  Drain & carefully remove skins. Set peaches  aside. Combine water & sugar in large saucepan & bring to boil over  high heat. Once sugar has dissolved, reduce heat & simmer a few  minutes. Add peaches to syrup & continue to simmer gently until fruit  is tender but not soft, about 15 minutes. Again, time will depend on  ripeness. Remove from heat & cool peaches in syrup.    To prepare sauce: Scald milk with 1 bay leaf & set aside. Combine  sugar & egg yolks in med bowl & beat with whisk or electric beater  until mixture becomes pale yellow & forms a ribbon. Add hot milk  gradually, beating constantly, then pour mixture into nonaluminum  saucepan. Add remaining bay leaf & cook 15-20 minutes over low heat,  stirring constantly, until sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. Do  not let sauce come to boil. As soon as sauce is thick enough, remove  it from heat. Stir briefly, then stir in vanilla. Place piece of  waxed paper directly on surface to prevent skin from forming as sauce  cools. If sauce gets lumpy, strain it. To serve, pour pool of sauce  on each plate. Drain peaches (the syrup can be poured over other  fruit or used to flavor drinks). Set peaches on sauce. Garnish each  peach with fresh bay leaf.    Peaches:    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
