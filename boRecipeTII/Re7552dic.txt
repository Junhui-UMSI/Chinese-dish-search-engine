Place  roast, rib side down, on a cutting surface.  On the meaty side, cut a 3  1/2" long and 1" deep pocket above each rib, making 6 pockets total. Spoon  stuffing into pockets.  Place roast, rib side down, in a shallow roasting  pan. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Insert a meat thermometer into  the thickest part of the roast, making sure the bulb doesnt touch the  bone. Roast in a 325 oven for 1 1/2 to 2 1/4 hours or til thermometer  registers 160. Cover loosely with foil after 1 hour to prevent  overbrowning.  For easier carving, let roast stand, covered, for 15  minutes.  If available, use fennel bulb tops to line serving platter. To  serve, slice roast between ribs. Serves 6.    EAT-L Digest 11 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
