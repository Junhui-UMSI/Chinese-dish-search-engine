Whole Spinach Greens
Fresh spinach (after, Ginger powder, Tsps. crushed fennel seeds, 
2 2-3    whole dried red chilies 2 2-3 sm fresh green chilies      1/3 ts asafetida (if you have it)    I love Indian recipes for greens but they usually take so long to cook that  I only make them on special occasions.  Recently I found one for spinach  thats quick and good and salt-free.  As always, adjust the seasonings to  taste.  {Taken from Shahnaz Mehtas _Good Cooking From India_.)    Thoroughly wash spinach, trimming off only the ends of the stems.  Do not  chop.  Drain.  In a dry iron pan, stir crushed fennel seeds and ginger  powder over moderate heat until the powders become slightly brown (about 2  minutes).  Remove from heat and set aside.  In a large skillet or wok heat  2-3 TBSPS of your favorite liquid for sauteing.  Sprinkle the asafetida,  then add the chiles, then the spinach, then the fennel and ginger.  Stir  fry 1-2 minutes.  Cover and simmer 2-4 minutes, then uncover and stir until  the spinach is ready.  Do not over cook.
