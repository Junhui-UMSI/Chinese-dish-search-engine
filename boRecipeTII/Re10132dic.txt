Lightly spray a large nonstick skillet with nonstick spray and set over  medium heat. Lay 1 tortilla in the skillet. Arrange half the cheese evenly  over the tortilla, covering it completely. Scatter half the chiles and half  the onions over the cheese. Top with a second tortilla. Spray the upper  tortilla lightly with the nonstick spray. Weight the quesadilla with a  plate and cook 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom tortilla is crisp and  lightly browned. Remove the plate and turn quesadilla with a long spatula.  Weight it again and cook it another 2 minutes or until the cheese is  melted. Slide onto cutting board and cut into 4 to 6 wedges. Transfer to  plate and serve immediately. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Keep a bowl  of Pico de Gallo close at hand.    Note:  Leftover grilled chicken or shrimp are also good sprinkled over  cheese!
