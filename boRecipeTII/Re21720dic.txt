Apple Twists
Ice water (up to 5), Tart apples, 1/2.    shortening, PASTRY, Cinnamon, Salt, Butter, APPLES, Plain flour, Warm water, Sugar, 
Make pastry using above ingredients, roll thin & cut into 8 strips. *I use  Pillsbury premade pie crusts as a time saver.    Peel & core apples, cut into 8 pieces. Wrap a strip of pastry around each  apple slice. Arrange apple twists in baking pan, leaving space between each  twists. Brush twists w/melted butter. Sprinkle w/mixture of sugar and  cinnamon. Pour water over twists and bake for 25-30 min. at 350 degrees.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Gaye Stanton <chatter@USIT.NET> on Sep 8, 1997
