Baked Stuffed Sweet Potatoes
Walnuts, Brown sugar, Apple, Cranberries, Sweet potato, butter, Juice and Zest of 1/2 Orange, 
Preheat the oven to 400F. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, place the cranberries  in water to cover, bring to a boil, and cook until the berries pop open,  about 5 minutes; set aside. Place the sweet potatoes or yams in a  baking  pan and bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until tender when pierced  with a knife. Let cool, cut a slash in the top surface of the sweet potato,  and scoop out the pulp; set aside, reserving the shells. Reduce the oven  temperature to 325F. In a large bowl, combine the sweet potato pulp,  cranberries, orange juice, apple, and walnuts. Add the butter and brown  sugar. Place the mixture in the reserved shells and return them to the  oven. Bake until heated through, about 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with  grated orange zest and serve.
