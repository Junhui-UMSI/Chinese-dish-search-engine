Lay out all ingredients on a large work surface such as kitchen table. Heat  a skillet on high.  While you are assembling a quesadilla, have one  browning at the same time. Remember to brown both sides.    Assembly:  Place ingredients in the order listed above on top of one  tortilla.  Cover with another tortilla and press down with open palm to  flatten.    Cutting:  The easiest way to do this is with a clean pair of sharp  scissors. All them to cool down enough to handle and cut into 4 triangles.  These are great for parties and you can make them ahead and reheat in the  oven.    JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #004    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
