Separate the kidneys with a sharp knife, discarding all gristly  portions and fat.  Sprinkle with salt. Cover with claret, add bay leaves,  sliced onion, pepper. Let it marinate 2 hours.       Pound the steak with flour, and cut into 1" pieces. Brown suet or heat  bacon drippings in iron skillet. Then add diced onion and cook until clear;  remove onion from skillet.       Over medium heat, brown steak well.  Next drain the kidneys, reserving  the marinade; dredge with flour, and brown, stirring carefully. Add 1 pt or  less or hot water, stir well, add chopped celery and parsley, and marjoram.       Mix all well, and transfer to the casserole from which you intend to  serve the pie.  Strain into it the marinade. Cover with a tight lid, and  bake at 325F for about 1 hour.       Remove from oven.  Brown the mushrooms in bacon drippings, and if they  need thickening, thicken with flour mixed in cold water and stirred  carefully to avoid lumps. Add the mushrooms to the casserole mixture. Cover  with a crust of puff-paste, pie crust, or biscuit dough, and return to  400F oven, and bake until brown, about 20 to 30 minutes. Serve at once.    Source:  The First Ladies Cookbook - 1969 .
