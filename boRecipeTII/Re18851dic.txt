Andouille Stuffed Jalapenos
olive oil, Garlic, Salt and pepper, Beer; (up to 1), Salt and pepper, Oil for frying, Flour, Cream cheese, Finely chopped onions, Egg yolks, Baking Powder, Bulk andouille; finely, Chopped parsley, Fresh jalapenos, Essence, 
Preheat the fryer. In a saute pan, heat olive oil over medium heat and  render the andouille for 2 minutes. Add the onions and saute for 1 minute.  Remove from the heat and cool. In a mixing bowl, mix the garlic, parsley,  and cream cheese together. Mix well. Stir in the cooled andouille mixture.  Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper. Using a sharp knife, split  the jalapenos, starting at the tip, in half, leaving the stem intact.  Remove the seeds from the pepper. Stuff 1 heaping tablespoon of the filling  in the center of each pepper. Press the pepper together, sealing the cheese  mixture completely inside. Season 1 cup of flour with Essence. In a mixing  bowl, whisk the yolks and 3/4 cup of the beer. Season the mixture with salt  and pepper. Whisk in enough flour to form a batter. If the batter is too  thick add the remaining beer to thin the batter. Dredge the stuffed peppers  in the seasoned flour. Dip the jalapenos in the batter, letting the excess  drip off and coating the peppers completely. Gently lay the jalapenos in  the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the  jalapenos from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the peppers  with Essence. Yield: 16 stuffed peppers    NOTES : Posted by Emily Griffin - emgriffi@ix.netcom.com S: 4    Recipe by: EMERIL LIVE SHOW #EMIA72 PORK FAT RULES    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #919 by Emily Griffin  <emgriffi@ix.netcom.com> on Nov 22, 1997
