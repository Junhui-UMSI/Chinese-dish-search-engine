Vegetable oil, White cornmeal, Sugar, Salt, Baking Powder, Onion, Water, Unsalted butter, 
Eating Southern Style - Terry Thompson HPBooks    In a deep-sided 12-inch skillet, heat 2 inches of oil to 350?F or until a  1-inch bread cube turns golden brown in 65 seconds. While oil is heating,  combine cornmeal, sugar, salt, baking powder, and onion in a medium bowl.  Combine water and butter in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high  heat; pour over dry ingredients and stir rapidly to blend. Set mixture  aside until cool enough to handle. Form into about 24 equal balls. Drop  hush puppies into hot oil, being careful not to crowd pan; deep-fry,  turning once, until golden brown on both sides (3 to 4 minutes). Take care  to maintain correct oil temperature. Remove hush puppies from oil with a  slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve hot. Makes about 24 hush  puppies.
