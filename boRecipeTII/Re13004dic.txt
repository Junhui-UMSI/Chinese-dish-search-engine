Boil the potatoes for 5-7 minutes in salted water. Cook until tender, then  remove with a strainer.    Wash well and then chop the greens, removing tough stems. Cook the greens  until done in the potato water. Cook the tougher greens longer.    Warm the olive oil in a wide pan and add the chilies. When oil is hot, add  potatoes, stir well and cook for 1 min. or so. Add greens, tomatoes,  garlic. Continue cooking for 5 minutes or so, breaking up the potatoes and  working everything together. It becomes somewhat muddled, but delicious.  Taste for salt, add pepper and some cheese, and serve with a bit of  extra-virgin olive oil threaded over the top.    Notes: For veggies use: mustard greens, kale, collards, etc.    Formatted & Busted by RecipeLu <recipelu@recipelu.com>  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 226 by RecipeLu  <recipelu@geocities.com> on Nov 09, 1997
