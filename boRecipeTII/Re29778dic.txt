Tempting Toenail Truffles
Semisweet chocolate, Pretzel nuggets, Beer nuts, 
Recipe by: Creepy Cuisine, Lucy Munroe       Carefully remove the thin sugar shells from the beer nuts and set  aside.  Heat 2 inches of water to simmering, not boiling, in the bottom of  a double boiler. Place the chocolate in the smaller pot and set it over the  simmering water. Stir until the chocolate melts. When the chocolate is  melted, remove the small pan from the heat. Carefully insert a toothpick  into each pretzel nugget, then dip the nugget into the melted chocolate. Be  sure your pretzel (toe) is completely covered. Place 1 sugar shell  (toenail) on the end of each toe. Place on waxed paper to cool and repeat  with as many toes as you desire. Makes 4 to 6 feet.    Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).  Posted to EAT-L Digest 04 Sep 96    Date:    Thu, 5 Sep 1996 10:22:36 -0500    From:    LD Goss <ldgoss@METRONET.COM>
