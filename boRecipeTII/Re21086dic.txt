Two Bean Salad with Feta and Sunflower Seeds
slab bacon, feta cheese, Green beans, Salt, garlic, Fresh Lemon Juice, sunflower, Olive Oil, Red kidney beans, Black Pepper, Lemon Rind, 
Bring a large pot of water with salt to a boil and cook the green beans  until just tender. Drain the green beans and plunge into a bowl of ice  water to cool. Drain thoroughly.    In a large bowl whisk together the lemon juice, garlic, lemon rind, salt  and pepper. Add the olive oil gradually in a stream whisking constantly  until well combined. Just before serving, add the green beans and kidney  beans. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a decorative  serving dish and sprinkle with the feta cheese, crispy bacon pieces and  sunflower seeds.    Note: The acid from the lemon will quickly discolor the green beans,  therefore this dish should be assembled at the last minute before service  and served immediately. The salad will keep for 2 to 3 days in the  refrigerator and will taste fine although the green beans will be  discolored.
