Balsamico Chicken with Olives
Recipe Fricasseed Chicken, Pitted green olives; drained, Chopped fresh parsley, Low-sodium chicken broth, Balsamic vinegar, Tomato paste, 
DEFROST THE FRICASSEED CHICKEN, if frozen. Arrange the chicken pieces in an  oven-proof casserole or Dutch oven. Combine the tomato paste, broth and  vinegar in a small bowl, and add to the chicken. Add the olives, cover and  place in the oven. Turn the oven on to 375F and bake for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, place the fricassee sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat,  and cook until it is thick enough to coat a wooden spoon, about 5-to-10  minutes. Uncover the casserole and strain the sauce over the chicken.  Continue to bake, uncovered, another 5 minutes. To serve, arrange the  chicken and sauce in a serving bowl or on a deep serving platter, and  sprinkle with the parsley.
