Egg Roll Skins
Flour, Salt, Eggs, Water, Vegetable oil, 
Combine flour, salt and eggs. Stir in water a little at a time until a  smooth, thin batter.  Heat 1 ts salad oil in 7 inch skillet over medium  heat.  Pour in 1/4 cup batter.  Rotate skillet until batter covers bottom,  then let it cook until surface is set; do not turn. When set, carefully  slide it onto paper toweling. If wrapper sticks, roll one edge of it over  and loosen bottom with a spatula.  Wipe any particles from bottom of  skillet. Repeat until all batter is used up letting each wrapper cool on  its own piece of paper toweling.    Fill with favorite egg roll filling and refrigerate uncovered for 1 hour.  Fry in 1" of oil in skillet at 375 degrees two at a time until well browned  on both sides.  Drain on paper toweling. Can be eaten at once, or frozen  for later use.
