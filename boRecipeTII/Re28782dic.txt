Thai Beef Salad (Yum Nua)
Juice of two limes, fresh coriander, Fish sauce, Light soy sauce, fresh basil, Filet beef, lettuce, 
Fry or roast the fillet to 1 below your preferred degree of doneness. While  thats happening, process most of the herbs, the lime juice and the fish  and soy sauces together. Leave some of the herbs for use as a garnish.    When the meat is cooked, slice it thinly. Put the herb mix in the pan and  heat through. Add the sliced meat, and simmer or a few minutes. Laty the  meat on the salad, and spoon the sauce over it. Sprinkle the remaining  herbs and some sliced chillies on top.    Great with jasmine rice, not bad with couscous or bread.
