Head chef Gerry Shoenig sent the recipe; it also is prepared by sous chef  John Clemens.    Mix flour with melted butter in saucepan. Cook until bubbly over medium  heat about 30 seconds. Blend in hot milk and bring to boil, stirring well.  Remove from heat; set aside.    Meanwhile, saute scallops in lemon juice in shallow saute pan over medium  heat 5 minutes. Add green onions and mushrooms, and saute 1 minute. Add  wine and cream and cook until reduced to thick consistency, about 2 to 5  minutes. Add cheeses, pepper, salt, garlic, and milk mixture. Simmer 1  minute.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees.    Place potatoes in pastry tube fitted with wide tip. Decoratively pipe  potatoes around outsides of two 6-inch, oven-proof baking dishes. Bake in  preheated oven 10 minutes or until potatoes are golden. Remove from oven,  immediately spoon hot scallop mixture into center of potatoes and serve.  Makes 2 servings.
