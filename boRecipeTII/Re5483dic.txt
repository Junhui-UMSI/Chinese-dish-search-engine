Barbara Wassers Kosher Passover Kitchen (Adapted from unknown source for  Passover Food Sale, Cong. Agudat Achim 1980) Our family eliminated the  sugar from the original recipe, but if you like things sweeter, you could  add 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar.    9 X 13 deep pan, greased with 1/2 stick margarine 350o F. oven    1. Pour hot water over farfel, and drain immediately.    2. Beat eggs, vanilla, 11/2 sticks of margarine (melted), pineapple, dried  fruit if desired, and cinnamon.    3. Add matzo farfel and mix well.    4. Pour into prepared pan.    5. Bake in a 350o F. oven for 45 to 60 minutes.    6. Remove from oven and allow to set for a few minutes before cutting.    This recipe was first used in 1980 when we were not as concerned about fat  and cholesterol.    LOW FAT SUSTITUTIONS:    To reduce the fat and cholesterol, substitute the following:    1. Egg Substitute for the eggs    2. Spray the pan with vegetable spray instead of melted margarine    3. Use 1/2 stick of margarine in the recipe instead of two sticks and 1 cup  of apple juice    This makes an excellent stuffing for a veal breast.
