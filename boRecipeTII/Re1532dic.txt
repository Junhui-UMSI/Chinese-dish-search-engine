Separate broccoli into flowerets and stems; slice stems into 1/4" pieces.    Steam broccoli for 4 to 6 minutes, or until it is crisp-tender. Meanwhile,  in a small skillet, cook garlic with red pepper flakes in margarine and  spray, stirring, over moderate heat, until it is golden, add the peanuts,  the lime juice, and salt to taste, cook the mixture, stiring for 1 minutes.

[54 cals, 2g fat]    PatsNotes: * Steam the broccoli with a small piece of lime peel, zest only.    * Optional: a little fresh gingerroot, minced, and cooked with the garlic.    * I cant believe its not butter spray or olive oil spray.    The original had lots of butter.
