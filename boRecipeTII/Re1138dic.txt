*I use pecans rather than walnuts since I think pecans and cranberries are  a better pair. I have also used regular cream cheese without adverse  effects.    Dough: Using an electric mixer, beat butter and cheese in a large bowluntil  light. Add sugar; beat until fluffy. Mix in flour and salt. Gather dough  into a ball and gently knead until smooth. Divide dought into 8 equal  pieces. Gather each into a ball; flatten into disks. Wrap in plastic and  chill 1 hour. Can be made 1 day ahead. Let soften slightly before rolling.    Filling: Mix 3/4 cup sugar, cranberries, walnuts, butter, cinnamon and  allspice in a small bowl to blend. Set aside.    Position rack in the center of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.    Assembly: Place 1 dough disk on a floured work surface (keep remaining  disks refrigerated). Roll out dough into an 8 inch round. Spread 3 tbsp of  the filling over the round, leaving 1/2 inch border. Cut round into 8  wedges. Starting at the wide end of each wedge, roll up tightly and  completely to the tip. Place the rugelach, tip pointing down, on an  ungreased baking sheet and form into cresents. Repeat with remaining dough.  Brush with egg and sprinkle additional sugar atop.    Can be made ahead and store in an airtight containiner at room temperature  u to 1 week or freeze up to 1 month.
