All American Dessert
(8 serving size) or 2 pkgs, Boiling water, Tub (8 oz) cool whip, Sliced strawberries, (8 serving size) or 2 pkgs, Cold water, 
Stir 2 cups boiling water into each flavor of gelatin in separate bowls 2  minutes or until completely dissolved. Stir 1 cup cold water into each  bowl. Pour into separate 13" x 9" pans. Refrigerate at least 3 hours or  until firm. Cut into 1/2" cubes.    Layer gelatin cubes, whipping topping, cake and strawberries in 3 quart  serving bowl as pictured. (they have the blue jello on the bottom, then  cool whip, then pound cake cubes, then strawberries, then cool whip, then  red jello on top) Refrigerate at least 1 hour or until ready to serve.  Store leftover dessert in refrigerator.  note* jello sugar free gelatin, entenmanns fat free golden loaf cake and  cool whip lite can be substituted in this recipe.    my notes* Im sure any pound cake and any brand of gelatin (obviously) will  work.
