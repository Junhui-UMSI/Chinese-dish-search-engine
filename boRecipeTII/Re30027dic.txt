Many Asian countries have a balchao type preserve. It is used either in the  preparation of other dishes  ;- see Balchao de peixe (fish balchao) and  Balchao de porco (pork balchao), or served as an accompaniment to other  dishes.    For a fresh balchao, i.e. one you are not going to bottle :-    Grind together the cummin, peppercorns and chillies with the vinegar. Mix  in the turmeric. Fry the onions in the oil until all the water have gone.  Add the prawns, masala, curry leaves, garlic, ginger and green chillies.  Simmer for 10 minutes or so.
