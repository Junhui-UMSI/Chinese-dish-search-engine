Winnie Laster is known for her apples. She has an apple orchard just up the  road from her house in Joppa, Maryland, and has tried so many types of  recipes for an apple this-or-that she cant keep count. Once while trying  out a new recipe for chicken braised with apples and yams, Winnie went  outside to hang some laundry. Somehow the backdoor slammed shut and she  couldnt get back in. So Winnie hot-footed it over to her sisters who  lives about two miles up river and collected a spare key, but by the time  she got back home her braised chicken was "more like very-stewed, and the  apples and yams sort of dissolved." Disappointed but undaunted, she tasted  the homogenous mixture and thought it just grand! A little chicken stock,  some thyme from her garden, a touch of maple syrup, and a soup was born.  Its now a staple for her fall kitchen repertoire. The yams and apples make  a fine Eastern Shore duo in this thick and creamy soup, with the maple  syrup adding just a hint of sweetness.    In a pot, melt the butter. saute the onion 3 to 4 minutes. Add the yams,  apples, stock, thyme, and maple syrup. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and  simmer, uncovered, until the yams and apples are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.    In a blender or a food processor, pur?e the mixture. Return to the pot and  reheat. Season with salt and pepper.    Serve in soup bowls. Garnish with whipped cream dusted with a bit of  nutmeg.    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Mar 02, 1998
