The Ultimate Rice Pudding
Rice, Butter, Sugar, Vanilla, milk, 
Combine milk, sugar, rice and butter in a sauce pan and simmer until thick  about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Serves 4, or  2 rice pudding freaks. You can use only half the amount of sugar and  substitute Half-and-half for the milk. In case a rice pudding binge leads  you to dieting, try the recipe with 1/4 cup of sugar or granulated sugar  substitute and skim milk or skim evaporated milk. It is still super. It  makes the best rice pudding for the least effort of any weve tried. You  may also try sprinkling 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg over the top when serving.
