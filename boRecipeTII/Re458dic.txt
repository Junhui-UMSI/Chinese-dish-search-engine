Lemon Mousse
Eggs, Castor Sugar, Lemon juice, Rind Of 1 Lemon, Cold water, Heavy Cream, Angelica, Powdered Gelatine, 
Beat egg yolks with a rotary or electric beater until thick and pale.  Gradually beat in castor sugar, then lemon juice and rind. Cook slowly in  the top of a double boiler (or in a heatproof bowl placed in a pan of hot  but not boiling water), whisking continuously until mixture thickens.  Remove from heat and whisk for two minutes more.    Sprinkle the  gelatine over cold water in a cup. Place cup in hot water and  stir until gelatine dissolves. Combine with lemon mixture.    Whisk egg whites until firm enough to hold a peak and, in another bowl,  whip cream until thick but not stiff.    Reserve a little cream for decoration. Fold remainder into lemon mixture  gently.    Fold in egg whites and pour into a glass serving dish. Chill. Place  remaining cream, stiffly whipped, in a nylon forcing bag fitted with a  large star nozzle, and pipe round rim of dish. Decorate wilt a few small,  diamond-shaped pieces of angelica.  Recipe By     : Old Magazine clipping from England, Sixties?
