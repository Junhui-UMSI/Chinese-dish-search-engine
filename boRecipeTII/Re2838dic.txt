Peanut Butter Cup Cookies
Vegetable oil, Egg, Peanut butter, Baking soda, Brown sugar, Vanilla extract, All-purpose flour, 
Preheat oven to 350 F.    Cream together the peanut butter and vegetable oil in a bowl.  Add brown  sugar, vanilla, and egg.  Beat well.    Add flour (reserve 1/4 - 1/2 cup) and baking soda.  Blend thoroughly. Add  enough extra flour so that you can shape dough into balls, slightly larger  than 1-inch.  Press a Peanut Butter Cup into each ball, covering the cup  completely, and place on an ungreased baking sheet.    Flatten with a fork, bake about 10 - 15 minutes or until lightly browned.

I had a recipe  from someone at work, but I accidentally left it there. So I found another  recipe and adapted it. Theyre yummy!!" - Lisa    From: Lisa Date: 11-10-96 (10:06) The Polka Dot Cottage, a BBS with a taste  of home. 1-973-822-3627    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #713 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  97
