Preheat oven to 375 F.  Line cookie sheets with waxed paper.    In a double boiler melt the unsweetened chocolate and the first batch of  chocolate chips.  Stir frequently with wooden spoon or wire whisk until  creamy and smooth.    Pour melted chocolate into a large bowl.  Add butter and beat with electric  mixer at medium speed until thoroughly combined. Add the sugar, eggs and  vanilla. Beat on medium speed until well blended. Scrape down sides of  bowl.    Add the flour, baking soda and the three types of chocolate chips. Mix at  low speed just until combined. Chips should be distributed equally  throughout the dough.    Roll a heaping tablespoon of dough into a ball, about 1 1/2 inches in  diameter.  Place dough balls onto paper-lined pans, 2 inches apart. With  the palm of your hand, flatten each ball to 1/2 inch thickness.    Bake for 10-12 minutes.  Transfer cookies with a spatula to a cool, flat  surface.    Recipe By     :
