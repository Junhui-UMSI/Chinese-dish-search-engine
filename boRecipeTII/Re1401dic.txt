Source:A Book Of Middle Eastern Food Author:Claudia Roden    EGGPLANT PREP:Cut the stem end just below the hull, which may be removed.  Keep the slices to use as corks.    Scoop out the pulp taking care not to break the skin & sprinkle the inside  with salt. Leave them inverted in a colander for 1/2 hour to allow the  bitter juices to drain away. Rinse & stuff.    STUFFING:In a bowl, knead together the meat, rice, tomato,parsley & spices.  Stuff the eggplants 3/4 full to allow room for the rice to expand. Close  them with the reserved "corks".    COOK: Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Arrange the eggplants close  together & add enough water to come halfway up them.Season with salt &  pepper & squeeze a whole lemon over them.    Cover & cook over gentle heat 3/4 to 1 hour, adding more water if needed.  By the end of cooking, the water should be almost completely absorbed.    I often prepare stuffed vegetables. I like to use small zucchinnis, small  green peppers & even a small onion or tomato. I usually bale them in the  oven, but the eggplant calls for cooking on top of the stove. You could  probably adapt the recipe for baking in the oven if you pack them tightly  in the pan & cover them up. You would also have to baste them with the  cooking juices to keep them moist, and use cooked rice instead of raw.
