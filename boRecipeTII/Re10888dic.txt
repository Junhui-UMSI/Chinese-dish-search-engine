Extra large eggs, Nutmeg, White pepper, Kosher salt, Flour, 
Whisk together two extra large eggs, 1/2 oz kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon  nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper add 1/2 lb. flour to egg mixture and  whisk well.    Ratio of five to one washed but unpeeled potatoes to onions (five pounds  potatoes to one pound peeled and trimmed onions) shred potatoes and onions  in a food processor and dump into a colander. Drain well by pushing with  spoon or wrapping in cloth and squeezing (my preference).    Immediately add drained potato-onion mixture to the egg-flour mixture.    Use a #8 ice cream scoop to scoop about 8oz of mixture into a cast iron  skillet with 4 of very hot peanut oil. Immediately flatten pancake with the  bottom of a pan or a metal spatula.    Cook about two minutes until golden brown and turn to brown on the second  side. Serve with apple sauce.    Apple Sauce: Core but do not peel about eight mutsu or Rome apples. Cook  with 1/4 cup of apple cider and cinnamon stick, 1/2 cup of dried cherries,  and 1/4 cup of sugar until mushy. Add 1 Tb of butter, stir to mix and  chill. Remove cinnamon stick.
