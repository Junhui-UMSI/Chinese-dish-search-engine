Whole Wheat Bread
White flour for kneading, Yeast, Warm Water; ~120 degrees, Vegetable oil, Honey, Whole wheat flour, Powdered Milk, Salt, 
In a large mixing bowl, combine water, yeast and honey, stir until yeast  dissolves. Add powdered milk and all the whole wheat flour. Stir until well  combine and dough is smooth. Dough will be very wet and sticky. Let rise 1  hour. Beat down dough (isnt this fun), add salt and oil.    Turn dough out onto a well floured work surface. Knead for 10 minutes with  white flour (you will use about 1/2 cup). Dough will remain very soft and  sticky. Divide dough in half and place in 2 well greased loaf pans. Bake at  350 degrees for 1 hour. Cover the last 15 minutes if tops are browning too  quickly. Cool in pans 10 minutes. Then turn out of pans, and cool on wire  rack. Makes 2 loaves. Recipe can be doubled.    ~ Thanks to Elizabeth B. of Michigan for this recipe. I adapted this recipe  from a 1930s depression era cookbook. This is the lightest whole wheat  bread I have found to date (ie. Not your typical lead brick).  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 474 by "bunny"  <layla696@ix.netcom.com> on Jan 7, 1998
