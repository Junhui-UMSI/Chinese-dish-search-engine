Blend in food processor. Makes + or - about a pint. Stores well in  refrigerator.    Now, some variations. Use habs, seeds and all. Serranos taste wonderful  but habs taste better and pack more kick. I use seeds and all, just cut  off the stems.    Add some olive oil while blending. Your mileage may vary.    For "dried hot red pepper flakes" I use my other killer app, habs and  chipotles, 1 to 1, ground fine.    Does 5 whole heads of garlic seem a bit much? Resist the temptation to  scrimp. Inconceivable that a C-H would be a garlic wimp.    You cant beat this combination of flavors. Add it to anything you can  think of. Let your imagination run wild. I use it a lot for salad dressing  bases.  For me, a dab of zhug, then olive oil and lemon juice, is all a  salad needs.
