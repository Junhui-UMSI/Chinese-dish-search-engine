Warm Cabbage Salad with Bacon and Roquefort
Finely sliced red cabbage, Crumbled Roquefort, Dry white wine, Heavy cream, Finely sliced green cabbage, Salt, Black Pepper, Shallot, finely minced, White wine vinegar, Plus, Thick-sliced bacon, cut, Dijon-style mustard, 
In a large heavy skillet over moderate heat add the bacon pieces,  generously season with ground    pepper and cook until crisp. Transfer the cooked bacon to paper towels to  drain and remove the skillet from the heat.    In a small saucepan combine the wine and shallots and simmer until reduced  to a thick syrup. Whisk in the cream, mustard, salt and pepper and continue  to simmer until thickened slightly.    Heat the skillet with the bacon drippings over moderately high heat and  cook the green cabbage, stirring, until it just begins to wilt, about 1 to  2 minutes. Transfer the wilted cabbage to a bowl and cook the red cabbage  in the remaining drippings in the same manner. Return the wilted green  cabbage to the skillet, add the vinegar and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir  in the cream mixture and cook, stirring, until cabbage is crisp-tender.  Serve the cabbage warm topped with the crumbled Roquefort and bacon.
