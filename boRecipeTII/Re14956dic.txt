This recipe was given to my by Judy Burtner, who was Home Extension agent  for Frederic Co. Virginia many years ago. She specifically called for this  being baked in cans....    This is a different tea bread, and is exceptionally good. It freezes well.    Combine eggs, oil, and milk. Beat until well blended. Sift together the  flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, cinnamon, and salt. Add to egg mixture,  and stir until combined. Stir in the carrots, coconut, cherries, raisins,  and pecans.    Turn into 4 greased/floured vegetable cans (like green beans come in). Bake  at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes. Let cool in can for about 5 minutes, then  cool completely. Refrigerate until ready to use.    Note: a regular loaf pan may be used or 4-5 mini-loaf pans.    Ill bet this would be great done in the "jar".
