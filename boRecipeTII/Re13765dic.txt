Pour cold rice over rice in strainer and lift rice with fingers (to remove  any impurities). Combine rice and 1 1/3 cups water and bouillon. Bring to a  boil, reduce heat. Cover and simmer 60 minutes.* Meanwhile cook bacon  partially and add mushrooms, green onion and thyme. Cook till bacon is  crisp and mushrooms soft. Drain off fat. Add to cooked rice. Season with  pepper. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Time consuming and expensive. Be  prepared to give wild rice as much cooking time as possible, occasionally  it will require a bit more time as it absorbs water more slowly than  regular rice. Source: Canadian govt publication
