Sugar, Fresh, Mirin, Light soy sauce, Napa cabbage, Boneless skinless chicken, Fresh shiitake mushroom, Salt, Green onions, Dark soy sauce, Basic dashi, 
Cut scallions into 2" lengths and half them lengthwise. Crisscross tops of  shiitake caps with a knife. In a large pot, bring dashi just to a boil,  then add the salt, soy sauces, sugar and mirin. Stir to dissolve, then  bring the broth back to a gentle boil, and add the chicken pieces. Simmer  until the chicken is tender, about 10 minutes, skimming any foam. Add the  onions, mushrooms, and cabbage and simmer another 2 to 3 minutes.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of unsalted water to a rapid boil. Add the  noodles, bring back to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they  just begin to soften,about 3 minutes. Drain noodles in a colander and rinse  under cold running water while rubbing noodles to remove surface starch.  Serve immediately, placing noodles in individual warm, deep bowls. Ladle  hot broth over the noodles, and arrange pieces of chicken, onions, and  mushrooms on the noodles. Serve immediately.    Yield: 4 to 6 servings    c. 1997, M.S. Milliken & S.
