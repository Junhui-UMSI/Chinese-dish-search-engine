I just found this. http://www.pacificharbor.com/caprial/ccrec.htm. Cooking  vegetables in parchment keeps them moist and flavorful, and it helps retain  the vitamins in the vegetables.    Preheat oven to 375?. Cut a 12-inch square of parchment paper. Fold the  parchment in half diagonally to form a triangle, then fold it back so it  lays flat. In a large bowl toss together carrots, onions, garlic, sweet  potato, leeks, zucchini, and yellow squash, and mix well.    Pile the vegetables in the middle of one triangle on the parchment.  Sprinkle the vegetables with the basil, thyme, savory, pepper, olive oil,  vinegar, and goat cheese. Fold the parchment over to form a triangle again  and crimp the edges tightly. Place in a baking pan and bake for about 20  minutes. The parchment will puff up and turn golden brown. Cut the  parchment open and serve the vegetables hot from the parchment. Serves  four.
