Baked Scallops and Mushrooms in Garlic Sauce
parsely, Flour, Scallops, olive oil, Fine bread crumbs, Mushrooms, White wine, Onion, Garlic, Red pepper flakes & salt, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Brush a shallow baking dish with 1 tbs. of the oil.  Bake the mushroom caps for 10 min. Combine stems, crumbs, onion, parsley,  red pepper and salt mix together well. Add scallops to the baking dish.    (If you really want to be artistic, plan it out so the scallops are a good  size to fit into the mushroom caps, and buy the same number of each. Then  you can stick one scallop in each mushrooms.)    Add the wine to the baking dish. Sprinkle the minced mixture over all, and  drizzle the remaining oil over. Bake for 20 more min, or until done.    Formatted and Busted by RecipeLu <recipelu@recipelu.com>  Posted to recipelu-digest by RecipeLu <recipelu@geocities.com> on Mar 22,  1998
