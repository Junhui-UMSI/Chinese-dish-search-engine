"Betty Crockers" Fresh Tomato Salsa
Lime juice, jalepeno, fresh cilantro, Salt, seeded, green onions, green bell pepper, garlic, 
Mix all ingredients.    Authors Notes: Here is the all-purpose southwestern favorite.  This simple  salsa is unbeatable when tomatoes are at their brilliant best. If time  permits, refigerate the salsa for two or three hours before serving, so  that flavors of the individual ingredients "marry". Serve it with any of  the tortilla dishes, grilled chicken or hamburger, or tortilla chips." From  "Betty Crockers Southwest Cooking".    My notes: I made this 6/3/96.  Was pretty haphazard about measuring <g>.  Turned out GREAT!  Even better next day!  Next time, lighter on the  cilantro, more lime, and MORE GARLIC!!! ......mmmmm....
