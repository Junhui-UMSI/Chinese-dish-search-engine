I cut that recipe down by 1/3 (1/2 the yeast), since my machine is for 2  c.for 2 c. flour.  Actually I use a little more than 2 c.  That makes a  thin ccrust for a 14" pan. Naturally, the best thing about the bread  machine machine is that it takes out all the steps.  Just pour it in and  let I usually use 40/60 or 50/50 wheat/white flour.    >From: Jeff Stehman  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : More with Less Cookbook
