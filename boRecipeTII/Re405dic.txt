Lemon Curd
Lemons, Lump or granulated sugar, Butter, Eggs, 
>From : Mrs. Beetons Book of Cookery    Lemon curd is not a true preserve but it keeps for a while in the  refrigerator. Use very fresh eggs bought from a reputable source.    Wash, dry and grate the lemons. Squeeze out the juice and put it with the  sugar in the top of a double saucepan set over boiling water. Stir  occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in  the butter. Leave to cool.    Beat the eggs lightly in a bowl. Pour the cooled lemon mixture over them,  mix well, then strain the mixture back into the pan or bowl. Place over  gentle heat, stirring frequently until the mixture thickens enough to coat  the back of a wooden spoon lightly. Pour into warmed clean jars. Cover with  waxed paper disks. Put on lids and label when cold. Leave for 24 hours to  thicken; store in the refrigerator. Use within 2-3 weeks.    Makes 1 lb.    Variation    Orangecurd.
