At the end of each month, The Cook and Kitchen Staff select some of the  best recipes sent to Recipe-a-Day and post them to the entire membership.  Todays offering is from Recipe-a-Day member "Wisecd." It will make a  fantastic addition to your casserole files.    You may elect to vary the flavor of this recipe by utilizing different  green peppers. Although the bell pepper is the most common pepper used in  many recipes, try a little roasted poblano or diced jalapeno pepper to heat  it up a little bit!    Thank you to all Recipe-a-Day members that took the time to send in a  recipe. Were just sorry we wont have an opportunity to publish them all!    In a large skillet over medium heat, brown ground beef and drain excess  liquid. Add taco seasoning spices as directed on the package, blend, and  reserve.    In the same skillet, saute onions and peppers (if desired) in 1 tablespoon  butter until tender.    Meanwhile, cook pasta as directed on the package and drain.    In a 9-inch by 13-inch baking pan, spoon stewed tomatoes into the bottom of  pan to cover. Layer remaining ingredients in the following order: pasta,  ground beef and taco seasoning, salsa, and cheese. Repeat layering process  until dish is full, making sure to finish the top layer with cheddar  cheese.    Bake in a pre-heated 400-F degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from  oven and let stand for about 5 minutes. Serve warm.  Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by Recipe-a-Day  <recipe-a-day@bignetwork.com> on May 29, 1998
