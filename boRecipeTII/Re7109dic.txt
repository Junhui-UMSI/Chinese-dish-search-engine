Dissolve the sugar in the water and milk, then add the yeast, stirring to  dissolve, and let sit for 10 minutes. Combine the flour, butter (which has  been cut into small pieces), and the yeast mixture, kneading until the  dough forms a smooth ball. Or, in a food processor with the machine  running, add the butter to the flour, then add the yeast mixture. Process  until the dough forms a ball, adding flour or milk as necessary. Let rest  for a few minutes, then process 1 minute more. Place in a lightly oiled  bowl, turning once to oil the top, cover and let rise until double in bulk.    Filling: Pour boiling water over the seeds, let stand for 5 minutes, pour  off the water and repeat, draining well. Cover with the milk in a saucepan  and bring to a boil, then strain. Grind with the steel blade in a blender  or processor until the seeds release the milk and turn white, then add the  sugar, honey, and butter. Cook in a heavy skillet for 1 minute over high  heat. Cool. When cool, add the egg whites and zests, blending well.    On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a long rectangle about  1-inch thick. Spread the filling evenly over the dough stopping 1-inch from  one long edge and roll up, making sure that the filling is sealed inside.  Place on a non-stick baking sheet, seam side down. Bake in a preheated 350  Degree F. oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Brush with the egg glaze and cool on a  wire rack.
