Potato Ala Picante
Shredded cheddar cheese,, Baking potatoes, well, Onion, cut in half, Pace Picante Sauce, Salt to taste, Butter or margarine, melted, 
These impressive and easy-to-prepare "pleated" potatoes are an ideal  accompaniment to all manner of meats, fish and poultry. Thanks to Ruth  Krening of Fort Morgan, Colorado for sharing her recipe.    Cut potatoes crosswise into 1/8" to 1/4" slices, being careful not to cut  all the way through so the potato remains intact. Place cut side up in a  shallow baking dish. Slip onion slices in between cuts in potato, rounded  side up. Brush or spoon butter evenly over potatoes; sprinkle lightly with  salt. Bake in preheated oven at 425F. 1 hour 15 minutes or until fork  tender. Remove from oven; spoon Pace Picante Sauce evenly over each potato.  Continue baking 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese; return to oven just until  cheese is melted. Serve with additional Pace Picante Sauce.
