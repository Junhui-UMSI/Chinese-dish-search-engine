Upside-Down Apple Pie
Apples, peeled, cored sliced, Pecan or walnut halves, Lemon juice, Brown Sugar, Pastry for 1 crust pie, Cinnamon, Salt, Granulated sugar, All-purpose flour, 
My note:  this recipe worked with a deep dish pie plate and one piece of  foil.  Used 8 cup measure to mix pastry, then measure apples, then poured  sugar mixture over the apples.    Line a 9 inch pie plate with a wide circle of foil. Take 2 pieces of 12  inch foil about 2 feet long.  Make a drugstore fold lengthwise resulting in  1 large square. Press into pie plate. Spray or grease heavily on bottom and  sides up to top edge of pie plate.    Place pecans or walnut halves round side down on bottom of foil in pie  plate.  Sprinkle with brown sugar.    Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in large bowl. Stir  well.  Stir apples and dry mixture together and spread over nuts in pie  plate.    Roll pastry and place over top.  Fold edges under and flute. (This makes a  rim to hold the juice when pie is turned upside down.) Turn up foil all  around. Trim foil leaving 4" high. (This may be more important if you have  a regular pie plate to keep filling from running over.)    Cut slits in pastry.  Bake in 350 F oven about 55 minutes until apples are  cooked.  Cover with large plate and invert so pie is upside down. Remove  foil carefully. Serve warm.    Source:  Companys Coming Pies by Jean Pare 1992 Shared and tested by  Elizabeth Rodier Sept 93
