Rebekahs Good Eggrolls
Prepared egg roll wrappers, Vegetable oil, Fresh bean sprouts, cabbage, Soy sauce, tiny shrimp, Salt, mushrooms, Sugar, Celery, 
From: "Sharon H. Frye" <shfrye@pen.k12.va.us>    Put oil into large skillet or wok, and heat very hot. Add bean sprouts,  cabbage, and celery. Stir fry together for about 2 minutes, or until  vegetables are tender-crisp and bright green in color. DO NOT OVERCOOK.  Remove from heat. Stir in remaining ingredients (except wrappers). Mix  well. Place in a colendar to drain.    TO FILL WRAPPER: Place 1/4 cup filling diagonally on wrapper. Fold corner  over filling and tuck point under. Fold up both edges, envelope style. Roll  over tightly till flap is completely wound around. Moisten flap to seal.    TO COOK: Heat oil in deep fryer to 375 degrees. Deep fry rolls, three at a  time, turning often, until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.    PS....I buy the pre-made duck sauce and hot mustard sauce for these.
