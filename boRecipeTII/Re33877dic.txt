Sweet and Sour Stuffed Tofu Ravioli
Jar prepared FF sweet and, Lemon, Frozen spinach; or fresh, Grated carrot, Egg whites or egg substitute, Soy sauce, Prepackaged FF won ton, Diced green onions, Soy Deli LF tofu, 
Process the tofu in a food processor. Add the carrot, egg whites soy sauce,  lemon. Process lightly. You can add more water if the mixture is too  gritty. Dont add too much.    Put the sweet and sour sauce in a sauce pan and add the diced green onions.  Heat thoroughly until the onions are slightly soft.    Prepare won tons:    Just lay a won ton on the table and put a gob of tofu filling on it. About  a heaping teasponful. Wet another ton ton and just lay it on top. Seal the  edges by just massaging them down. They seal naturally, because the dough  is a glue. Put aside so they dont stick together, because folks....they  will.    You can lightly steam them (use a bamboo steamer, or they will stick), or  just lightly brown them in a non-stick Pam sprayed pan. DONT over-cook  them, or they will get tough-- although some people adore them like that!    Serving:    Heat and drain the spinach well. Lay the won-ton ravioli on the spinach and  heat slightly on the plate in the microwave, with the plate covered to heat  thoroughly.    Serve with the sweet and sour sauce. You can make your own sweet and sour  sauce if the store bought is too sweet. You can do this entire thing in  about a half hour once you get used to it.
