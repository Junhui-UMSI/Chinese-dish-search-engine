Coarsely chop the chicken breast and toss it with  the lettuce, blending well. Peel, seed, and cube a ripe papaya. Put 1-1/2  cups of the fruit on top of the salad (store remainder refrigerator). Do  not stir. Drizzle with raspberry vinaigrette dressing (from Sunsets Salads  or commercial: Girards or S&Ws). Chill the salad in freezer while you  preheat oven and bake the cresant rolls. Top salad with crunchy wheat germ.  Serves two dinner or three lunchean portions.    NOTES : "Use Fruit Vinaigrettes!" suggested Kathleen Daelemans, chef at  Croces San Diego restaurant.
