Review:  "Polenta, cooked cornmeal, is a cinch in the microwave.  Here it  is topped with a vegetable melange from southern France."    POLENTA: In a rectangular 3-quart microwave-safe casserole, mix the milk  and water. Whisk in the cornmeal and salt.    Cover with vented plastic. Microwave on high power for a total of 12  minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed, stop and stir after 6  minutes.    Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.    RATATOUILLE: Coat a large no-stick frying pan with no-stick spray. Add the  oil and place over medium-high heat. Add the onions, garlic and green  peppers. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, or until the onions and  peppers begin to soften.    Add the eggplant, tomatoes, basil, oregano and black pepper. Cook, stirring  occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the eggplant is tender.    TO SERVE: Spoon the vegetables over the cornmeal. Sprinkle with the  Monterey Jack. Microwave for 1 minute, or until the cheese melts.    7 minutes attention: 35 minutes total.
