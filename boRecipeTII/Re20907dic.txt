From the Fannie  Farmer Cookbook.     Preheat the oven to 425!F.  Grease muffin pans.  (NOTE: Grease the bottoms  especially well!)  Put the oat bran, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon,  and salt in a mixing bowl and stir to blend. In a separate bowl, combine  the milk, egg whites, vegetable oil, and grated apple. Pour the apple  mixture into the dry ingredients and stir just to mix. Spoon into the  muffin pans, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Bake for 15-17  minutes, until golden brown. Makes 12 muffins.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
