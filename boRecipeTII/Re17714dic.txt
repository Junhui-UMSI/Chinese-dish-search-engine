Almond Roca
Walnuts Chopped Fine, Plain Hershey Bars, Margerine, Sugar, Almonds, Butter, 
Turn electric fry pan to high and melt the butter and margerine. Add sugar  stirring constantly. (shift heat as necessary). Do not let mixture get too  brown, as light tan is the desired color.    After 5 minutes, add almonds; and then cook as before for 5 more minutes.    Pour into an ungreased cookie sheet pouring off excess butter. Cool.    Meanwhile, melt chocolate in double boiler.    When candy is cool, frost top half and sprinkle with nuts.    Turn over and repeat.    Break into small pieces to serve.
