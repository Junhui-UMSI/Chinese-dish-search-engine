For a spicier version, include a diced jalapeno chili or two.     Rinse the rice well and set it aside to drain.     Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet that has a tight-fitting lid.  Add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt; saute over medium heat for about 5  minutes, until the onion is soft.  Add the garlic and wine and cook for 1  to 2 minutes, until the pan is nearly dry. Follow with the peppers (and the  chilies if you are using them), 1/2 teaspoon salt, the paprika, a few  pinches of cayenne, and the black pepper. Stir in the drained rice and  saute with the onions and peppers until it is heated through, about 3  minutes.  Pour the boiling water over, making sure that all the rice is  covered.  When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover  the pan, and cook until the rice is tender, just under 20 minutes. Gently  stir in the cilantro and serve.
