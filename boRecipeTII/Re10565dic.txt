Quick Mint Brownies
Box Brownie mix, Salt, ICING, Chocolate fudge topping, Butter, room temperature, Peppermint extract, Confectioners sugar, Chocolate chips or*, 
* chopped walnuts     Brownies     Brownies have been an American favorite for close to one hundred years.  Time your brownies carefully so they do not come out too "wet" or "dry":  test for doneness several times during baking.     Your guests wont know youve used a packaged brownie mix for this one-and  dont tell them.     Prepare brownies as directed on package, stirring chocolate chips or  walnut pieces into batter before baking. Let brownies cool, cut into 1  1/2-inch squares and refrigerate for 2 hours.     To prepare icing, cream together butter, salt, peppermint extract and  confectioners sugar until smooth. Spread over brownies. Let icing set.     Spread chocolate fudge topping over the top of each frosted brownie  square. Place the brownies in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. Remove and  serve or keep in a cool spot until serving.    Yield: 24.
