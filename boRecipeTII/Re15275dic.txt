White and Wild Rice Stuffing
Butter, Chopped mushrooms, (6 oz) white and wild rice, Boiling water, Seasoning packet, Chopped parsley, Pine nuts, 
Here are a couple of late entries to the stuffing sweepstakes, which I  found while going through my friends cookbook, "Tested & Tasted by Me," by  Sonja Appleton. In 1987, Sonja retired from her career in the operating  room at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, CA. Her colleagues were  distraught to think she would no longer be bringing her wonderful cookies  and casseroles to the departmental potlucks. I helped her put a little  cookbook together. Ten years ago I had never even heard of a recipe  management program, and I typed hundreds of her recipes clipped from  newspapers, package labels, friends notes and whatever, into an archaic  computer using Pagemaker 1.0!    saute 1/4 lb chopped mushrooms in 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan. Add  one 6 oz pkg. white and wild rice mix; saute 2 minutes. Blend in 2-1/2 cups  boiling water and seasoning packet. Cover and simmer 25 minutes. Stir in  1/3 cup chopped parsley and 1/4 cup pine nuts. Stuff neck cavity. Close  cavity with skewers. To serve: Spoon stuffing onto heated serving platter.  Pipe edge with mashed sweet potatoes.
