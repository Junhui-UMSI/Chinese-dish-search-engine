Pecans Worcestershire
Butter, Salt to taste, Tabasco sauce, Large pecan halves, Worcestershire Sauce, 
Melt butter, add other ingredients except pecans. Remove from heat, add  pecans, stir and mix, 5 minutes or more, so that each nut is coated and all  sauce is absorbed. Line cookie sheet with paper towels, pour out and spread  evenly. Bake at 300 degrees for 15 minutes. (I assume this is on the paper  towels!)
