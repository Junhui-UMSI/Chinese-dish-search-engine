Bearnaise Sauce #1
Tarragon Vinegar, Egg yolks at room temp., Clarified butter at room, Peppercorns, Salt to taste, Chopped shallots, Dried tarragon, 
Cook egg yolks in top of a double boiler over simmering water on medium  heat, whipping constantly until tripled in volume. Remove from heat and  whip in butter, a little at a time, until all is used. In a separate  saucepan, combine vinegar, tarragon, shallots and peppercorns and cook  until reduced by at least half. Strain the reduction into the egg mixture,  squeezing the tarragon to extract all the liquid. (There should only be a  small amount, about 1 tablespoon.) Stir until well blended. Place container  in a pan of warm, not hot, water until serving time.    CHE    MONTROSE, HOUSTON.    From the <Micro Cookbook Collection of French Recipes>.  Downloaded from  G Internet, G Internet.
