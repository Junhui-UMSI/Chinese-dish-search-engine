Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel, then season with salt and pepper.  Set aside. Preheat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat the  skillet with butter and heat until the butter foams, then add the steaks.  Arrange the shallots and garlic around the steaks. Add the pear halves,  cut-side down, around the steaks. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the  steaks are brown on one side, then turn. Sprinkle the fennel seed over  everything.    Mix the eau-de-vie and vinegar in a cup, then pour over the steaks. Cook  for about 3 to 5 minutes longer, or until the steaks are done, the pears  are tender, and the liquid has reduced to a thick dark syrup.    Serve each dinner plate with a salmon steak, 2 pear halves, and a topping  of the shallot-garlic balsamic syrup. Garnish with a generous amount of the  flat-leaf parsley.
