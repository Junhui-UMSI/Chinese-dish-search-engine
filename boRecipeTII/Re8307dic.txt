Potato Pierogi Pt 2
See part 1, 
Pierogi were traditionally served as a meatless dish during Lent, but  evolved into a popular sidedish. You might serve them with kielbasa, an  Eastern European spiced sausage. Martha Stewarts favorite kielbasa comes  from Kurowycky Meat Products, an outstanding Ukrainian meat market located  on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.    >From Martha Stewarts Web Page and formatted using MC_Buster.
