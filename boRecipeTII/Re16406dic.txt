1. Preheat oven to 375F. Top each chicken cutlet with 1 slice turkey  ham and 1 slice cheese: starting from narrow end, roll each cutlet  jelly-roll style and secure with toothpick.    2. In a small mixing bowl, combine 1 T mustard and the honey; spread  half of the mixture evenly over each chicken roll.    3. On a sheet of waxed paper arrange bread crumbs; turn chicken rolls  in bread crumbs, coating all sides and using all of the bread crumbs.  Arrange chicken rolls on a non-stick cooking sheet and drizzle each  with 1 tsp. oil. Bake until chicken is cooked through, 20-25 minutes.    4. While chicken is baking, prepare sauce. In a small saucepan,  combine broth and flour stirring to dissolve flour. Cook over medium-  high heat stirring frequently until mixture thickens, about 3-4  minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in sour cream and remaining  mustard. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3-4 minutes longer.  DO NOT BOIL.    5. To serve, remove toothpicks and cut each chicken roll crosswise  into 4 equal slices. Onto each of 2 serving plates pour half of the  sauce and top with four chicken roll slices.
