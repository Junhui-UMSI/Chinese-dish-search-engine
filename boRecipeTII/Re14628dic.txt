Date: Thu, 13 Jun 1996 18:30:04 +0000    From: "Asha Dornfest" <asha@hopf.dnai.com>  I just wanted to thank everyone for their inspired burrito suggestions.  I  will try them all!  Until then, I have come up with a surprisingly  delicious no-brainer - the naked burrito. Yes, its a burrito without a  tortilla.    1. Dump cooked brown rice in a bowl.    2. Top with beans of choice (heated pinto, black, or ff refried, canned  OK).    3. Spoon on a dollop or two of salsa (this is the ingredient that will make  or break the dish, so go for something really good).    4. Top with shredded vegies and condiments of choice (shredded lettuce,  tomatoes, and onions are a must, but after that, there are no rules.  Steamed assorted vegies, ff cheese and/or yogurt, etc)    Enjoy!  This meal is fast, delicious, colorful, and will satisfy most  burrito cravings.  btw, I made an amazing discovery Im sure Ive mentioned  before, but its worth saying again: Safeways "Southwest Salsa" (bottled)  is the best prepared salsa Ive ever tried. I am a real snob about jarred  salsa, usually preferring to make my own. But I love this stuff! If you  havent tried it, do. Its good. The Medium level of hotness is just  perfect in my opinion.
