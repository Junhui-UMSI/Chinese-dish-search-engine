1.  Make tapioca:  In medium saucepan, combine sugar, tapioca, milk, and  egg yolks; let stand 5 minutes. Heat to full boil over medium heat,  stirring constantly. Remove from heat; add vanilla. Mix. Cool slightly;  pour into 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish. Refrigerate 1 hour or until  cold.    2.  At serving time, place berries in bowl.  With knife, section orange,  allowing fruit and juice to fall into bowl. Toss; spoon over tapioca.    3.  Make caramel:  In small saucepan, combine ingredients; cover. Heat to  boiling over medium-high heat. Uncover; swirl pan until syrup is golden.  (If syrum begins to form crystals, cover; cook until golden, checking color  occasionally.)  Drizzle caramel over fruit and tapioca.    From:  McCalls September 1993    FROM: LAWRENCE KELLIE                 DATE: 08-04-93
