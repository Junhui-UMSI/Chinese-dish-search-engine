From: Julie Wright <julie@cucbs.chem.columbia.edu>    Date: Mon, 30 Aug 1993 02:36:00 -0400  Heres an all-purpose quiche recipe.  I put it together from the  suggestions in various cookbooks.    Beat egg white slightly, and spread a thin layer of egg white over uncooked  pie crust.  Prebake the pie crust at 425 F (400 for a glass pan) for 10-15  minutes.  Let cool.  Place cheese in crust.  Add one or more of the  fillings (about 1 - 1-1/2 cups filling(s) total). Mix eggs, both kinds of  cream, and spices. Pour gently on top of cheese and filling(s). Bake at 375  F (350 for glass pan) for 45 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the  middle comes out clean.    (I use the Basic pie crust from the New York Times Cookbook.)
