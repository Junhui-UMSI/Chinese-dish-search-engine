Contributed to the echo by: Bob Lester Assorted Meat herbs (whatever you  like) Put a LARGE oven cooking bag in an oblong baking pan (so that the bag  fits inside the pan). To the bag, add the venison. Add all liquids, then  veggies around the meat. Put the shrooms on top of everything else, then  the spices on top of them. You want to have about 1 inch of liquid in the  bottom of the bag, so if you need more, add a little water (or white  wine!).    Seal bag. Poke several small holes in top of bag to let steam escape. Bake  at 300-325 for 3-1/2 hours. (If you chop the veggies big, they wont  overcook).
