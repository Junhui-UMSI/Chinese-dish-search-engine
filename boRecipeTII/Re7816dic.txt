Unsalted butter (1 stick);, Cayenne (or to taste), S & P to taste, (7 oz) Italian tuna (in, Madeira (or to taste), Dry mustard, Heavy cream, 
In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or in a blender blend the  tuna with the butter, cream, mustard, and cayenne until the mixture is  smooth. With the machine running, add the 1/4 cup of Madeira or to taste  and season mixture with salt and white pepper. Transfer the pate to a crock  or divide it among ramikins, smooth the top and chill until it is firm.  Serve the pate with French bread or toast points.    *I cant find Italian tuna here. I use regular tuna..but on occasion have  used a smoked tuna.    Notes: This is wonderful!  Easy to prepare (minutes) and tastes grand.  I  dont tell guests whats in it till theyve taken the first bite..by then  theyre hooked.  Serve this pate at room temperature when it will glide on  bread without breaking into bits. Flavor is also enhanced at room  temperature. Makes 1 cup.  Serves a ton of people.
