Heat oil in large pot.  Add leeks and onion; cook over moderately low heat,  stirring often, until softened - about 10 min. Sprinkle with fennel and  stir 30 seconds.    Add potatoes, broth, and water.  Simmer 25 min, until soft. Add arugula and  cook about 10 min longer, or until stems are soft. Add salt, pepper and  liquor to taste.    Puree to rough or smooth texture, as you like.  Adjust seasoning. Serve hot  or chilled, topped with yogurt and garnished with arugula slivers. As  watercress changes potato soup into something that doesnt taste quite like  any of the individual ingredients, so arugula transforms this traditional  soup base.    Flexible, the soup can be pureed to a chunky or a smooth texture, and  served hot, as a main dish, or chilled, as a first course.
