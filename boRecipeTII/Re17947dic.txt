Amaretti Cookies
almonds, Powdered sugar, All-purpose flour, Egg whites, Granulated sugar, lemon zest, Almond extract, 
In a food processor, grind the almonds to a powder by pulsing off and on to  keep the powder loose. Mix the almonds with the powdered sugar and flour.    In a separate a bowl, beat the egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually beat in the granulated sugar until stiff.   Fold in the lemon zest and almond extract. Fold in the dry ingredients.    Pipe the mixture with a pastry bag using a round 1/4-inch tip into  1 1/2-inch rounds onto baking sheets lined with lightly buttered waxed  paper or parchment. Bake in a preheated 275-degree oven for 1 hour,  checking to make sure the amaretti don't brown. Turn off the oven and let the amaretti dry out for an additional hour--they should be very crisp.  Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator or freezer.
