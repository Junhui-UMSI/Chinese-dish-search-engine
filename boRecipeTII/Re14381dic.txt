Whole Wheat Blueberry Pancakes
Liquid Butter Buds, Egg beaters, All-purpose flour, Baking Powder, Frozen blueberries, Whole wheat flour, Sugar, Skim milk, 
Blend flours, baking powder, and sugar; stir in Egg Beaters, milk,  blueberries, and liquid Butter Buds until just blended. (Batter will be  lumpy.) On a preheated griddle sprayed with a non-fat cooking spray, pour a  scant 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook over medium heat until surface  is bubbly and bottom is lightly browned. Turn and cook until done. Remove  and keep warm. Serve with "light" syrup and liquid Butter Buds. You can  also top these with a dollop of Dream Whip for an extra special treat.
