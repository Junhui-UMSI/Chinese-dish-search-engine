Kings Cake
Yeast, Warm water, Milk, Flour, Butter, Sugar, Salt, Eggs, 
In a bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk and enough flour (about 1 / 2 cup) to make soft dough. In another bowl, combine butter, sugar, salt and eggs with the electric mixer. Remove from mixer and add soft ball of yeast dough. Mix thoroughly. Gradually add 2 & 1 / 2 cups flour to make a medium dough that is neither too soft nor too stiff. Place in a greased bowl and brush top of dough with butter. Cover with damp cloth and set  aside to rise until doubled in bulk about 3 hrs. Use remaining 1 cup flour to knead dough and to roll with hands into a "rope" shape. Place on a 14 x 17 inch greased cookie sheet and form "rope" of dough into an oval shape.  The center should be about 7 x 12 inches. Connect the ends of dough by dampening with water. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour (a bean, nut or tiny plastic baby may be placed in the cake if desired). Bake in 325 degree oven for 35 to 45 mins or until lightly browned. Decorate by brushing top of cake with corn syrup and alternating 3 inch bands of purple, green and gold colored granulated sugar (to color sugar, add a few drops of food coloring to sugar and shake in a tightly covered jar until desired color is achieved).
