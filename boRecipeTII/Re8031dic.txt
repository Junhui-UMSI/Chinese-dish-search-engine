Potato and Kale Soup
Garlic, Potatoes, Fresh parsley, Water, olive oil, Kale, Onion, Linguica, 
Since I am a first generation Portuguese, I feel "Qualified" to submit this  recipe for Portuguese Kale Soup, requested by TeAntae Turner. My mother  made this soup very often, and I have carried on the tradition with my own  family. Linguica is the sausage of choice for most Portuguese cooks, but it  is not available in many areas and keilbasa or chourico may be substituted.  Since I moved from California to Pa., I now have to wait for my annual trip  home to stock up on my favorite sausage. I believe Igor would enjoy this  soup too! I never measure when making soups, but will offer a recipe with  amounts. Chourico is pronounced...shore--ree-so.    Pour oil in large pan, add onions and saute until translucent. Add garlic  and saute another minute or two. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer,  covered, until kale is tender and potatoes are cooked, but not mushy. Add  salt to taste.    Serve with Cornbread, or a crusty French Bread. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest  by ChefAlice@aol.com on Apr 2, 1997
