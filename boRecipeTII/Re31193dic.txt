Banana-Blueberry Muffins
Eggs, Brown Sugar, bananas, Baking Powder, Ground cinnamon, Vanilla, Fresh blueberries, Flour, Salt, Butter, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease 12 2-1/2 inch muffin cups.  Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl. Beat bananas in  a large bowl with an electric mixer until mashed. Add eggs, brown sugar,  butter, and vanilla, beating until blended.  Stir in combined dry  ingredients with a wooden spoon until just blended. Stir in blueberries  until just combined. Spoon into prepared muffin cups, dividing batter  equally. Sprinkle tops of muffins with granulated sugar and bake 20-22  minutes, until golden brown. Remove muffins from pan and cool on wire rack.  You can substitute the 6 Tbsp butter with 1/4 c nonfat yogurt, and these  come out fine. The fat from the 2 eggs is negligible when divided by 12.    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS  1-201-822-3627  Posted by FAYLEN    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
