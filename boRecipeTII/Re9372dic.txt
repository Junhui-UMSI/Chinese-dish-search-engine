When the pan is smoking hot,  add the onions and shallots. Saute for 1 minute. Add the garlic, jalapenos,  beans, and cilantro. Cover with the chicken stock. Season with salt and  pepper. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 2 hours or until  the beans are soft. With a hand-held blender, puree the mixture until  smooth. Reseason with salt and pepper. If the mixture is too thick, thin  with a little water. If it is too thin, return to the heat and reduce until  sauce consistency.    For cracklins: In a smoking hot saute pan, add the pork skin. Render the  skin until crisp and brown, about 6 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain  on a paper-lined plate. Season with salt and pepper.    For the crepes: Fill each crepe with 2 1/2 ounces of the pulled pork,  season with salt and pepper. Roll the crepe like an eggroll, making sure  the ends are tucked in the crepe so the pulled pork will fall out. To  assemble, spoon 1/2 cup of the sauce in the center of the plate. Arrange  the crepes in the center of the sauce. Sprinkle with any remaining pulled  pork and the cracklins. Garnish with the peppers, fresh cilantro and  Essence.  Yield: 4 servings.
