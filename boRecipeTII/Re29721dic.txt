Bay leaf, GUMBO, Onion, Parsley, Shortening, Dozen oysters with water, Toes garlic, File powder, Rice, ROUX, salt and pepper, Shortening for sauteing, Flour, Thyme, Water; up to 6, 
Add flour to shortening. Cook over low heat. Stir constantly, to avoid  scorching, until very brown. Add onions, garlic, bay leaf, thyme, parsley,  salt and pepper.    Skin poule deau or teal, wash, cut up, salt and pepper. Fry lightly and  set aside. Make basic roux, add poule deau or teal and water. Simmer for  about two hours or until tender. If using, add oysters and oyster water (be  sure and pick over them by hand for pearls and bits of shell, and strain  the water.) Add file individually when ready to serve. Serve over rice.    Note: do not add file to a rapidly boiling pot or it will string (file  means thread). If you wish to season the entire pot, bring the temperature  down to a bare simmer, remove some liquid, let it cool and stir in the  file; then stir the mixture back into the pot. Do not bring it to a rolling  boil again.    from "New Orleans Lenten Recipes: A Multi-Ethnic Sampling" by Elaine Abboud  Mowad and Jean Sarrazin Sears, published in 1970 by the Louisiana Folklore  Society.
