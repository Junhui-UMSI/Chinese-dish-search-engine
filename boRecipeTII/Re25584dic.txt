I thought it was a great find, because it gave  some history about the Cocoa Beach area. The cookbooks theme is all about  space, and the contributors are all related to working at KSC, NASA, or any  other company having to do with helping put our people into space. I ran  across several recipes that I thought were interesting or were interesting  contributors (by virtue of who they were).  If anyone is interested in a  set of these books, please email me privately. I just love old cookbooks,  and I am always rumaging (sp) through swap meets and garage sales for some.    Mrs. Richard m.

Stir in grapefruit  sections and chopped celery.  Chill and unmold.  Serve with a whipped cream  and mayonnaise mixture. (Fresh grapefruit must be thoroughly drained or may  be difficult to gel)    EAT-L DIGEST 9 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
