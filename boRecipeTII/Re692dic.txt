Greek Cabbage and Rice Pilaf
Onion, White rice, Cabbage, Water, tomatoes  , Raisins, No-salt seasoning, Dried Oregano, Ground cinnamon, Lemon juice, Fresh parsley, 
Put everything in rice cooker . Stir. Cover and allow to cook until rice  cooker shuts off. Carefully remove lid, quickly stir mixture. Stir in lemon  juice to taste and the parsley. Cover and allow to steam for 10 minutes  before serving. Serve immediately.    Notes: I used Uncle Bens rice (If you use brown rice add more liquid).  Fresh tomatoes work as well as canned. Currents can be used instead of  raisins. I used green cabbage but other kinds would probably work just as  well.
