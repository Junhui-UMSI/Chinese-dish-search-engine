Set aside.    2. Place the ground nuts and shredded coconut in separate shallow bowls.    3. One at a time, tip the banana slices into the yogurt, then roll them in  either nuts or coconut. Place them in a pan, cover, and freeze for at least  10 minutes before servin. If not eating immediately, transfer to plastic  bags and keep in the freezer.
