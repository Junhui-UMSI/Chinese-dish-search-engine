Pineapple Ham Bake
crushed pineapple, Fully cooked ham, Ground mustard, Vinegar, Brown sugar, 
I found this recipe in the magazine Taste of Home. I cut the ingredients in  half because the recipe called for a pound of ham.    Combine the first four ingredients in an ungreased 2-qt. baking dish; mix  well. Stir in ham. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes or  until heated through. Serve witha slotted spoon. Yield: 8 servings.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Elise Smith <epksmith@SONIC.NET> on Apr 17, 1998
