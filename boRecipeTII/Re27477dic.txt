What to do with frozen tofu? Nikki Hazelton thinks it tastes like chicken  and suggests the following preparation. First she thaws the tofu and  squeezes the excess water out. While I dont think this tastes much like  chicken, I do think it makes a great sandwich spread. Enjoy.    NOTES : Cal  27.6, Fat 0.7g, Carb 1.4g, Fib 0.3g, Pro 3.7g, Sod 92mg, CFF  24.5%.
