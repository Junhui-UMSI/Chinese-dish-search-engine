Return bacon and fat to skillet.  Add onions and  garlic and saute until softened. Add tomatoes and 3/4 cup of basil and  bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer on low about 20 minutes, stirring  occasionally.    Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and toss with  a few drops of olive oil to prevent sticking. Keep warm.    Pour cream into tomato mixture and heat through.  Top individual servings  of pasta with sauce. Garnish with remaining basil and grated cheese.
