As requested, here is the recipe for the salad which accompanied our  Thanksgiving dinner. It is based on a recipe in Eating Wells Entertaining  edition, dated Jan. 1997. I liked the salad recipe but the dressing in the  original seemed a bit boring so I used one provided by Bill Spalding. I  think it was better with Bills dressing than the original. -Leslie.    Toast nuts in oven 350 about 5 minutes. Let cool.    In a salad bowl combine greens, and red onion. Drizzle dressing over and  toss.    Just before serving sprinkle pomegranate seeds and nuts over top.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 21 October 96    Date:    Tue, 22 Oct 1996 02:44:39 -0400    From:    Leslie Duncan <duncan@VIANET.ON.CA>
