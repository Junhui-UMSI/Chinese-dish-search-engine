Date: Mon, 1 Apr 96 8:33:53 EST    submitted by: rayna@iconz.co.nz  Hi folks. Greetings from Rayna in Tauranga, New Zealand. Its a beautiful  day here today. Just a touch of autumn in the air. :)    Heres an old favorite of mine. One I cant enjoy any more because there is  no Russian salad dressing on the supermarket shelves of New Zealand, as I  found in great abundance on the supermarket shelves in Southern Californa,  when I lived there. So if anyone could provide a recipe for Russian  dressing, I would be eternally grateful. Thanks!    Put chicken in shallow baking dish. Mix dressing, soup mix and preserves  with small amount of water. Pour over chicken and bake in 350 oven (180) 1  1/4 hours or until chicken is tender. Cover and stir occasionally. Good  with cooked rice and green vegetables.    Note: to serve for buffet or as appetizer, bone and cut raw chicken in bite  sized pieces; bake as above. If desired, transfer to a chafing dish or keep  warm on warming tray.    Microwave: Cut larger pieces of chicken in half. Add sauce mixture, cover  and cook 28 minutes till done. (Cant comment on this method. Never did  it!) How did you like it!
