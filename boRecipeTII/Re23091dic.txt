This dish is basically trout poached in a vegetable court bouillon flavored  with a cut-up trout.  It is a lovely way to offer the delicacy of trout,  and can be either a fish course, if the trout are 6-8 inchers, or a main  course if the trout  are 10-11 inchers. As a fish course for a game dinner  serve    the trout cold ( in an aspic if you wish-see below).    In a big saucepan or deep skillet with lid melt the butter and saute the  vegetables until the shallot is just soft.     Add the single cut-up trout and the remaining ingredients (except whole  trout), bring to a bubble, and simmer for ten minutes or so.     Add the dressed whole trout, cover, and simmer slowly for about  20-minutes.     If the dish is a main course, remove the fish, drain, and serve  immediately with melted butter and lemon juice or herb butter.     If the dish is just a fish course, allow the fish to cool in the liquor  and serve the drained trout with a slice of lemon.
