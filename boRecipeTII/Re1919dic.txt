By CATHY THOMAS The Orange County Register    Simmering the ribs in broth ensures tender, juicy meat. Afterward, chill  the broth and remove the congealed fat; add chopped vegetables or wontons  and youll have a delectable soup.    In a medium bowl, combine all glaze ingredients; stir to blend. Set 1 cup  of glaze aside to pass at the table.    Place ribs in a large pot or Dutch oven; add enough chicken broth to barely  cover (usually 2 quarts is enough). Add cilantro, ginger and garlic; bring  to boil. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer; simmer 30 minutes or until meat is  tender. Remove ribs and place on a jelly-roll pan; generously brush both  sides with glaze.    Heat grill to medium. Grill ribs, basting and turning often, until heated  through, well glazed but not blackened, about 10 minutes.    Add lime juice to the reserved glaze and heat. Place ribs on platter.  Garnish with lime slices and sprigs of cilantro. Pass reserved glaze to  spoon over ribs. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
