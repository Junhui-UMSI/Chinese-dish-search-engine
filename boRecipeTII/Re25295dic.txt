From: MeLizaJane <MeLizaJane@aol.com>    1.In the bottom of a 25-cm/10-inch ring mold cake pan, combine 1/3 C butter  with the soy sauce and swirl gently to mix well.    2.Sprinkle brown sugar over the butter-soy mixture; dont worry about the  lumps. Arrange the pineapple over the sugar, cutting any large pieces to  fit in a single layer.    3.Distribute nuts around the pineapple; set cake mold aside.    4.Sift the cake flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl.    5.In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form when the  beater is raised slowly. Add granulated sugar gradually; continue to beat  well after each addition until stiff peaks form.    6.In a third bowl, beat the egg yolks at high speed until they are very  thick and pale yellow. Using gentle folding motions and a rubber spatula,  alternately mix the yolk and flour mixtures into the egg whites. Fold in  remaining 1 T melted butter and almond extract.    7.Spread batter evenly over the pineapple in the cake pan. Bake for 30-35  minutes at 180C/350F.    8.Loosen edge of cake; let stand 5 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving  plate and serve warm, with the cream.
