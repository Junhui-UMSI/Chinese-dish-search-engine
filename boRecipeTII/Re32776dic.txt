Sweet Potato Pie
Unbaked pie shell, Vanilla, Grand Marnier, Butter, Cinnamon, Ground ginger, Evaporated milk, Yams, Eggs, Sugar, Nutmeg, , 
Mix together yams and butter in a bowl until well blended.  Add  remaining ingredients (except the pie shell), and beat with an  electric mixer, making sure to get the rid of the yam fibers, (These  gather on the beaters, so just wash them off and continue to beat.)  Pour mixture into the pie shell and bake for about 1 hour and 15  minutes, or until done (when a toothpick inserted in center of the  pie comes out clean).    From George Louie.    Makes 8 to 10 servings.    PER SERVING:  340 calories, 5 g protein, 45 g carbohydrate, 14 g fat  (6 g saturated), 81 mg cholesterol, 228 mg sodium, 1 g fiber.
