Pork Chop Cassarole
Salt, Dried rosemary, Condensed cream of mushroom, Pork Chops, sour cream, Cooking oil, Pepper, French- fried onions, Chicken broth, All purpose flour, Ground ginger, 
Here is one of my favorites out of the "Taste of Home 97" cookbook. In my  opinion the best cookbook ever!!!    In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, salt and pepper; dredge pork chops.  Heat oil in a large skillet; cook pork chops for 4-5 minutes per side or  until browned. Place in a single layer in an ungreased 13in x 9in x 2in  baking dish. Combine soup, broth, ginger, rosemary and 1/2 cup sour cream;  pour over chops. Sprinkle with half of the onions. Cover and bake at 350  for 45-50 min. Stir remaining sour cream into sauce. Top chops with  remaining onions. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 10 min. Posted to  bakery-shoppe digest V1 Number 039 by baschool@juno.com (ROBERT J  SCHOOLFIELD) on Apr 18, 1997
