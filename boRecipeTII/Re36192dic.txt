Beef Stock #2
Beef bones, Bay leaf, Cloves, Water, Carrots, fresh parsley, Whole peppercorns, Thyme, Onion, garlic, Celery seeds, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place bones in a roasting pan and bake for 30  minutes, turning once. Discard accumulated fat.     Transfer bones and remaining ingredients to a large stockpot. Bring  mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, partially  covered, at least 4 hours. Frequently skim the froth off the top.     Using a colander, strain stock. To defat stock, refrigerate until fat  hardens on the surface, then remove and discard. The stock may gel during  refrigeration; this is natural. Makes 2 quarts.
