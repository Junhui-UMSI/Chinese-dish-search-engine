Quick and Dirty Miso Soup
dashi, Tofu, Miso, Ginger, Scallions, 
From:    James Porter <porterj@LBM.COM>    Date:    Mon, 5 Aug 1996 13:12:40 -0600  >From: Kristen McQuillin    Make fish broth by boiling the fish flakes in about a quart of water until  the water is pale yellow and tastes fishy. Strain the flakes from the  broth.    Slice the scallions into very thin rounds, cut the tofu into small cubes  and add both to the broth. When the scallions are soft (just a few minutes)  add the miso and ginger. Heat (without boiling) to serving temperature.    NOTES: You can use "instant dashi" (like bullion cubes) or real fish to  make the fish broth.    Garlic (sliced into very thin ovals) is also very good in this soup.  Add  with the scallion and tofu.    EAT-L Digest  4 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
