Sweet Cherry Clafouti
Dark cherries; pitted, Flour, Milk; lowfat or whole, Brandy, Granulated sugar, Vanilla extract, Butter, Salt, Eggs; at room temperature, 
Preheat oven to 350?. Butter the bottom and sides of a 10-inch quiche dish  and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the sugar. Arrange the cherries in a  single layer in the dish.    In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs and the remaining sugar at  high speed until light and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.  Reduce the  speed to medium and gradually incorporate the flour and salt.  With the  mixer off, pour in the milk, brandy, and vanilla. Mix just until the  ingredients are blended. Carefully pour the mixture over the cherries. The  batter should come nearly to the top of the dish.    Place in the center of the oven and bake for 50 minutes until puffed and  golden.  Do not underbake; the batter puffs in the last 15 minutes of  baking. Remove to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes. The clafouti will  sink slightly. Sift the confectioners sugar over the top and serve warm.    Recipe by: Kitchen Garden (October/November) 1997    Posted to recipelu-digest by Nesb2@aol.com on Feb 9, 1998
