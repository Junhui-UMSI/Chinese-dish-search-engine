Veggie Stir-Fry
Soy sauce, Peanut oil, Broccoli; cut into small, Sesame seeds, Red bell pepper; cut into, Garlic, 
In a medium-sized skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but  not smoking. Add the broccoli and red pepper and stir-fry for about 3  minutes. Add the garlic and soy sauce and continue stir-frying for 3 to 5  more minutes, or until the broccoli is tender but still crisp. Sprinkle  with the sesame seeds and serve immediately.    NOTE: To make a successful stir-fry, be sure to stir the ingredients  continuously while frying. No peanut oil? Vegetable oil works, too. And if  you want to put in different or additional vegetables, go ahead!    Recipe by: MR FOOD    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1041 by Meg Antczak  <meginny@frontiernet.net> on Jan 24, 1998
