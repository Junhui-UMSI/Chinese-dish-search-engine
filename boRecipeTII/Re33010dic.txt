Basic Casserole Brown Rice in the Pressure Cooker
Brown rice, Salt, Water, Flavoring; (garlic clove), 
(From:Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure by L.J. Sass)    In a 1 1/2 or 2 quart casserole, combine all the ingredients. Place the  rack and 2 cups of water in the cooker. Lower the uncovered casserole onto  the rack with the aid of a foil strip. Lock the lid in place. Bring to high  pressure and cook for 20 minutes (for long grain brown, Wehani, brown  basmati) or 25 minutes (for short grain brown). Allow the pressure to come  down naturally for 20 minutes. Remove the lid. If the rice is not quite  tender, replace (but dont lock) the lid and allow it to steam for a few  more minutes. Lift the casserole with the aid of the foil strip. Fluff up  rice before serving.    This has always worked for me except that I have to cook it a few minutes  longer because of altitude. In fact, its the only way I can cook it  without having a really bad pan to clean up.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Richard M. Swanson" <sharpy@sedona.net> on Apr  5, 1998
