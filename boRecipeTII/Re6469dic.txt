Plums in Flaming Vodka
Finely diced fresh ginger, Water, Fresh plums, halved and, Vodka, Vanilla, Sugar, Almond extract, 
Im not making this one up either -- its from the San Antonio cookbook,  Flavors.    In a large saucepan, combine, sugar, water, and ginger and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until sugar is  completely dissolved. Add plums to syrup and cook 6-10 minutes, or until  plums are tender but firm. Remove with a slotted spoon to a heat-resistant  serving dish. Boil down sugar syrup until slightly reduced, pour over  plums, and cool to room temperature. When ready to serve, put vodka,  vanilla, and almond extract in a saucepan, bring almost to a simmer, and  ignite. Pour over plums and run for your life, oops, I mean, "and serve".  Good with a dollop of whipped cream. Serves 6-8. Posted to FOODWINE Digest  27 Jun 97 by Lyn Belisle <belisle@TENET.EDU> on Jun 28, 1997
