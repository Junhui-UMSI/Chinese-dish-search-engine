Bannock
Sugar, Flour, Butter, Milk, Salt, Baking Powder, 
This month, were delighted to bring you a quick and easy recipe for  bannock, from James latest cookbook, Peasants Alphabet.    Bannock is a non-rising bread that goes back to the days of the trappers,  hunters and covered wagon pioneers. They all made bannock at the end of a  long day when they were cold, tired and hungry.    Serve this delicious bread on a cold winters night, alongside a steaming  pot of chili or a big hearty stew. You may want to recruit the youngsters  into helping you. After all, its a great introduction to cooking andits  just messy enough to make it enjoyable.    Next time youre baking -- whether youre using a conventional oven, a  barbecue or even an open fire -- try out this recipe for bannock.    MIX the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar together in a bowl.    ADD the oil and milk (or water), stirring until you have a stiff batter.    DUST your hands with the flour and press the batter into a flat cake about  1/2 an inch / 1.25 cm thick.    POKE a hole in the middle (so it looks like a big donut).    HEAT a lightly greased frying pan over high heat for 1 minute, then turn it  to low.    PLACE the bannock in the pan, cover and cook for 5 minutes.    FLIP, cook for 5 more minutes and then cook a further 10 minutes on each  side (cook about 35 minutes altogether).    EAT immediately with lots of butter and jam or peanut butter.
