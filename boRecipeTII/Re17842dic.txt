Almost-Stuffed Pork Chops
Scallions; chopped, Dried parsley flakes, Pork loin chops; 1 inch, Fresh mushrooms; finely, Dijon-style mustard, Lime; Juice of (about 2, Coarsely crumbled cracker, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. Brush both sides of the pork chops with the lime  juice and place them in a 9" x 13" baking dish that has been coated with  nonstick vegetable spray. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the remaining  ingredients. Mix until well blended then spoon evenly over the top of the  chops. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cooked through.    NOTE: These can be prepared, covered, and refrigerated overnight before  baking. That way, you can put a fancy dinner on the table without having to  do any last-minute preparation. (I like that!) Oh, and for a little extra  oomph, I sometimes add 1/2 teaspoon dried ground coriander.
