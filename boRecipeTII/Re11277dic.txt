Ramen Cabbage Salad
Ramen noodles, Green onions, Almonds, Vinegar, Sugar, Sesame seeds, Water, Cooking oil, cabbage, 
Chop cabbage into small pieces, add sliced green onion to cabbage. Toast  sesame seeds and almonds on cookie sheet in oven. Be careful--they burn  very quickly!. Crush Ramen noodles* (Original Flavor) in package. Open and  remove broth package. Just before serving add crushed (uncooked) noodles,  sesame seeds and almonds to cabbage and onions. Dressing: Use a Good  Seasons salad dressing bottle--Add water, oil and vinegar as marked on  bottle. Add 1 package of Ramen seasoning and 1 T sugar. SHAKE WELL !!! Add  to cabbage mixture just before serving. Toss. This is WONDERFUL. I fixed it  for a Christmas dinner, and EVERYONE--even those who didnt like cabbage or  slaw loved it. Thank you Tom Hammond for supplying this great recipe. JL.
