Sweet Flan Pastry
Egg yolk, Egg, Unsalted butter, Sugar, Plain flour, Salt, 
Put the butter, cut into pieces, with the flour, sugar and salt, into a  mixer. Work it until the mixture resembles coarse semolina.    Add the egg yolk and the whole egg and do not work the machine for a moment  longer than necessary (VERY IMPORTANT) to amalgamate the eggs with the  flour mixture. Form it into a ball and leave it to rest in the refrigerator  for several hours before using it.    (The pastry will keep very well in the refrigerator for a few days, wrapped  in transparent film)
