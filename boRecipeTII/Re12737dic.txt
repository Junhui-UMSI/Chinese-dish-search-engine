Add, subtract, substitute to your hearts content.    Mix together pepper, m.s.g. and soy sauce and set aside.    Heat wok or frying pan hot and dry.  Add one half of the oil. Turn heat to  medium.  Add the eggs, and stir lightly so the whites and yolks are mixed  slightly. Remove from pan while still a little soft, and put aside.    Turn up heat; add remainder of oil and add the meats, bean sprouts and  scallions.  Stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the hot rice. Pour soy sauce  mixture and mix thoroughly. Put back the scrambled eggs. Turn off heat and  add the lettuce.  Stir and serve.    Substitutions and Variations:  The fresh bean sprouts may not be obtainable  in your area.  You may leave them out of the recipe and increase the amount  of shredded lettuce to 2 cups. A small green pepper, halved and finely  diced is also a good substitute for the bean sprouts, and will brighten the  color.    From: Jim Lees Chinese Cookbook Shared By: Pat Stockett
