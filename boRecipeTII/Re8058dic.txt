Potato and Spinach Soup
Salt, Spinach (chopped),, Cheese, grated, Evaporated milk, Worcestershire Sauce, Butter, Water, Potatoes, Onion (fresh),, 
In a 3-quart saucepan, saute the onion in the butter until the onion is  translucent (about 3 minutes).    Add water, potatoes, spinach and salt.  Cook until potatoes are tender  (about 20 minutes). Longer cooking does not hurt, but turn down the heat to  a simmer. Add milk and Worcestershire sauce. Reheat to near boiling, but do  not boil.  Stir in grated cheese.  Serve immediately.    NOTES:    *   A rich cream-style potato and spinach soup for a cold, winter day --  This recipe is adapted from one that the U.S. Department of Agriculture  used to distribute to potato growers in the 1930s. It is rich and thick,  almost a meal in itself, and is very easy to make.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  30 minutes.  : Precision:  no need to measure.  :  : Kathy Wright  : Harris Computer Systems, Ft.
