JELLY ROLL, Eggs, Sugar, Water, Vanilla, Flour, Baking Powder, FILLING, Kiwi, Cornstarch, Sugar, Cold water, 
I agreed with the suggestion to serve kiwi as an Israeli food at international night in November, and this recipe won rave reviews at a kibbutz engagement party several years ago.  Cake: Line a jellyroll pan with waxed paper that has been generously greased. Beat the eggs in a small bowl at high speed until thick and lemon colored (about 5 minutes). Pour eggs into a larger bowl, beat in sugar, gradually. Beat in water and vanilla on a low speed. Add flour and baking powder and beat until smooth. Pour into the pan. Bake until a toothpick  comes out clean, about 12-15 minutes. Loosen cake from the edges of the pan, invert on towel sprinkled generously with powdered sugar. Remove the wax paper. While hot carefully roll the cake and towel from the narrow end.  Cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Unroll cake and remove towel.  Spread filling over cake and reroll. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.      Filling: Slice kiwi and set aside Mix cornstarch and cold water until smooth. Add sugar. Put in saucepan and bring to boil, stirring constantly.  Add kiwi and stir another 1-2 minutes. Let cool.
