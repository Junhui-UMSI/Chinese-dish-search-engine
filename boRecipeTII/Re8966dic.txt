Here are ome recipes from a Brazilian cooking show that ive just  translated for you. I havent tried them all yet, but they looked real  yummy:    Sift the dry ingredients but the sugar. Beat the yolks with the sugar until  fluffy lemony colored. Beat in the boiling milk alternating it with the  flour and the cocoa. Whip whites until they form soft peaks and fold them  into the mixture. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven until a toothpick inserted  in the middle of the cake, comes out clean. Filling: Mix sugar and water  and cook stirring until sugar is dissolved.Continue cooking over low heat  until it begins to thicken. Add the rest of the ingredients and continue  cooking over low heat until thick. Let cool    Topping:    Stir together all the ingredients and cook over low heat , stirring, for 5  minutes.Let cool    Assembling:    Cut cake in half horizontally, and spread a thick layer of the filling. Top  with the second half. Spread chocolate topping. Decorate with white and  dark chocolate shavings.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Leon & Miriam Posvolsky <miriamp@POBOX.COM> on  Dec 18, 1997
