Heat the olive oil in a large pot, and saute the onions and green pepper  until soft.  Add the garlic and saute another minute or two. Coarsely chop  the fresh tomatoes, add them to the pot and cook, stirring, until they  begin to give up their juice. Coarsely chop the canned tomatoes and add  them, along with the tomato sauce and tomato past. Stir in the seasonings,  cover the pot and simmer the sauce over low heat 20 to 30 minutes, stirring  occasionally.    The Contadina tomato sauce and paste have significantly better flavor than  any others I know of. If you cant get Contadina, then a small shake of  tobasco will help (not enough to make it hot, just enough to give it a  little sparkle).    For all those people who THINK they cant make a pie crust, here is a  quick, easy, and CHEAP pie crust recipe. I think the trick is the boiling  water and fluffing the shortening with a fork so that it disperses evenly  throughout the flour.
