Asparagus and Leek Soup
Leeks; White & Pale Parts, Asparagus; Trimmed And Cubed, Vegetable oil, Lemon Rind, Chicken Stock, 
Be sure to wash leeks thoroughly under cold running water, spraying the  water in between all layers to rinse away any grit. Coarsely chop leeks.  Cut asparagus into 1 1/2 inch lengths; set aside.    In large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat; cook leeks, stirring  occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for  10 minutes longer or until very soft. Stir in lemon rind; cook for 1  minute. Add asparagus, stock and 1 cup water; bring to boil. Reduce heat;  cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until asparagus is tender. Remove and  set aside 1 cup of the asparagus tips. In blender, puree remaining soup in  batches until very smooth. (Soup can be covered and refrigerated for up to        1    day.)    Return soup to pot; reheat over low heat. Ladle into bowls; garnish with  reserved asparagus tips. Makes 8 servings.
