Margarine, Potato; peeled and grated, Sage, Poultry seasoning, Pork roast, Salt, Pepper, Thyme, Onion, Chicken; 2 whole chickens, Chicken broth, 
Place clean, chopped, skinless chicken, roast and seasonings in a large pot  and simmer for 1 1/2-2 hours or until meat falls away from bones. Debone  chicken and cut roast into 1 inch pieces. Return bones to pot and continue  cooking until stock is required.    Peel and grate potatoes. Place pulp in cloth bag, and squeeze until all the  water and starch is removed, and the potatoes are quite dry. Measure the  liquid from the potatoes then discard the liquid.    Loosen squeezed potatoes in a large pan, and gradually add the hot stock in  the amount equal to the liquid removed from potatoes. Stir slowly to scald  potatoes until they look jelly-like while making sure there are no lumps.  Add margarine to potatoes and mix until melted.    Cover the bottom of two 17x12x2 inch pans with half of the potato mixture.  Cover layer of potatoes with chicken and pork. Cover with remaining  potatoes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 1/2-2 hours, or until  crust forms on top. Serve immediately.
