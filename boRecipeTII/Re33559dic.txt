Immerse cabbage leaves in large kettle of boiling water for about 3  minutes, or until limp; drain.  Combine egg, milk, onion, salt, pepper,  beef and cooked rice. Place about 1/4 cup meat mixture in center of each  leaf; fold in sides and roll ends over meat.     Place in slow-cooking pot. Combine tomato sauce with brown sugar, lemon  juice and Worcestershire sauce. Pour over cabbage rolls. Cover, and cook on  Low 7 to 9 hours. Makes 6 servings. NOTE: instead of using the slow-cooking  pot, put them in a shallow roasting pan (covered) in the oven at 350  degrees for (just guessing) about 1 hour. Helen Jolly.
