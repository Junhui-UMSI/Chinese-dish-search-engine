Wanking Fresh Deathbrew
Fuggles Leaf hops, Hallertauer leaf hops, Crushed, Yeast, 80 L. crystal malt, crushed, 
Add  crushed malt to 5 gallons water at 135 degrees, stir, add a bit  of  near  boiling  water to get about 120 - 125 degree protein  rest.  After  thirty  minutes of stir-well-every-10-minutes (by the way, I use a  pair of  40  quart  cooler chests for mashing) add  boiling  water  gradually  (usually  takes 2 gallons) to raise temperature to 155 degrees. Do  this in  stages...add a quart or two, stir well, stick in  your  thermometer, give  it 5, read, add, repeat. It takes a while to equilibrate  tempera- tures in  the porridge, and you can easily bring your mash to 170 degrees (a no no)  if you add too fast. Let this sit with periodic stirring for a few hours  until converted. Sparge with 11 gallons of water. Collect  up all that good  stuff (I sparge off between 11 and 13 gallons depending on how long I want  to drink while boiling) and boil roil troil and trouble. About 30 minutes  before you finally tire of boiling, add 5 ozs.  Fuggles leaf hops. Rejoice  in the aroma! Turn off the boil. Caper briefly. Add 2 oz. Hallertauer leaf  hops. Cover. Cool. Pour into  fermenting  vessel, pitch yeast (the cake(s)  from your last brew, recently stripped of their beery covering. Or be  conventional, and use Whitbread  Ale  from  the packet). Ed. Note: Father  Barleywines original posting is extremely detailed. We edited it down for  this compilation, but you should take a look in  the archives at the  original if you have the time. It is time well spent. Oh yes, the gravity  on my last Deathbrew was  about  1.063,  which  I consider on the light  side. Very nice red color.
