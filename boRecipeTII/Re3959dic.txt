This is exceptional dinner party fare, impressive-looking and superb  tasting, flavored with herbs, sun-dried tomatoes, Tabasco sauce, garlic and  chevre. To Roast the peppers: Preheat the broiler. Slice the peppers in  half lengthwise, and core and seed. Lay the pieces skin side up in a  shallow broiling pan and set the pan 3 inches below the heat. Broil the  peppers until the skin blisters and turns black. Remove the peppers to a  plastic bag and close it; let them steam for 15 minutes. When they are cool  enough to handle, peel off the skin.    Place the lamb skin side down on a cutting board or other surface and pat  it dry.  Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper. Arrange the tomatoes and  roasted peppers down the center of the lamb, then roll up the lamb, secure  it with twine, and set it in a roasting pan. In a bowl, whisk the oil,  herbs, garlic, and Tabasco sauce. Pour the mixture over the lamb, turning  once to coat.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, turning once or twice.    Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Place the uncovered roast in the oven and  immediately reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Cook the lamb for 20 minutes  per pound, about 2 hours, or until a meat thermometer registers 125 degrees  F. for rare or 140 degrees F. for medium. Let the lamb stand for 15 minutes  before slicing. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, whisk  together the chevre, garlic, cream, and Tabasco sauce until the mixture is  well blended and heated thoroughly. Garnish with rosemary and serve with  the lamb.    From: The Tabasco Cookbook.
