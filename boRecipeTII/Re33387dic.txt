Basic White Bread (Zojirushi)
Salt, Vegetable oil, Yeast*, Water, Sugar, Powdered milk, Bread flour, 
*I use 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of the yeast from Sams.    Combine all ingredients in pan.  Set timer for Quick Baking (2 hours) and  light crust. Makes a 2 pound size loaf.    NOTE: This is a basic white bread that you can use as a base for other  flavored breads.  This bread has a nice firm yet light texture. I add basil  or Italian seasoning and/or garlic powder for an Italian flavored bread  thats great with spaghetti. I sometimes substitute 1/4 cup oatmeal for 1/4  cup of flour for the added nutrients.    Typed by R. Thompson (r-thompson@usa.net)  6-97 From Zojirushi Home Bakery  Super operating instructions.
