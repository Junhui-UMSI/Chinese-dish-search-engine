Potato Magic
olive oil, Black pepper, Onion, Salt, Potatoes, Cracker crumbs, Egg yolks, 
Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the potatoes in a soup pot and add just  enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce the  heat to medium and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or until fork-tender. Drain  off the water, mash and allow to cool. Coat a baking sheet with nonstick  cooking spray. In a small saucepan, saute the onion in the olive oil over  medium heat until tender. Add the sauteed onion, cracker crumbs, salt, and  pepper to the mashed potatoes; remash. With your hands, roll into balls and  place on the baking sheet. Brush with the egg yolks and bake for 40 to 45  minutes, or until crusty brown.    Recipe by: MR FOOD    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1041 by Meg Antczak  <meginny@frontiernet.net> on Jan 24, 1998
