Honey Mustard Garlic Dressing
Heads roasted garlic, Dijon mustard, Honey; up to 2, Cider vinegar, Unsweetened apple juice, Pepper +/- salt to taste, 
Since most of you seem to be in summer salad mode over there, heres one of  my favourite salad dressings from the Moosewood Cookbook.    Blend all ingredients. It will keep in refrigerator for about 4 days.  Delicious on salads, potatoes, other veges, etc.    Posted to fatfree digest by Robyn A Frankland  <r.frankland@mailbox.uq.edu.au> on Aug 19, 1998, converted by MM_Buster  v2.0l.
