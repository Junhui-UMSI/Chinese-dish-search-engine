"Seasoned Greetings" -- From the L.A. Times.    The most important ingredients in chili are the spices, and many cooks  jealously guard their special blends. But there is a way you can give away  your chili recipe without giving away the whole thing. Bottle your  seasonings and attach the recipe--without the spice instructions. Tell them  that information is too hot to handle. If you dont have a favorite spice  mix or chili recipe, you can borrow ours.    Remove sausage from casings and add with ground beef to large stock pot  over medium-high heat. Brown meat, then cook through, about 15 minutes.  Using slotted spoon to drain excess fat, transfer meat to large mixing  bowl. Discard any excess fat from pot. Heat olive oil in same stock pot,  add onions and cook over low heat, until translucent, about 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to low, stir in Basic Spice Mix, tomato paste and wine. Stir in  crushed and peeled tomatoes. Add kidney, black and pinto beans and simmer,  uncovered, stirring often for 30 minutes.    Serve with grated cheddar cheese, extra chopped onion and chopped cilantro         16    servings    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #227 by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on  Dec 07, 1997
