Hearty Beef And Vegetable Soup
Vegetable oil, Beef shanks with bone in, Onions, Carrots, Celery, Garlic, Pepper, Water, tomatoes, Salt, Cabbage, Potatoes, Fresh parsley, 
Here is a great soup recipe from the Montreal Gazette from last winter. The  good thing is that you can vary the ingredients according to what you have  on hand.    (3/4 cup barley or tiny dry pasta shells instead of potatoes)    (cauliflower and/or green beans can replace some of the cabbage)    In a large stock pot, heat oil & brown beef on both sides until nicely  colored. Transfer to a plate. Add onions, carrots, celery, garlic & pepper.  Cook 8 minutes or until softened. Return meat to pan & add water, tomatoes  & salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat & simmer, covered for at least 1 1/2  hours or until beef is tender. Remove shanks from pot with a slotted spoon.  Cut meat from the bone, chop, & return to the soup. Add cabbage, potatoes &  parsley & simmer, covered, 30 minutes more. Adjust seasoning to taste.    All you need now is a huge bowl, a spoon & a loaf of crusty bread on the  side!!
