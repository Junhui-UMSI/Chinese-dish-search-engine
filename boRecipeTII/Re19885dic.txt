From: tamale@aloha.net    Date: Wed, 03 Jul 1996 18:52:48 -1000  Around 1977, I was fortunate to take a class at the Los Feliz Jewish  Community Center (Los Angeles) with Judy Zeidler, before she became the  author of several great books on Jewish cooking. She was then a columnist  with the Los Angeles Times.    She proved how much she enjoyed cooks and cooking -- her sense of fun was  so infectious, and we all laughed so hard, that I came home covered with  flour, tahine, and apricot-pineapple preserves!    I now serve her tasty Apple & Spinach Salad to my family:    In a large bowl: Toss apples, onions and celery.  Sprinkle with juice of  one lemon to keep apples from darkening.    In a blender or small bowl: Blend mayonnaise, tahini, honey and remaining  lemon juice (misture will be thick).  Toss with apple mixture.  Cover and  chill.    Just before serving, toss salad with spinach.  Serve on a bed of spinach  leaves and garnish with sesame seeds.  Serves 4 to 6.
