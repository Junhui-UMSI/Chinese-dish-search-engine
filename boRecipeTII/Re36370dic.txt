NOTES:    *  A simple Mexican-style casserole with beef and cheese -- This a  conglomeration of several of my favorite Mexican casserole recipes. I took  what I liked best from each one and this is what it turned out to be. My  family devoured it instantly and completely, and it has become one of our  favorites. Yield: Serves 4-6.    *  You can adjust the seasonings to suit your own tastes; I listed  conservative amounts (for me, anyway!). You can also add salsa (homemade is  best) to the casserole, if desired. Serve with fried rice (plain or  flavored) and green salad.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 20 minutes cooking.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Victoria Cheadle  : Schlumberger Palo Alto Research, Palo Alto, California, USA  : cheadle@spar-20.arpa decwrl!spar!cheadle    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
