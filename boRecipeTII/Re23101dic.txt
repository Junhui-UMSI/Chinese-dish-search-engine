Vegetable oil, Salt, Head of cabbage; about 1, Sugar, White vinegar, Soy sauce, Cornstarch, 
Remove tough outer layers of cabbage leaves and discard. Cut the cabbage  head into quarters, cutting out and discarding the center core. Cut cabbage  quarters into 1.5 x 1" chunks and separate the leaves to make about 6 cups.  Combine salt, sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce and vinegar in a cup and set  aside.    Sprinkle cabbage with a little water to prevent burning during cooking.  Heat oil in wok and stir fry cabbage over high heat for 2 minutes    Stir the sauce in the cup, making sure all the sugar is dissolved.    Add sauce to cabbage in wok. Stir and mix well over high heat for another  minute. Serve hot or cold.    VARIATION: YOU MAY ADD 4 DRIED WHOLE CHILI PEPPERS TO THE OIL TO BROWN  THEM, THEN ADD THE CABBAGE. THIS IS SZECHUAN STYLE.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Sheri Matheson <sherim@PALACENET.NET> on Jan 2,  1998
