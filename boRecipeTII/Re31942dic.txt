Take care and have a great weekend!!!    1.  Combine the tomato paste with the water in a saucepan over medium heat.  Stir until smooth. 2. Add the cayenne pepper, chilli powder, salt,  cornstarch, vinegar, and dried onion and stir. 3. Chop the jalapeno slices  very fine.  You can use a food processor, but dont puree. The best kind of  jalapenos to use are those bottled for nachos or pizza. Add them to the  mixture. 4. Heat the mixture to boiling. Continue to stir about 3 minutes  and remove from the heat. 5. Let the sauce stand until cool, and then put  in a tightly sealed container and refrigerate. This will last for 1 to 2  months. Makes 3 1/2 Cups.
