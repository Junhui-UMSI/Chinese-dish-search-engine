ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW #EE2352    Preheat the fryer. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt  and sugar together. Beat in the egg and milk. Fold in the small diced  fruit. Refrigerate for 1 hour. In a sauce pot, combine the chopped mango,  lemon juice, water and sugar together. Bring the mixture up to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes or until the fruit is very  tender. Pour the mixture into a food processor and puree until smooth.  Remove and allow to chill for 30 minutes. In the hot grease, drop a heaping  tablespoon of the beignet. Fry 5-6 at a time and stir constantly for even  browning. Fry the beignets for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove  from the fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate. Powder the beignets with  powdered sugar. Spoon the coulis in the center of the plate. Place the  quenelle of ice cream in the center of the coulis. Arrange the beignets  around the ice cream. Garnish with powdered sugar and chiffonade of mint.
