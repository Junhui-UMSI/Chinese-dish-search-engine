Tofu Ice Cream Parfaits
Maple syrup, Sliced strawberries or, Ripe banana, Vanilla extract, Kiwifruit, Soft tofu, 
1. In a blender or food processor, puree tofu, maple syrup, banana, and  vanilla until very smooth and creamy. Pour into a shallow pan and freeze  overnight or for 8 hours.    2. Just before serving, cut frozen tofu mixture into small chunks and  quickly blend to the consistency of ice cream. Spoon into dessert glasses,  alternating layers with sliced strawberries. Serve immediately.    Note:  Although the banana is hard to replace since it adds creaminess and  masks any telltale soy taste, almost any fresh fruit in season can be  substituted for the strawberries or kiwifruit. Try blackberries, peaches,  pears, and apricots for variety.
