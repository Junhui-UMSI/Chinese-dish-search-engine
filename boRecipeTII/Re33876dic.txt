Sweet and Sour Stuffed Chicken Breasts
Contadina sweet & sour sauce, Seasonings:, Bread Stuffing, Boned & skinned chicken, 
Slightly pound chicken breasts to flaten evenly. Season lightly with garlic  powder, (salt and or pepper if desired). Place a teaspoon or two of  stuffing in center of each piece of chicken. For each breast: Fold one side  of chicken to the middle of the stuffing mixture, then fold the entire  portion over the remaining side. Place seam side down in a baking dish.  Pour the sweet & sour sauce over the chicken breasts. Cover with aluminum  foil and bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes. Carefully remove the tin  foil and continue baking for another 10 - 15 minutes.    Note: The original recipe came from either the Contadina can or Stove Top  stuffing container and called for the chicken to be seasoned with garlic  powder etc., covered and baked for 30 minutes without the sauce. The sauce  was to be poured over the chicken after the 30 minutes and cooked for  another 10 - 15 minutes. However, I found that even though the chicken was  covered it dried out a bit and the sauce did not have enough time to flavor  the chicken.
