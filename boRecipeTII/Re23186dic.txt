Tuna Casserole for One
Potatoes, Cream soup; mushroom, Peas; Frozen, cooked, Carrots, Water, Chow mein noodles, Onion, Tuna; 3 1/2 oz size, Butter, 
Cut up the onion, potatoes and carrots in pieces and cook together for 15  minutes.Drain. Mix all the vegetables with the soup & water, and add to the  tuna.    Pour into a buttered casserole and add dots of butter on top. Cover the top  with the noodles. Bake in a 350 degree oven about 30 minutes. Changes I  made from original: I used cream of chicken soup, I used leftover canned  peas and for the water to mix with the soup I used the vegetable water from  the carrots, potatoes & onions..
