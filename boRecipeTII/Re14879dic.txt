Preparation time: 35 minutes Chilling time: 2 hours or overnight Cooking  time: 7 to 10 minutes     1. Measure 3 1/2 cups flour; sift together with spices, baking soda and  salt; set aside. Beat butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until  smooth. Add sugar and mix on high speed until light and fluffy, 2 minutes.  Add egg and mix well. Stop the mixer and add molasses and lemon rind. Mix  on low speed to combine. Stir in dry ingredients with a wooden spoon.     2. Divide dough into four parts. Wrap each one separately in plastic wrap  and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.     3. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease baking sheets.     4. Remove one piece of dough from the refrigerator at a time. Roll the  well-chilled dough on a floured board or between sheets of waxed paper to a  1/8-inch thickness. Cut out with cookie cutters and carefully transfer to  prepared baking sheets, leaving 1-inch between each cookie.     5. Bake just until the cookies are lightly browned and set, 7 to 10  minutes. Do not overbake. Transfer from baking sheets to a wire rack and  cool completely before decorating. Decorate as desired. Store in airtight  containers.     Nancy Schubert of Schaumburg, Illinois took first place with these chubby  little  bears. She uses colored sugar, little candies and a classic royal  icing to decorate the bears. Confectioners sugar icing or tubes of  decorator icing can be also can be used. from the Chicago Tribune fifth  annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 3, 1992  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #339    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 11:24:27 +0000
