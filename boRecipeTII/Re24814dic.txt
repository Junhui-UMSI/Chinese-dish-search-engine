Aunt Marthas Peanut Butter Fudge
Peanut butter, milk, Sugar, 
Mix sugar and peanut butter together a bit and then add milk.    Cook very slowly, low heat (it burns), stirring occasionally, watch out as  it may stick to the bottom of the pan- when droplets from the pan form a  soft ball in cold water, one you can pick up in your fingers-stick the pan  in a sink of ice cold water and beat with a spoon until thick and shiny.  Pour onto wax paper or buttered plate.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Jennie Craig <jecraig@LAN-INC.COM> on Dec 5,  1997
