"The Bread Machine Cookbook" Semolina Bread
olive oil, olive oil, Sugar, Salt, Semolina flour, 1 POUND LOAF, Sugar, 1 1/2 POUND LOAF, Yeast, Bread flour, Salt, Water, Bread flour, Yeast, Water, Semolina flour, 
Bake according to manufacturers instructions. Authors notes: "Semolina  flour has a very high gluten content, and therefore makes an exceptional  loaf.  Expect a yellow-tinted interior and a well-developed wheat flavor."  My notes:  I made this bread 6/3/96.  I used durum wheat flour instead of  semolina.  Barney unplugged my machine, so I had to finish the second rise,  and bake it in the real oven.  It turned out great. This bread is not  sweet, it has almost a "sour" taste.  Holds up nice for sandwiches. Ill  make it again. Posted to MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #166    Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 14:49:42 -0400    From: Sleopo@aol.com
