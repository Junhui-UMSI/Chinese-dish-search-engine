Recipe by: CFA, Quick n Easy Home Cooking, Dec 1995 In a large mixing  bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. Add the cracker crumbs, onion and  apple; mix well. Work the sausage into the egg mixture until all of the  ingredients are evenly combined. Press into a well-greased 6 1/2-cup ring  mold. Unmold immediately onto a 10 x 15-inch jelly roll pan. Cover with  plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour, or overnight.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the plastic wrap and bake the ring  for 1 hour, or until nicely browned. Transfer to a serving platter and fill  with fluffy scrambled eggs. Garnish with fresh parsley and cherry tomatoes.  Serves 8 to 10. Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
