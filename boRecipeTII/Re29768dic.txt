1.  (I usually use 2 pans (because I add an egg) but you can make this with  one.) Heat oil in pans, saute onions and mushrooms, put aside when done.    2.  Fry tempeh on both sides. When nearly done, add a teaspoon or so of soy  sauce to each side and turn over to cook (it will splatter).    3.  While this is all cooking (and try to time it to all come out at the  same time), toast your bread and spread liberally with mayo (any variety),  spaghetti sauce or something gooey.    4.  Construct a sandwich with bread, tempeh, tomato, onion/mushroom  mixture, and other veggies (optional). Serve hot.    Authors Notes:    Here is one of my favorite recipes that use tempeh.      For an incredibly messy (and non-vegan) option, try adding a runny fried  egg to the sandwich stack. [BTW, its messy even without the egg - cut  sandwich in half for easier eating]. Tempeh only keeps in the fridge a  couple of days. But it keeps in the freezer for months. To defrost: poke  hole in the plastic with a knife tip or fork (both sides!) and put in the  microwave for about 1 minute (depending on thickness). Or soak unopened  package in hot (from tap) water for about 10 minutes.    Difficulty    : easy. Precision  : approximate measurements.
