"Okayu" - Japanese-style porridge.    While you wait for your water to boil:    Break apart tofu into little chunks (dice or just use hands) Wash spinach  well and cut into 1/4" segments Wash nappa cabbage and cut into 1/4"  segments take seed out of umeboshi and cut into small pieces    When water is at a nice rolling boil:    Add miso (make sure it completely dissolves in water) (At this stage, taste  to make sure you have enough miso in water and add more miso or water for  desired taste.) Add rice, tofu, spinach, nappa cabbage, and umeboshi Add  mirin or sake (optional)    Once the mixture come back to a nice boil, put cover on pot and reduce heat  to low simmer for 30 minutes.  Stir occasionally.  Cook longer if you like  a more creamier porridge.    This makes a nice replacement for soup on a cold day.  If eaten as a meal,  I like to puree some raw daikon with a tiny smidgin of fresh ginger, lemon  juice, and soy sauce as a garnish on top of my okayu.
