Witches Hats Treats
Peanut butter, Semisweet chocolate chips, White decorator icing, Rice Krispies, Assorted candies, Marshmallows, Margarine, 
Melt margarine in large micro-wave safe bowl on high for 45 seconds or  until melted. Add marshmallows; toss to coat with margarine. Cook on high 1  1/2 minutes or until smooth when stirred, stirring after 45 seconds. Stir  in peanut butter. Immediately add cereal; mix lightly until well coated.  Press into greased 9x13"pan. Cook chips in small micro-wave safe bowl on  high for 2 minutes, or until smooth when stirred, stirring every minute.  Spread melted chips on marshmallow and rice cereal mixture. Cool. Cut into  tall triangles so that the treats look like witches hats. (You may want to  leave a thin base along the bottom of the triangle to resemble the brim of  a witchs hat.) Decorate with decorator icing and candies, if desired.    NOTES : In the picture for these hats they have outlined the hat and brim  with white icing and then across the middle draw 2 lines with a little  orange square to look like a buckle above the brim.
