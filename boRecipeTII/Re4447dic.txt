With a pastry cutter, cut in shortening and  pesto until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center; add  water all at once. Stir in just until dough clings together. Turn out onto  a lightly floured surface. Knead gently for 10 to 12 strokes. Roll or pat  to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, dipping cutter  into flour between cuts. Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake  in a 450F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden. Makes 10 to 12  biscuits.
