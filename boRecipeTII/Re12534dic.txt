Yeolas Bread Pudding
Sugar, Pet milk (12 oz), Oleo, Slices stale bread, Raisins, Water, Eggs, Pecan pieces, (16 oz) fruit cocktail/juice, Vanilla butternut flavouring, 
Put everything in a large bowl and mix it up.  Yeola says that she  uses her hands to make sure its well blended.  Then turn into a  greased 9 x 13-inch pan and bake in a 400-degree oven for 1 hour  and 20 minutes.  From Justin Wilsons "Outdoor Cooking with Inside Help"  Ive had this with a delicious Jack Daniels sauce.  Ive looked  high and low, but cant find the recipe.  If youre ever in  Lafayette Louisiana go to Prejeans, one of the nicest Cajun  restaurants around.  They serve a great bread pudding there,  maybe you can talk them into giving you their sauce recipe.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cajun.zip
