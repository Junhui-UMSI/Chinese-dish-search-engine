Saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add the  balsamic vinegar. Turn into a mixing bowl and whisk in the 3/4 cup of olive  oil. Season with salt and pepper. In a food processor, combine the pecans  and 1/2 cup of the flour. Pulse until a fine ground crust is formed, but  not pureed like a paste. Season the crust with Emerils Essence.    In a shallow bowl, season the remaining flour with salt and pepper. Season  the egg wash and the legs in the seasoned flour. Dip each leg in the egg  wash, letting the egg wash, drip off. Dredge the legs in the pecan crust,  coating the leg completely. In a large saute pan, heat the remaining olive  oil. When the oil is hot, lay each leg into the hot oil. Pan-fry the legs  for 3 minutes on the first side, flip the legs over and remove the pan from  the heat. Place the pan in a 400 degree oven. Cook the duck legs for 6  minutes.    In a large mixing bowl, toss the spinach, red onions and vinaigrette  together. Add to a hot skillet until spinach is just wilted. Season with  salt and pepper. Mound the greens in the center of four plates. Lay each  leg on top of the greens. Garnish with black pepper.
