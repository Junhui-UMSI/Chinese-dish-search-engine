Poisson Cru
Halibut, Tuna steaks, Lime juice, Green bell peppers, Scallions, Salt, Tomatoes *, Onions, Eggs, Coconut top milk, 
* Tomatoes should be medium-sized, firm, ripe, stemmed, peeled and coarsely  chopped. Chill the halibut or fresh tuna steaks briefly in the freezer in  order to firm the meat and make it easier to cut, but do not let the fish  freeze completely. With a cleaver or large, sharp knife, cut the steaks  lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices, then cut each slice into pieces 1 1/2 inch  square.      In a deep bowl, mix the lime juice, onions and salt together. Drop in  the fish and turn it about with a spoon until the strips are evenly coated.  Cover and marinate at room temperature for at least 2 hours, or in the  refrigerator for 3 or 4 hours, stirring the fish occasionally.      When done, the fish will be opaque and fairly firm, indicating the it  is fully "cooked". Taste to make sure; if it seems underdone, marinate the  fish for an hour or so longer.      To serve, drain the fish and squeeze it slightly to remove all the  excess moisture. Place the fish is a serving bowl, add the tomatoes,  scallions, green peppers and hard cooked eggs and cocoanut milk and toss  them all together gently but thoroughly. Note: The term poisson cru means  raw fish. The recipe itself is similar to the civiche popular in many Latin  American countries which "cooks" fish in a marinade of lime or lemon juice  seasoned with onions, garlic and hot chilies.
