The Cook and Kitchen Staff are continuing to offer you recipes from our  "Back-to-School" collection. Todays recipe is a particularly festive mix  of textures and flavors that produce a hearty cold meal or eye-appealing  side dish.    Its great with a sandwich or a little leftover pizza. Your away-from-home  student will most likely prepare it with zeal, as it stores well  refrigerated for up to five days.    Prepare pasta as directed on package. Drain and rinse well with cold water.  In a large mixing bowl combine pasta with turkey or beef, Mozzarella  cheese, red onion, green pepper, ripe olives, and Italian salad dressing.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour, and serve cold.    Kitchen Staff Tips: This salad recipe may be prepared with any type of  pasta; just make sure to break it or cut it into bite-size portions before  cooking. A fresh spinach linguini is fantastic, as well as standard elbow  macaroni or bow tie pasta. It takes on a completely different character  when prepared with broken Ramen noodles. The fun is to experiment, and  enjoy preparing it. If desired, sprinkle your portion for serving with a  little Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper, just prior to  serving.
