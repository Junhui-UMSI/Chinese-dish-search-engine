Servings:  4    Rinse lentils and beans, discarding any that look suspicious, and soak in  clean water 4 - 6 hours, or overnight.  Put into medium saucepan, bring to  boil and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.  Add water if necessary.    Peel and chop onion.  Microwave on "High" 2 - 2 1/2 minutes until soft. [If  you prefer, you may saute the onion in about 2 T. oil.  I omit the oil to  keep the fat content down.  The flavour does not seem to suffer.] Chop the  Jalapena pepper.  (*) Adjust the quantity to your own taste and / or  tolerance.    Peel and crush the garlic.    Drain the lentil-bean mixture.  Reserve 1/2 cup of liquor.  In a food  processor puree the lentil-bean mixture, the onion, the garlic, the  jalapena peppers, the oregano, the chile powder, and the coriander leaves,  adding some of the reserved liquor as necessary to process. [The final  puree should be quite thick.]    Pre-heat the oven to 325 F.    Assemble as follows on an oven-proof plate, pizza-pan or cookie-sheet:    Place a flour tortilla on the *lightly* greased surface. Cover with  lentil-bean puree [4 - 5 T.].  Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Add  another flour tortilla and repeat, saving enough cheese to cover the top of  the final flour tortilla.  Bake for 20 - 30 minutes.    Remove from oven and allow to "firm-up" for 5 - 10 minutes before serving.    Garnish with salsa, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce.  Serve with rice,  Couscous and / or corn.    The amount of oregano, coriander leaves, chile powder, or jalapena peppers  may be varied to suit individual tastes.  I use more peppers! If youre  prone to "problems" with beans, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. Hing [Hing is a mixture of  rice-flour, turmeric and asafoetida <ass-uh-fuh-TEE-duh> found in most  East-Indian specialty stores.  It can significantly reduce flatulence.
