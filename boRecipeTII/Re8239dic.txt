She gave no measurements -- I guess the recipe might be in  one of her cookbooks -- so I improvised. This is really simple, fast (with  help peeling and washing, probably only about 30 minutes total to make) and  quite good. It is also a very pretty soup, creamy with bright green flecks.    Peel and coarsely chop potatoes. Trim leeks, slice in half longwise and  separate under running water to remove all sand and dirt, then coarsely  chop. Clean and quarter mushrooms. Place all in large pot and just cover  with water. Add salt, about 2 teaspoons, and bring to boil. Simmer until  potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Ladle 1/2 of cooked potato mixture  into food processor and add half of the spinach. Process until smooth and  thick. Repeat with rest of potatoes and spinach. Add about 1 Tablespoon  butter buds for flavor and thin with skim milk if needed. Serve hot. Makes  about 6-8 servings (although 2 of us ate at least half of it at one  sitting, with just fresh crusty french bread along side!)    Notes on variations from Mollies original version: I thought I used too  much water at first and removed some before I processed the soup. It was  then thicker than I wanted, so I thinned it with the milk. The milk and  butter buds were not in Mollies original version. She used watercress, but  suggested that spinach, or any other green, would also be good.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #49    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
