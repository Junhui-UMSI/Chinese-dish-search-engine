*    Use fresh or frozen Pompano or other fish fillets in this recipe.  **   Pimentos should be drained and chopped.  There should be about 1/4       cup.    Thaw fish fillets if frozen.  Cut parchment paper or brown paper into 6  12-inch squares.  Place 1 fillet on half of each piece of parchment paper.  Sprinkle with a little salt.  In a saucepan, cook onion and annatto seed  in the oil until the onion is tender.  Stir in the orange and lemon  juices, pimentos, olives, and parsley.  Simmer, covered, for about 5  minutes.  Add the hard cooked eggs.  Spoon 3 Tbls of the sauce over each  fillet.  Fold parchment paper over the fillet.  Seal by turning the edges  up and folding.  Place the packets in a 15 X 10 X 1-inch baking pan.  Bake  in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until fish is  done.  Cut packets open with a large X on the top, fold back each segment.   Transfer paper packets to dinner plates.  Garnish with shredded lettuce  and sliced radishes, if desired.
