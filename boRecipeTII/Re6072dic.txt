Pizza Crust-Bbs
Vegetable or olive oil, Dry yeast, Warm water, Salt, Flour (high gluten, 
Mix 2 cups of the flour, the yeast and salt. Add the water and oil, and mix  thoroughly. Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough can be worked by  hand. Knead thoroughly. Allow to rise for 30 minutes.    After the rising time, roll out the dough to fit whatever pizza pan or  baking dish you prefer. Top as desired, then bake completed pizza for 12 to  14 minutes at 475? F, testing for doneness after 10 minutes.    Additional note: Since I originally found this recipe, Ive learned that a  pizza stone is by far the best way to bake a pizza at home. Follow the  directions that accompany the stone, but typically you need to preheat both  the oven and the stone (i.e., put the stone in the oven in its final  position while preheating the oven) for at least 20 minutes before placing  the pizza in the oven to bake. The crust should come out just great!  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Julie Bertholf <jewel1@ix.netcom.com> on  Feb 24, 1998
