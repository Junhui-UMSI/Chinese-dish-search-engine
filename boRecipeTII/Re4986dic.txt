Bring another pot to a boil and add you peppers. Let  them soak for 3 to 4 min. Remove peppers and stuff in jar. Putting a towel  over the mouth of the jar and hitting the bottom helps settle the peppers  so you can add more. Add a couple of pieces of garlic and fill the jar to  about 1/2" below the lid. and quickly seal the jar. Process in a boiling  water bath for 10 minutes. Let sit on shelf for 30 days before eating.  Should stay fresh for up to a year.    This is an adaptation of a recipe that I found at the home page for the  Cooperative extension of Texas. It listed a long list of spices to use and  I just didnt feel like shelling out 10 to 15 bucks on some spices so I  bought the pickling spice for 2.45.    If you search high and low, youll find some recipes for jellies as well or  just make up your own.    I made a very simple fruit salsa by simply throwing 4 habs, a can of  crushed pineapple, and two small cans of mandarin oranges into the blender  and ended up with a scorchingly beautiful orange and yellow salsa.    The main thing is having fun by experiment with different things. I suggest  you try some things with store bought chiles so you wont feel bad about  losing your own home grown chiles to a horrendous concoction that your dog  wont even sniff.
