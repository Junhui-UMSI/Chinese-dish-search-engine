Slice the ribs apart and place in a large cast iron skillet. Cover with  salted water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer over low  heat for one hour, or until the meat is fork tender but not falling from  the bones. While the ribs are cooking, prepare the sauce. Melt the butter  in a saucepan and saute the finely chopped onion. Stir in the water,  vinegar, catsup, bottled sauce, lemon juice, and seasonings. Bring to a  boil, stirring, and remove from heat. Place the ribs in a shallow pan and  cover with the sauce, coating the ribs evenly. Place in the refrigerator  for at least two hours. Barbecue the ribs on an outdoor grill over  moderately hot coals, basting with the sauce and turning often until well  browned. Typed by Carolyn Cloe Dont *WE* feel superior!!!!
