In a small mixer bowl or food processor bowl combine cheeses; let stand to  soften.  Add basil or oregano, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot  pepper sauce; beat with an electric mixer on low speed, or cover and  process till well combined. (Mixture will be crumbly). Form into a ball.  Shape into a 4-1/2 inch round about 1 inch high. Wrap in clear plastic  wrap; chill several hours or overnight.    Unwrap cheese round; place in a 6 inch cast-iron skillet or heavy pan. Cut  into 6 wedges; separate wedges slightly. Place skillet or pan on the rack  of a smoker or grill over slow coals. Cover and smoke for 5 to 7 minutes or  til softened and heated through, checking often to make sure the cheese  doesnt overmelt. (The cheese shouldnt loose its shape or start to run.)  Top each wedge with a pimiento slice and herb sprig, if desired. Serve with  warm vegetables and bread. Makes 6 appetizers.    *It is important to use process cheese.  Process cheese melts smoothly,  giving an acceptable texture.    **If you like, blanch or boil the vegetables ahead of time, cover and  chill.  Wrap in foil and reheat on grill while the cheese smokes.    From: 1990 Best-Recipes Yearbook--Better Homes and Gardens Shared By: Pat  Stockett
