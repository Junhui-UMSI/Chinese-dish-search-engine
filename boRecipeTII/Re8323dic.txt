Prepare the vegetables. Have a medium-size saucepan of boiling salted  water. Add the potatoes and cook until tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Lift  out, letting them drain well, and peel. Set aside. Add the diced carrots  and cook until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Scoop out with a strainer or  slotted spoon and set aside. Add the peas and cook until barely tender,  about 3 minutes; remove and drain.    In a large bowl, mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Add the crema and  mix to combine. Add the egg and mustard, continuing to beat until the  mixture is smooth and fluffy.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    In a medium-size skillet, melt the butter over medium high heat until  fragrant and sizzling but not browned. Add the onion and garlic and cook,  stirring for 3 minutes, until the onion is translucent. Add the parsley,  cook for 1 minute longer, and beat the mixture into the mashed potatoes.  Stir in the diced carrots, peas, pickled onion, olives, and jalapenos.  Taste for seasoning and add the pepper and optional salt. Transfer the  mixture to a buttered 2-quart baking dish and bake 20 minutes. Serve at  once.
