China Moon Chili-Orange Oil
Corn or peanut oil, Japanese sesame oil, Oranges with unblemished, Shockingly pungent dried red, Chinese black beans; (do not, Cloves garlic; lightly, 
Makes about 2-1/2 cups    Choose oranges with unblemished skins that have been kept as free as  possible of waxes and dyes, then wash them carefully with a light liquid  detergent, warm water, and an abrasive sponge. The effort may seem  excessive, but it makes a difference. So too will a sharp vegetable peeler  that will pare off the flavorful skin (zest) and not the bitter white pith.    1. Wash the oranges as described above. Peel away the thin layer of orange  zest (leaving behind the white pith) and finely mince it.    2. Combine the minced zest with all of the remaining ingredients in a  heavy, non-aluminum 2- to 2-1/2 quart saucepan. Bring to 225* to 250*F on a  deep-fry thermometer over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, and  let bubble for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand until cool or  overnight.    3. Scrape the oil and seasonings ("goop") into a glass container, cover,  and store at cool room temperature.    Menu Suggestions: Be creative with the "goop" made from the seasonings as  well as the oil. A spoonful stirred into noodles or meat loaf is a tasty  revelation.
