Shake  vigorously to mix oil and vinegar before using some on a salad.  I prefer  to add salt to the salad itself at the last minute rather than include it  in the dressing. Somehow that tastes batter to me. This will keep for at  least a month, gradually changing character so that each salad is a little  different than the last. If it gets a little heavy on the vinegar with use,  add a bit more olive oil late in the game.    Ron from Minnesota, USA where olive trees are rare indeed.
