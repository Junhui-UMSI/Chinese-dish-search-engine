Pimentos Grilled Chicken with Raspberry Butte
Tarragon, Breasts (approx 1 1/2 lbs), Raspberry wine vinegar, Shallot, chopped, Red wine, (optional), Salt and pepper, Pesto, Fresh raspberries, Unsalted butter, Raspberry jam, Boneless, skinless chicken, 
Cook the chicken on a grill or under a very hot broiler in the oven for  about 3 to 5 minutes on each side, depending on their thickness and the  intensity of the heat. (The chicken can also be sauteed in a frying pan.)  Set aside. In a large frying pan over moderately low heat, melt butter and  saute shallot until translucent, but not browned. Add pesto, tarragon,  vinegar, jam and wine, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine  well. Add the chicken and raspberries and cook on low heat for about 5  minutes, turning the chicken occasionally, to heat through and blend the  flavors. Serve accompanied by pasta.
