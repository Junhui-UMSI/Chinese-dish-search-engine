The Practically Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie
Brown sugar, Eggs, Baking soda, white and dark sugar, Vanilla extract, Chocolate chips, Flour, Salt, level, semisweet chocolate chips, sweet Butter, 
Preheat oven to 3750. Mix the flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl  and set aside. Use a stand-type electric mixer to mix the two sugars  briefly at low speed. Add the butter in small gobbets, mixing first  at low speed and then at high. Beat the mixture until its pale,  light, and very fluffy. Add the vanilla at the mixers lowest speed,  then beat at high speed for a few seconds. Add the eggs, again at the  lowest speed, switching to high speed for the final second or so. The  eggs should be well beaten in, and the mix should look creamed, not  curdled. Add the flour mixture, a half cup at a time, mixing at low  speed for about one minute, then at high speed for a few seconds.  Scrape down the bowls sides with a spatula, add the chocolate chips,  and mix at low speed for about 10 seconds. If need be, scrape the  bowls sides again and mix for a few more seconds. Put Tbls. of the  mix on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake until the cookies are pale  golden brown (nine minutes in an electric oven, 10 to 11 minutes in a  gas one). Remove and let cool on a rack.
