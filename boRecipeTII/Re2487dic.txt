"Game birds have been cooked with cabbage for a very long time... this  dish is a composite from an eighteenth century recipe..  It is recommended  for an old rooster whose tenderness may be suspect."       In the casserole you expect to use, try out (render) the bacon until you  accumulate some fat, then add the prosciutto and cook until both begin to  brown.       Add the onion and carrots and cook 2 to 3 minutes, then add the herbs  and the salt and pepper.       In a kettleful of boiling, salted water blanch the cabbage sections for  5 minutes.  Drain and dismantle one quarter to make a bed of its leaves on  top of the vegetables, herbs, etc.       Lay in the trussed birds, fit in the remaining three cabbage sections,  and pour in the stock and the wine.       Bring to the boil, then simmer, covered, for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.    Note:  You can add livers to this dish:  saute 4 to 5 chicken livers with  the onion and carrots, then when the livers have lost their pinkness, smash  and stir them into the bacon, ham, and vegetables before you lay in the  cabbage leaves.    _LL Bean Game and Fish Cookbook_, Angus Cameron and Judith Jones, 1983.
