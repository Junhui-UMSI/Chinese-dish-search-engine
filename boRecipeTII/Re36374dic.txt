In a large mixing bowl stir together 1 1/2 cups of the flour, yeast,  ginger, nutmeg, and cloves; set aside. In a 1-quart saucepan heat and stir  milk, brown sugar, margarine or butter, and salt just till warm (120 - 130  F) and margarine is almost melted. Add to the flour mixture; add pumpkin.    Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides  of the bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a spoon,  stir in raisins and as much of the remaining flour as you can.    Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the  remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic  (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl;  turn once to grease the surface. Cover and let rise in warm place till  double (30 to 45 minutes).    Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let  rest 10 minutes. Lightly grease an 8x4x2" loaf pan. Shape dough into a  loaf; place in the prepared pan. Cover and let rise till double (25 to 30  minutes).    Brush top with milk. Bake in a 375 F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or till loaf  sounds hollow when tapped. If necessary, cover with foil the last 10 to 15  minutes to prevent overbrowning. Remove from pan. Cool on a wire rack.  Makes 1 loaf (16 slices).

Such ovens were the heart of every colonial home and baking in them was an  all-day affair.
