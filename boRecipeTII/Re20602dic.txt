Generously oil a 9-inch square pan & dust  with flour.    2. Place the egg whites in a large bowl, and beat with an electric mixer at  high speed until they form sturdy peaks.    3. In another large bowl, combine apples with all remaining ingredients  (including optional nuts & cranberries) & mix well.    4. Use a rubber spatula to fold the beaten egg white into the apple mixture  until fairly well combined. Transfer to the prepared pan, and bake about 30  minutes - until a probe comes out clean. Cool before slicing. Serve plain  or dusted with powdered sugar. NOTES: As its name suggests, this cake is  very light & fluffy, thanks to the presence of 8 beaten egg whites (& the  absence of egg yolks, butter, oil or dairy products). A few tips:    1. Separate the eggs when cold, then let the whites come to room  temperature before beating them.    2. You can grate the apples in a food processor with the grating  attachment.    3. Be generous when you oil & flour the pan. This cake has a tendency to  stick.    4. If you cant bring yourself to throw out the egg yolks, save them to  brush over bread (I buy the litre containers of egg whites at the  supermarket, so theres no waste., stimps).
