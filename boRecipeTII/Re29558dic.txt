PASTRY: Preheat oven to 425 degrees.    In a bowl, with a pastry blender, or in a food processor, blend or pulse  together flour, butter and salt until mixture resembles meal.  Add 4  tablespoons ice water and toss or pulse until water is incorporated.  If  necessary, add remaining ice water to form a dough and form into a disk.

FILLING: In a large heavy skillet cook onions in lard over moderately high  heat, stirring, until very soft and golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer  onions to a bowl to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together remaining  ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and whisk in onions.    Pour filling into prepared shell and bake in middle of the oven until  filling is set and top is lightly browned, 25-30 minutes.
