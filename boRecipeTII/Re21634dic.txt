Apple Slice Cake
Flour, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, Frozen apple juice, Sugar, Egg white, Salt, Concentrate, Ginger, 
Cream apple juice concentrate, sugar and egg. Add dry ingredients, mix, and  put into a 9" round non-stick baking dish. (If the mixture is not smooth  like cake batter, add up to 1/8 cup water.)    Bake 15-20 minutes at 350.    When baked and almost cool, slice in half and fill with softened apple  chunks (microwave apple pieces until there is some sauce and then use).    Mix 1/2 cup icing sugar with enough milk to make icing. Add 3 drops of red  food colouring. Ice the cake.    Recipe can be doubled.
