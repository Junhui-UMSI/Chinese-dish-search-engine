Three-Grain Filled Onion Rings
Egg whites, Cornmeal, Sugar, Oat bran, Buttermilk, (8-10 oz each) sweet, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Vegetable oil, All-purpose flour, 
Peel onions and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch thick slices. Remove centers  of slices to leave 1/4-inch thick rings. (Reserve centers and end pieces  for other uses. They will keep in a plastic bag for several days if  refrigerated.)     Prepare batter by combining flour, cornmeal, oat bran, sugar, baking  powder and soda.     Beat buttermilk, egg whites and oil. Stir into dry ingredients to make a  relatively smooth batter.     Heat a lightly oiled griddle to 350 degrees. Place onion rings on griddle.  Spoon batter into each ring just to fill. Cook until bottom sides begin to  brown. Turn and cook until other sides are done. Serve hot as bread or  vegetable side dish. Yields 4-6 servings.
