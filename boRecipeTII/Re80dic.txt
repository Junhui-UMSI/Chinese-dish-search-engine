Combine the sugar, flour, cornstarch and salt in a saucepan and gradually  stir in the water. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Gradually  stir the mixture into the beaten egg yolks, return to low heat and cook,  stirring, two minutes. Stir in the butter, lime juice and rind and cool  slightly. Pour into the baked pastry shell and cool. Top with meringue and  brown in the oven. Meringue Topping: Beat egg whites until light and  frothy. Add the 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar and continue beating until the  whites are stiff enough to hold a peak. Gradually beat in 6 tablespoons  sugar and beat until the meringue is stiff and glossy. Pile the meringue  lightly on cooled pie filling, spreading it until it touches the edges of  the pastry to prevent the meringue shrinking. Bake in a preheated hot oven  (425 degrees) until the top is brown, 5-6 minutes.    NOTES : 1. You may use your own pie crust recipe, including crumb crusts if  desired.
