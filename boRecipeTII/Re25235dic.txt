Tony Pockas Hot Dog Sauce
Salt, Cayenne pepper, Black pepper, oleo, Sugar, Garlic powder, Chili powder, Ground beef, Tomato juice, 
Mary Kennedy of Summerville sent me a recipe from a place made famous on  the old "MASH" TV show. "This recipe came from Tony Pockas restaurant in  Toledo. It is a great restaurant made even more famous by Klinger on "MASH"  when he was always calling for their ribs and such to be sent to their unit  in Korea."    Place all ingredients in a slow cooker on low and cook 5 hours, or simmer  on stovetop for 1-1/2 hours. Freeze in desired amounts.
