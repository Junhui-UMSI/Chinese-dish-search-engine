I couldnt resist this soup recipe using fava beans. Its from a Sicilian  cookbook. Its pretty adaptable, just leave out the oil.    1. Soak dry beans for 1 hour in cold water; drain. Bring a large pot fo  lightly salted water to a boil. Add the bans, onions, carrot, celery, and  bay leaf.    2. After water returns to a boil, reduce heat so that the soup slowly  simmers. check the beans after 45 minutes and if they still feel hard,  continue cook8ing until they are almost soft.    3. Add teh fennel and dill, cabbage, beet leaves, and endive leaves. Add  salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 25 minutes    4. Add the rice. cover and cook for 15 minutes. Serve with a sprinkle of  Parmesan cheese on top.    Serves 8. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #197 by JBennicoff@aol.com on Sep 1,  1997
