Mix all remaining ingredients, including the 1 teaspoon lemon juice, in  a copper pot.    3. Over a medium fire, beat vigorously until the mixture thickens. Do not  let the mixture come to a boil.    4. Pour the zabaglione over the strawberries. It is very important not to  let the mixture come to a boil. If necessary, remove the pot from the fire  from time to time until of desired consistency.
