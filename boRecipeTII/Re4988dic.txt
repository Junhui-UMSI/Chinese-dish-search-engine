Pickled Peppers or Chiles
Salt, or fresh hot chiles, Red or green sweet peppers, Vinegar, Olive oil; optional, Water, 
Wash the peppers or chilies thoroughly.  Cut around the stem of each large  pepper and pull out the stem with attached core and seeds.  Leave the  peppers whole of cut them into sections or strips, as desired. Hot chilies  may be stemmed and seeded, of left whole with stems intact. Make two small  slits in whole peppers or chilies.    Mix the vinegar and water; heat to a simmer - 150 F to 160F. The vinegar  should NOT be allowed to boil.  Add the salt    Pack the peppers of chilies rather tightly into jars.  Pour the hot vinegar  mixture over the peppers to within 1/2 inch of the jar rims.  Or, if you  wish to add olive oil, pour the vinegar to within 3/4 inch of the rim and  pour oil to within 1/2 inch of the rims. The peppers or chilies will be  coated with oil when they pass through the oil layer as you use them.    Cover jars and process for 15 minutes in a boiling water bath.
