Grated Apple Pie
Nutmeg, Eggs, Melted margarine, Vanilla, Grated apples; (4 medium), Pie shell, Sugar, Flour, Cinnamon, 
This recipe is for the "apples based desserts" theme. I made this last week  for Shabbos and it was very nice. It was easier than my usual apple pie and  looked very pretty. I served it warm, but I assume that it would be fine  cold as well. - Deena    source: a "Mr. Food" cookbook    Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Add eggs, margarine, and vanilla. Fold in apples. Pour mixture into pie  shell. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower temperature to 350 degrees and bake for  60 to 65 minutes. Cool.
