Strawberries with Raspberry Sauce
Superfine sugar, Fresh raspberries, Fresh strawberries, 
This is from the Dean Ornish _Eat More, Weigh Less_ (yeah, right) cookbook.  Its good. Its intended to be a dessert unto itself, but being a sinner, I  think it goes well over ice cream or pound cake, too. Only the low fat  varieties, of course.... (cough) ;)    Stem the strawberries and place in a serving bowl (I also halve the  strawberries, mostly because the berries we get in the markets here are so  huge). Puree the raspberries in a blender or food processor with as much  sugar as you need to sweeten them to taste. Strain to remove the seeds and  pour over the strawberries. Set aside at room temperature for a half hour  before serving. (I put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours after  giving them a slight smoosh with a potato masher.)
