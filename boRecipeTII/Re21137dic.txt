Canadian Living, January 1997.    Place dried mushrooms in small bowl; pour in 1 cup boiling water. Let stand  for 20 minutes or until softened. Strain through cheesecloth-lined sieve,  reserving liquid. If using shiitakes, cut off tough stem end. Slice  mushrooms into thin strips; set aside.    Meanwhile, peel carrots. On cutting board and using sharp chefs knife,  slice carrots diagonally; set aside. Using damp cloth or paper towel wipe  button mushroom caps clean. Cut off tough stem ends; slice caps thickly. In  large sauce pan heat oil over medium heat; cook onions and garlic, stirring  often, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add carrots and both kinds of  mushrooms; cook, stirring often, for 15-20 minutes or until mushrooms are  lightly browned and liquid is evaporated.    Stir in thyme, sage, pepper and salt. Stir in tomato paste, soy sauce,  vinegar and reserved soaking liquid. Add barley; cook, stirring, for 1-2  minutes or until liquid is absorbed and barley is well coated.    Add stock and water; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer, stirring  occasionally, for 50 minutes. Uncover and cook for 20 minutes or until  slightly thickened.    Soup can be prepared to this point and refrigerated in an airtight  container for up to two days; rehear gently, adding up to 1/2 cup/125ml  more water to thin if desired.    Trim spinach; flatten and stack leaves with stems all at one end. Starting  at long side, tightly roll up; using sharp chefs knife, slice crosswise  into 1/2-inch (1cm) wide strips. Stir into soup; cover and cook for 3  minutes or until wilted.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #374, by Peg Baldassari  <75402.3465@compuserve.com> on 15 Jan 97.
