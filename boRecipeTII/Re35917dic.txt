Turn  mushrooms over and broil for another 4 minutes.  Remove from oven.    Saute onions and garlic in a nonstick pan until both have brown a bit.  Use  sauteeing liquid of choice if necessary (balsamic vinegar is nice).    In a bowl mix onion/garlic mixture, breadcrumbs, italian seasoning, and  parmesan.  Add water, a couple of tablespoons at a time, until mixture is  moist enough to stick together well (do NOT make this soupy).  Stuff  mushrooms generously. If desired, sprinkle a little more cheese on top of  each mushroom. Place mushrooms back on non-stick baking sheet and bake at  400 for 20 minutes or until tops are brown. Enjoy!
