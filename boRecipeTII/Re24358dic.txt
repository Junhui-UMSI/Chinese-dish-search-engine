Triple-Chocolate Fudge Brownies
Salt, Eggs, Unsweetened chocolate, unsalted butter, Semisweet chocolate chips, Vanilla, All-purpose flour, bittersweet, Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and butter and flour an 8-inch square baking  pan, knocking out excess flour. In a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan melt  bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and butter over low heat, stirring,  until smooth and remove pan from heat. Cool mixture to lukewarm and whisk  in sugar and vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well until mixture is  glossy and smooth. Stir in salt and flour just until combined and stir in  chocolate chips. Spread batter evenly in pan and bake in middle of oven 25  to 30 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Cool  brownies completely in pan on a rack before cutting into 16 squares.  Brownies keep, layered between sheets of waxed paper in an airtight  container at cool room temperature, 5 days.
