Potato Swiss Chard Soup
Chopped fresh parsley, Onion, Black Pepper, Vegetable stock, Red potatoes, Garlic, Swiss chard, Carrot, Dried thyme, Bay leaf, Ribs celery, 
This was in the local paper (Marin Independent Journal) and was one of the  best soups Ive tasted:    In a soup pot, saute onions, celery and garlic until softened - about 5  minutes. Add potatoes, carrot, bay leaf and stock.    Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes.    Add Swiss chard, parsley, thyme and cook an additional 10 minutes. Add  black pepper. Remove from heat. Puree in batches in food processor (I used  blender).    If serving hot, reheat 5 minutes. If serving cold, cover and refrigerate  several hours or overnight.    Serves 4.
