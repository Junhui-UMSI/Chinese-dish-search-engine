Crusty French Bread
Yeast, Flour, Sugar, Salt, Water, 
Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.Set "baking control" to 11 o'clock.  Select "French bread" and push Start.Note: In the full size recipe I used two tablespoons granulated garlic to make a very good garlic bread that when slathered with butter and placed into an oven to heat.  This made an EXCELLENT addition to spaghetti.
