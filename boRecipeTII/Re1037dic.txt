Coddies
Baking potatoes, Cod, Butter, Egg, Chopped parsley, Flour; for dusting (matzo, Oil/butter for sauting, OPTIONS, Curry powder; OR onion, OR, 
Cook the potatoes. Mash em chunky.    Cook fish 8 min. at 350.    Add melted butter, egg, parsley and whatever of the above options (I favor  curry powder, which is traditional, or Dijon mustard, a tiny bit of sauted  chopped onion, and a dollop of Worcester) You can mix and match these to  your own taste.)    Flake the fish into the potato mix and mix well t combine. Mold into flat,  round, hamburger sized cakes. Dust with flour and saut in a shallow layer  of hot oil/ butter for about 4 minutes per side or until lightly browned.
