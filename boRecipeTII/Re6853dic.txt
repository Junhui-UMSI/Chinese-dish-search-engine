Polynesian Nut Bread
Salt, Butter, Pecans, chopped, Shortening, Eggs, slightly beaten, Flour, Maraschino cherries, Baking soda, Sugar, Raisins, Very ripe bananas, 
Cream shortening, butter and sugar. Add beaten eggs and bananas in chunks.  Beat until bananas are broken and disappear into mixture. Dredge nuts and  raisins in a little flour and set aside. Sift together flour, soda, and  salt. Stir into banana mixture; blend in nuts and fruits.    Pour into 2 large or 4 small loaf pans. Bake at 350 degree oven for 1 hour  or until center springs back to touch.    Let stand 10 minutes. Turn out on wire rack to cool.    NOTES :  I like to use 3 or 4 bananas and a can of drained crushed  pineapple. Great served with a spread of equal parts of cream cheese and  crushed pineapple.
