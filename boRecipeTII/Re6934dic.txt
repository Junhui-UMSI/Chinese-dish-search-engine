Poor Mans Cake
Cinnamon (Or To Taste), Raisins, Allspice, Sugar, Pinch Of Salt, Lard *, Cloves, 
*    The original recipe calls for Lard.  I dont know if shortening will       work or not.    Boil together all ingredients.  Add water just enough water to cover  raisins.  Boil until raisins are tender.  Cool.  Add 1 t baking soda and  enough Unbleached flour to make a stiff batter.  Pour batter into 9-inch  round cake pan.  Bake in moderate oven until cake springs back when touched  lightly (about 1 hour at 350 degrees F).  Serve warm or cold with cream,  custard sauce or powdered sugar frosting.  Walnuts may be added to batter  just before baking.    From "Trail Bosss Cowboy Cookbook" by Society of Range Management.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/west.zip
