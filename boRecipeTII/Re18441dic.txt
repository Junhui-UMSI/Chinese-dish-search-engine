From: kneadles@esosoft.com (Hugs)    VICTORY: Mix and with together flour; baking powder and salt.  Cream sugar  and shortening until fluffy as whipped cream.  (IF hard shortening is used,  cream thoroughly before adding sugar.  Vegetable shortenings come already  creamed and should be kept at room temperature at all times.) Add vanilla  extract.  Stir in the well beaten eggs. Add sifted flour mixture  alternately with milk, starting and finishing with flour. Blend thoroughly  between each addition, working quickly and lightly to keep the batter as  smooth and fluffy as possible. Bake in a prepared loaf pan, 9x5x3", in a  moderate oven 350 F. for about 50 minutes.  An 8" square pan 2" deep will  require about the same time.  Or bake in two prepared 9" layer cake pans at  375 F. for about 25 or 30 minutes.    NUT LOAF CAKES: Add cinnamon to the flour mixture before sifting.  Add nuts  to the finished batter.    PEANUT BRITTLE CAKE:  Use only 1/2 cup sugar instead 3/4 cup.  Add crushed  peanut brittle to finished batter.    CHOCOLATE MARBLE CAKE:  Divide batter in half. Melt chocolate over hot  water; add to 1/2 half of batter.  Drop batters by alternate alternate  tablespoons into a greased, paper-lined loaf pan.    CHOCOLATE SPICE CAKE: Add cloves and cinnamon to flour before sifting. Add  1/2 grated orange rimd to creamed sugar and shortening.  Melt chocolate  over hot water.  Add to creamed mixture.    CHOCOLATE CHIP CAKE:  Fold semi-sweet chocolate, coarsely grated, into  finished batter.    SPICY RAISIN CAKE:  Add cloves, cinnamon and allspice to flour mixture  before sifting.  Add raisins to flour and spice mixture after sifting. Fold  into creamed mixture alternately with milk in the usual way.    MOCHA NUT CAKE: Substitute coffee for milk.  Add chopped nuts to finished  batter.
