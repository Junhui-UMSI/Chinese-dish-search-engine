Here is a recipe for my favorite vlf cheesecake. It is from the Susan  Powter cookbook "Come On America, Lets Eat."    Spray pie pan with nostrick spray. To make crust, combine sugar and graham  cracker crumbs. Shake into pie pan, lightly covering sides and leaving a  thick layer of crumbs evenly on the bottom. To make filling, preheat oven  to 350 degrees. Beat sugar and cream cheeses together until creamy. Beat in  remaining ingredients. Pour into pie pan and bake for about 45 minutes  until set.    I omit the whole egg and use 5 egg whites instead. To me it tasted about  the same. I used a food processor to combine the filling ingredients to  make it easier.    I think it tastes best if chilled overnight. it taste great topped with  your favorite pie filling but is not necessasry. Posted to fatfree digest  V97 #039 by viv_park@juno.com on Mar 27, 1997
