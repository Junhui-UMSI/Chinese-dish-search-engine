1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine fresh tomatoes with sun-dried  tomatoes; set aside.    2. Pour oils into a 9- by 13-inch baking dish; place in the oven to heat  the oil, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add pancetta and return to the oven until  pancetta starts to brown, tossing occasionally with a spatula, about 5  minutes. Stir in tomatoes.    3. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked  and form a sauce.    4. Remove from oven; stir in parsley. Season with salt, if necessary.    5. To serve: Cook 1 pound dried pasta, such as fusilli (spiral-shaped) in  salted water, following package directions. Drain. Serve sauce over pasta  and pass 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese at table.    * Timesaver Tip: Sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead, covered, and  refrigerated, or it can be frozen. To freeze, spoon into a freezer  container, cover, label, and freeze at 0 degrees F up to 2 months. To  serve, defrost sauce 15 to 20 minutes in microwave oven on Defrost setting,  stirring several times, or thaw in refrigerator 8 to 24 hours. Gently warm  sauce in a saucepan or microwave oven on 50% power until warmed through,  about 3 minutes, whisking frequently and vigorously to bring it to a creamy  consistency.
