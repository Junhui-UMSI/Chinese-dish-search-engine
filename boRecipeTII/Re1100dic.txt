Corny Polenta
Nonfat Veg Chicken Broth;, Salt, Low Sodium Canned Corn; Or, Instant Polenta, 
Put the broth and salt into a large enough pot and bring to a boil. Let it  boil for 2 min then remove it from the flame, pour all the polenta in, then  stir to incorporate, put it back on the flame on med and stir constantly  for 5 - 6 minutes. About 1 minute before the end of the cooking time add  the corn.    This was extremely good!! I would make this again.
