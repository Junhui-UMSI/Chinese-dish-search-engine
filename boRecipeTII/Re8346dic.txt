She writes: There is one item my mother prepares  spectacularly well, one item for which she is lengendary. I begin dreaming  of it in the spring and beg for it every summer. It is potato salad. My  mothers is to die for.  Over the past four decades our family has  experienced its share of upheaval (sic)but no mater what has happened in  the prior year, my mothers brimming crockery bowl sits in its honorary  spot on the buffet, it is constant and comnforting...(end of quote)    Boil the potatoes until you can pierce them easily with a fork, then drain  completely and cool, cut into eights.(Dont cool them in the water or  theyll get mushy!") In a large bowl gently mix with eggs, celery,  pimento.Season with salt, pepper, onion powder to taste. In a separate  bowl, blend the mustard,Miracle Whip. Gently blend into the salad. Sprinkle  with paprika, cover tightly, refirgerate until serving.    EAT-L Digest 30 June 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
