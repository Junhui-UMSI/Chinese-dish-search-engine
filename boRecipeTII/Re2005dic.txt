I love baking with this flour......its pre-sifted, soft and easy to work  with.    I DO re-sift though........just to be sure!!!  <flushright>1. Cream marg. Gradually add sugar, creaming till light and  fluffy.  2. Sift flour with baking powder and salt.  3. Add eggs one at a time to creamed mixture, beating well after each  addition.  4. Add flour mixture alternately with pareve milk and flavorings, beating  after each    addition until smooth.  5. Pour batter into three greased and floured round 9 inch layer pans.  6. Bake at 350* F., for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pans 10 minutes.  NOTE: I made one huge sheet cake from this.........baked for 45 minutes, in  a huge    rectangular pan. Cake came out looking and smelling great!    To be frosted tomorrow, ready for Shabbat.(Use your favorite frosting  recipe......    remember, this is a big cake!)
