Grill or broil peppers until charred on all sides.  If using a broiler,  line a baking sheet with a large piece of aluminum foil, big enough to hang  over both ends of baking sheet.  Place peppers in a single layer on top of  foil.  Place about 6 inches below broiler element. Rotate to char all  sides.  Remove from oven and enclose in foil for 5 minutes. Open foil and  allow to rest until cool enough to handle. Remove skin, seeds and core.    To remove pits from olives, press with side of a large-bladed knife: this  will expose pit and it can be easily removed.  Or use a cherry pitter.    In a large bowl, combine all dressing ingredients and stir to combine. Add  all remaining ingredients except bread and garnish; toss.  Cover and  marinate for at least 1 hour.    Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Place bread in single layer on baking sheet or  jelly roll pan.  Bake until golden.  Cool.  Add bread to olive mixture and  toss.  Allow to sit for 10 minutes.  Line platter with mixed greens. Mound  olive salad in center.    Note:  Olive mixture (without bread and garnish), can be stored in an  airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
