Apples with Caramel Sauce
Tart apples, peeled, cored, Calvados (apple brandy; opt), Frozen apple juice, Unsalted butter, Sugar, Heavy cream, Vanilla, 
1. In 2-quart heavy saucepan melt sugar over low heat, watching  carefully so it doesnt burn.    2. In 2-cup glass measuring cup microwave heavy cream 30 seconds to 1  minute, or until it reaches about 140-160F.    3. When sugar has liquified and turned an amber color, slowly stir in  warm cream with a wooden spoon. Stir vigorously to avoid lumps. Stir  liquified sugar as it begins to turn amber color.    4. Stir in apple juice concentrate and vanilla. Cook over moderate  heat until thoroughly blended. Strain out any lumps that might remain.    5. Meanwhile, in heavy non-stick skillet saute apples in butter 2  minutes, or until heated through but still crisp. If desired, warm  Calvados, pour over apples and ignite. When flames subside, spoon  apples into serving dishes and top with warm caramel sauce.    From Tuscon area newspapers, 1994, 3rd quarter, courtest Mike Orchekowski.
