Here is a recipe from the St. Louis Post Dispatch which sounds a little  bland, but this can be fixed.  I apologize for the MIME problem with the  last transmission. Im just getting going. This is from the Februrary 1994  Chile Pepper magazine, p. 41. I havent tried it yet, but it won a 1st  prize in "The Great Chile Pepper Recipe Contest"          Sift all the dry ingredients together in a food processor.  Add the  shortening to the flour.  Cut the butter into chunks and add to the food  processor and process until it is cut into very tiny pieces, about 1  minutes. Add the water and continue to mix until the dough wraps itself  around the blade and forms a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic and  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Pastry can be kept in the refrigerator  for about a week or it can be frozen for several months. If frozen, defrost  slowly in a refrigerator before use.    Pie Filling:    Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.    Line a 9-inch pie pan with the chocolate pie pastry and set aside. Combine  the eggs, corn syrup, sugar, fudge mixture, and vanilla.  Stir in the  pecans and pour the mixture into pie shell. Bake for 15 minutes, then  reduce heat to 350 Degrees F and continue baking for another 30 minutes, of  until the edges are set.    Serve with chocolate ice cream for the ultimate chocolate experience!
