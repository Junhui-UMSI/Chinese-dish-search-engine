Place all ingredients, except for the flour, in a medium-sized bowl and mix  well. Using your hands, shape the mixture into 6 patties. Press firmly so  that the patties hold together well.    Dredge both sides of each patty in the flour and palce them on a well-oiled  cookie sheet.    Bake the patties at 400 deg for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden  brown. Turn the patties over halfway through the baking.    Serve them with the sauce of your choice, acompanied by a steamed vegetable  and a salad.
