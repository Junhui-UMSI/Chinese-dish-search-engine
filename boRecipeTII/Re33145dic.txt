Basic Kibbi
Pepper, Salt, Ground lamb, Onion, Allspice, Cinnamon, Bulgur, 
* Add an additional 1/2 cup when using lamb.    Cover bulgur with cold water, soak for 10 minutes. Drain and press between  palms of hand to remove excess water. Work onions and spices together with  fingers. Knead meat and spices together thoroughly; add crushed wheat and  continue kneading. Dip hands in ice water while kneading in order to soften  kibbi. (Ingredients must be kept cold.) Run the kneaded mixture through a  meat grinder one to three times for a finer consistency.    Note: When using beef, 1 1/4 teaspoon of ground sweet basil may be added.    Recipe by: Lebanese Cuisine, Madelain Farah    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by shade <liveoak@polaris.net> on Mar 14, 1998
