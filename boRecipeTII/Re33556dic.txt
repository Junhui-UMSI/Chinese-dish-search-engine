Add eggs, one at a time.  Alternately  add milk and flour mixture, beating after each addition. Add vanilla or  almond extract. Spoon into pans, level off, and push slightly toward sides  of pan. Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then  invert onto a rack and cool completely. Frost as you wish.    Variations:    Marzipan Cake: add 4 oz canned almond filling with the eggs, and top with a  thinly rolled layer of marzipan.    Orange Cake:  Add zest of 1 1/2 oranges and replace milk with fresh orange  juice, use orange extract instead of vanilla or almond.    I made this for my wedding reception last summer.  I ended up with this  recipe after trying out several that were too dry and crumbly.  Of course,  doing the taste-testing wasnt too bad either...
