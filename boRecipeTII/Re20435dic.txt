Vegan Pancakes
White flour, Applesauce, Egg substitute powder, Water, Water, Baking Powder, Sugar, Salt, 
Combine well the first 4 (dry) ingredients in a large bowl. In a second  bowl, mix the egg substitute with the 1/2 cup water.  Beat with a mixer on  high setting till it thickens somewhat - about 60-90 seconds.  This is the  egg substitute powder available in Whole Foods stores and other health-food  stores (does not contain any egg product). Warm-up the applesauce  (microwave works well for this) Combine the egg-substitute and applesauce  in the large bowl with the dry ingredients.  Now add enough additional  water (about 1 or 1.5 cup) until consistency is typical for batter. >From  this point on, cook in a pan or on griddle as with any other pancake  batter. Enjoy P.S.  Ive found that the egg-substitute really works great  as       long as it is beaten well with an electric mixer. Also, I try to  use applesauce frequently in baked stuff as a fat/oil replacement - it  actually seems to work okay in pancakes...    Recipe By     : gawilson@vnet.IBM.COM (Gale A.
