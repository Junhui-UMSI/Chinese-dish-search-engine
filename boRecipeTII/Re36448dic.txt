About a week before, make a starter from 2 bottles of Sierra Nevada Pale  Ale.  Use  about 4 tablespoons of plain light malt extract syrup  and  a  couple of hop pellets. Boil major ingredients, ala Complete Joy of Home  Brewing, in 2  gallons of water. (60 minute boil). Add 1/3 ounce Chinook  hops at start of boil, 1/3 ounce Chinnook at 30 minutes and 1/3 ounce of  Cascade hops  in  the last two minutes of the boil. Then combine with 3  gallons of  ice  cold tap water (which was boiled the previous night, and  cooled  in  the freezer) in a 7 gallon carboy. Ferment in primary for a  week.  Put  1/2 ounce of Cascade pellets in bottom of secondary and rack  beer  into secondary. Bottle three weeks later. This a report on my second  use of "maltose" (a cheap rice malt available from most Oriental Markets).  In the previous attempt ("Number 17",  see HBD #541 or The Cats Meow: p  36) there were a few problems. It was also my first attempt at culturing  yeast (from a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale), and for various reasons, it didnt  work very well. The other problem was  I used to much maltose, about 40%,  which made the result  a  little  too light. This time I decided to use  about 20% maltose, which IMHO, is just about right. Ive also since  perfected yeast culturing.  The result is a nice thirst quenching, summer  ale, which, with my favorite  pizza,  is heaven*2. Taste: Excellent!
