In  a small saucepan, combine the butter and syrup and cook the mixture over  moderately low heat, stirring, until the butter is melted. Pour the butter  mixture into the flour mixture and combine the batter well. Drop heaping  tablespoons of the batter 2 inches apart onto a buttered baking sheet and  flatten them slightly with the back of a fork dipped in water. Bake the  cookies in the middle of a preheated 300F degree oven for 15 minutes, or  until they are golden.  Let the cookies cool slightly on the baking sheet,  transfer them with a spatula to a rack and let them cool completely.
