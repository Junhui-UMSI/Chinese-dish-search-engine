The Palace Cafe, located on New Orleans Canal Street in the old Werleins  Building, is the newest restaurant from the Brennan family, who also  operate some of the Citys finest restaurants: Commanders Palace, Mr. Bs  Bistro and Bacco. This dessert has become extremely popular, and has  practically become The Palace Cafes signature dessert.    You will absolutely slay your guests if you make this. Ive had dinner  guests describe this dessert as "orgasmic", and "the best dessert Ive ever  had".    Heat the cream in a double boiler and add the white chocolate; when the  chocolate is melted, remove from heat.    In a double boiler, heat the milk, sugar, eggs and egg yolks until warm.  Blend the egg mixture into the cream and chocolate mixture.    Place the bread slices in a baking pan. Pour 1/2 of the mixture over the  bread and let settle for a while, making sure the bread soaks up all the  mixture. Top with the rest of the mixture. Cover with aluminum foil and  bake at 275 degrees for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for an additional  15 minutes until the top is golden brown.    For the sauce: Gently melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. Remove  from heat and mix in heavy cream. Spoon over bread pudding. Serves 8.
