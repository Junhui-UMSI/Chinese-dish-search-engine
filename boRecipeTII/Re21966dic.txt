Do not use cans or other jars that may not be  appropriate for this method due to lead content. Or, use a special crockpot  baking pan available thruough Rival Co. To assure that baked cakes will  slip out easily, grease inside of jars well. (Lining bottom of jars with  waxed paper also will help.) Cover each jar with a piece of foil greased on  one side. Place greased side down and press foil around edges to seal  tightly. Place jars in crockpot with crockery liner in place.

Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes. Unmold cakes; remove waxed paper.  Serve warm or cool with whipped topping, if desired.
