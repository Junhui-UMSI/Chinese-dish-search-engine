Havent heard of the song "Here we go round the Lamington Plate". Is it in  tune to "Here we go round the mulberry bush"? My daughter has read the book  "Possum Magic" and she loves it too. Shes 10 and has liked that for years  too.    Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. beat in eggs one at a time,  beating well between each addition. Fold in sifted flour alternately with  combined milk and vanilla. Pour mixture into a greased 18 x 28 cm lamington  tin. Bake at 180 centigrade (this equals 350 fahrenheit) for 30 to 40  minutes. Turn onto a cake rack to cool.    Make the cake a day or two before cutting and icing the lamingtons, as  fresh cake will usually crumble (the recipe says, not me!) Cut the cake  into 5cm (2") squares.    ICING: Pour boiling water over butter, add cocoa and mix well. Beat in  icing sugar until mixture is smooth. Using a long pronged fork, dip each  piece of cake into chocolate icing and then roll in coconut. Leave to set  on a cake rack.
