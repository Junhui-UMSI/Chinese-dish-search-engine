Veal Scaloppine Marsala
Veal cutlet, Butter, Chopped parsley, sweet Marsala wine, Flour, Mushrooms, 
1.  Pound the veal with a mallet to break down the veins and make it even  and thin. Dip each slice in the flour. Pat between hands to remove excess  flour.    2.  Melt the butter over medium heat in a skillet, taking care not to burn  it. When butter sizzles, saute the veal slices 1 to 2 minutes until juices  show on top of the meat.    3.  Using a spatula and spoon, turn the veal slices.  Add the mushrooms.  Saute the veal 1 or 2 minutes more, until lightly browned on the edges. Do  not overcook.    4.  Add the wine.  Tilt the pan and hold the veal and mushrooms on the high  side with the spatula so veal is away from heat and wine mixture is near  heat. Shake the pan to flame the wine (use a match if stove is electric).    5. Simmer about 3 minutes or until syrupy, occasionally dipping the pan to  flavor the veal with the sauce.    6.  Place the veal on a heated serving platter.  Pour the sauce over &  sprinkle with parsley.  Serve immediately.    NOTE:  The veal can be prepared in advance step    1.  Cooking must be done at the last min. It is important to pound the veal  so it is of uniform thickness, and therefore will cook evenly.
