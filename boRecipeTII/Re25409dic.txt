Tortilla De Patatas (Potato Omelet) - Aka Frittata
Red potatoes, Milk, Garlic, olive oil, Mushrooms, Oregano, Onion, Eggs, Cheddar cheese, Ham, Baking Powder, 
Brown potatoes in olive oil. Drain. Whip egg yolks a little bit, add all  other ingredients except egg whites. Mix thoroughly. Beat egg whites until  about double in volume (a foamy liquid) . Fold egg whites gently into rest  of mixture. Pour into a buttered, pre-heated omelet pan. Cook gently until  almost set. Keep sliding the pan back and forth so that the omelet doesnt  stick. Remove pan from stovetop. Place under pre-heated broiler. Cook until  top is browned to your liking. Remove from oven, slide omelet onto plate  and eat.    Notes: This is a Spanish dish. Note that in Spain (also in Venezuela) a  tortilla is an egg dish, not like a Mexican tortilla. Use only as much  olive oil as needed to brown the potatoes.
