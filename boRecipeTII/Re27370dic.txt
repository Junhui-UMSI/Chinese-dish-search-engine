Toasted Couscous Vite Vite
Medium-size couscous, Boiling water, 
(authors notes): Regular couscous has a pasta-like flavor, while this  method gives the grains a nutty and smoky flavor which I prefer. I offer it  because it is so different. If you want to make regular couscous, simply  follow the instructions on the package. For this recipe the ratio of  couscous to water is always 1:1.5, so you can make any amount you want.    Toast the couscous over a low flame in a medium-weight frying pan without  oil or shortening, stirring or shaking vigorously so the granules dont  stick to the bottom. When you smell the rich flavor of the semolina, now  slightly darkened and tanned, drop the contents into a deep, covered  casserole dish. Add the boiling water immediately. Cover and let the  couscous steam for ten minutes. (Warning: do not lift the top of the  casserole dish for a peek, as this seemingly innocuous action will make for  lumpy couscous.)    After 10 minutes remove the cover from the casserole dish, and then fluff  the couscous with a wooden fork or chopsticks. Serve hot under the "face"  of the stew in the above recipe.
