I also  used apricot jam - the chunks of apricot in the jam added a nice texture.  The results were great!     Best to have all ingredients at room temperature.  Cream butter and sugar.  Add egg, lemon zest, banana and apricot butter.  Sift flour and baking  powder together. Fold flour mixture gradually into the wet ingredients. Mix  in walnuts. Pour batter into a bread pan, and bake for about 1 hour at 350  degrees Farenheit.    P.S. Apricot butter also makes a nice glaze for pork roast or ham.
