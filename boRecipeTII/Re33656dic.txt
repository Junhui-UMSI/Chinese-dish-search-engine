Swedish Vanilla Cookies
CHOCOLATE GLAZE (OPTIONAL, Butter or margarine, All-Purpose Flour, Corn syrup, (6-oz) semisweet chocolate, Finely chopped nuts, Egg yolk, Currant jelly, Butter or margarine, Vanilla extract, 
Cookies: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Work butter in a bowl until creamy. Add  sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk and vanilla and beat  well. Add sifted flour to butter mixture gradually and mix until smooth.  Divide dough into small balls about 3/4-inch in diameter. Place balls about  2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Flatten slightly with the  fingers and make a depression in each with the thumb. Bake 15 minutes, or  until lightly browned. Cool on wire cake racks. Fill depressions with  currant jelly. Cookies may be stored unfilled and the jelly added when  ready to serve. If desire, part of the dough may be shaped into cylinders  about 2 inches by 1/2 inch and baked 15 minutes. When cylinder-shaped  cookies are cool, dip one half of each cookie in the Chocolate Glaze and  roll in chopped nuts. Makes 5-6 dozen cookies.     Chocolate Glaze: Melt chocolate in a small saucepan directly over low heat  (about 175 degrees). Stir in the butter and corn syrup and mix thoroughly.
