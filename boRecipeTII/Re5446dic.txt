Pineapple Corn Bread
Baking Powder, Yellow corn meal, crushed pineapple, Flour, Salt, shortening, Eggs, milk, Pineapple juice, 
This came out of my Grandmothers old Rumford Calcium Phosphate (Baking  Powder) book. It is my understanding that the book may be reissued-there  are many recipes that our family loves and enjoys-this one.    Sift flour, Baking Powder, salt amd corn meal together. Combine beaten  eggs, milk, pineapple juice, pineapple and shortening and pour into dry  ingredients, stirring only until moistened. Pour into a greased loaf pan  (8x4x21/2) and bake in a moderately hot oven. 375 for 1 hour. We spray a  glass baking dish and make a flatter cornbread that cuts into squares.
