Veggie Red Beans and Rice

I just take a regular recipe and leave out the sausage. Ill add a couple  chipotles or four to add in a smoky flavour, but if thats too spicy for  you, then leave them out.     Put the beans in a big pot, add 2 quarts water and salt and bring to a  boil.  Reduce the heat and and simmer, skimming occasionally, for 45  minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and continue cooking until beans  are tender and liquid is thick. (Red beans and rice is supposed to be  creamy and to get this effect, you should take a potato masher or something  and smash down on about 1/3 of the beans). Serve over white rice.
