Khasa Baigan Bhaji (Eggplant-Cheese Fritters)
Fresh chopped coriander;, Water, Mozzarella; thinly sliced, Fresh or dry breadcrumbs, Vegetable oil or _ghee_ for, Cloves garlic; sliced,, Chickpea flour plus 3 tbsp, Cornmeal, Cayenne or paprika to taste, Turmeric, Salt, Or 2 smaller eggplants;, 
Salting time: 30 min. Prep and cooking: 30 min. Serves 4 to 6    Sprinkle eggplant slices liberally with salt and set aside 1/2 hr. for  excess water to drain off.    Combine flours, cornmeal, spices, herbs and salt with the water in a bowl  and whisk till smooth and the consistency of thick cream, adding water if  needed.    Rinse salt off eggplant and pat dry with paper towels. Pair up slices about  the same size. Trim cheese slices a tad smaller than eggplant rounds (a  biscuit or cookie cutter is handy.) Place 2 slices of cheese between each  pair of eggplant slices. Dip each sandwich in batter, lightly shake off  excess, dip in breadcrumbs & set aside (waxed paper is helpful). Make all  the sandwiches before beginning to fry.    Heat 1/2" oil or _ghee_ in a large skillet till hot but not smoking. If  desired, place garlic slices in the oil till it is very fragrant, then  remove them. Fry fritters 10-15 min. on each side till eggplant is  fork-tender. Drain and serve. I like this kind of thing with coleslaw or  tater salad if Im not feeling like making something authentic. You can  also top them with marinara sauce.    NOTE: The only slightly tricky thing about this dish is the heat; too hot  and the cheese leaks, but it has to be fairly hot to keep the fritters from  coming out oily. Just watch for beginnings of leakage.
