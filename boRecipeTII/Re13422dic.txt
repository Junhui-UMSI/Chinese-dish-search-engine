Add salt, sugar, and shortening to water  or potato water. Add 2 cups flour; beat thoroughly. Add yeast and eggs,  mixing well. Add the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead on a  lightly floured board until shiny. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover  with a tea towel, and let stand in a warm place until the dough has doubled  in bulk. Punch down the dough and turn it over. Cover with a tea towel.  Chill in the refrigerator overnight.    Divide the dough into balls the size of a small apple.  Roll out to rounds  1/4 inch thick.  Place a tablespon of filling in the center of each round.  Bring three sides of the circle together at the center to form a triangle.  Pinch edges together to form a slight ridge.  Let stand at room temperature  until doubled in bulk.  Brush tops with an egg yolk diluted with 1  tablespoon water. Place very far apart on greased baking tins and bake at  350F until golden brown (about 35 minutes). Makes 15 very large  Hamentaschen.
