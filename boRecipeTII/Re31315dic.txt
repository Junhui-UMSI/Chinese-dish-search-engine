Crumble the feta cheese, and mixe well with the spinach. (mother adds also  parsley) Place one sheet of filo in a round cake pan, brush with butter,  cover with another sheet, and repeat the procedure 3-4 times. Then spread  evenly 1/4 of spinach-cheese mixture, cover with 2 more greased filo, and  repeat. The top should be covered with 2-3 sheets of filo. Bake for about  20-30 minutes to a nice golden brown crust.    Serve hot with plain yogurt.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Viviane & Israel Barzel"  <i_barzel@netvision.net.il> on May 11, 1998
