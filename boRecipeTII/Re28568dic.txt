Tex-Mex Rib Rub-Rib Rub W/mexican Influe
Black pepper, Cayenne, Garlic powder, Onion powder, Chili powder, achiote seeds, Dry mustard, Brown sugar, Sweet paprika, Ground cumin, 
A couple of folks have asked about my mention of an achiote rub for chicken  for green chile/chicken sandwiches. I cant for the life of me find the  recipe Ive used in the past, but this one looks good. Its from Babs  Woods, who may be on this list; I cant remember. As usual, chile-heads  adjust heat as endorphin addiction dictates:    Use on about 2 lbs meat.  (Recipe can be doubled, for 4 lbs. of meat or  ribs.)  Bake, roast, grill, whatever, until meat is properly cooked.  Store  dry rub in screwtop jar until use.
