Peanut Butter Candy
Butter;softened, 10x sugar, JONI CLOUD SSMW41A, Peanut butter, Milk Chocolate Coating, 
Mix all ingreds until smooth and soft, If sticky add more powdered sugar.  Make into small logs, egg shape. Melt chocolate coating. I use electric fry  pan with water on low, and I use a stainless steel bowl to melt  choc-coating. It gives me more room for dipping eggs. You can also just put  them in Reeses type molds, and papers. But we shape them in Egg shape for  Easter. Put on Wax paper lined cookie sheet and put in freezer for a few  minutes, makes them shiny and nice. PS. I use the left over chocolate to  make solid chocolate bunny-you can buy all kinds of molds that are in  expensive.    Or for my Jim add nuts and raisens, and put them in papers. They are just  like a chunky bar. Or just save it in a jar for next time. the kids always  like chocolate covered small pretzils. Use your imagination. <G> Good Luck  and Enjoy By Joni in S.Jersey
