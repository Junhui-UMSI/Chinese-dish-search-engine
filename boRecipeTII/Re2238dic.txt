Oven Temp: 350F / 180F / Gas mark 4  Preheat oven.  Toast sunflower seeds in oil in a skillet until golden,  and season with a sprinkle of salt.   Boil macaroni for half the required  time. (For small shells about 3 minutes.) Macaroni should still have a  definite chew to it, because it will continue to cook in the oven.   Saute  onions until light golden in color and add mushrooms, saute another 4  minutes. Stir all ingredients together well and spoon into a greased baking  dish.   Bake for 20 minutes and cover with breadcrumbs. Bake another 10  minutes and garnish with raw green bell pepper or parsley.
