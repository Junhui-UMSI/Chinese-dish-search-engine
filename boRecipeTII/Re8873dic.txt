Fry for 10 mins or until the onions  become translucent and just start to turn brown. Dont leave it alone, it  needs regular stirring. Add the Balti masala paste, tomatoes and tomato  puree, mix well. Add the peppers and chillies, raise the heat, it should  sizzle zway nicely, then put the prawns into the delightful smelling  mixture. Stir-fry for 5 mins or so. Add Balti garam masala, paprika and a  little salt, add small quantities of water to stop it all from sticking.  Continue to stir-fry for another 5 mins or until the prawns are done. Be  careful not to add too much water as the dish should be quite dry. Serve  sizzling, garnished with the fresh coriander. Eat with naan bread and/or  rice. Yum.
