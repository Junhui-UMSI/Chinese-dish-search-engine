Beef Jerky a la Willie
Lo salt soy sauce, Onion powder, Garlic powder, * use in place of smoker., Brown sugar, Liquid mesquite smoke *, Lean beef, Worcestershire Sauce, Pepper, 
Mix all ingredients except beef to make marinade.  Cut thinly sliced beef  into 1/2 inch strips and marinate for 8 to 12 hours. Smoke using mesquite  chips for about three hours and then finish drying in oven. If doing whole  operation in oven use liquid smoke and hang strips of beef on highest rack  and put shallow pan underneath to catch drippings. Turn oven on and set to  lowest possible setting and leave for 6 to 8 hours until thoroughly dried.  A couple of hints that I picked up from one of the cooking echoes. Use  toothpicks or wooden skewers to hang meat by, and put a couple of layers of  paper towels in the pan to collect the drippings and save cleaning problems  later on.
