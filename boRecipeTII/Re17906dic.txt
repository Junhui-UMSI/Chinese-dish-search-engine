Alsatian Onion Pie
Onions, Unbleached flour, Wholewheat pie shell, Oil (Canola oil), Firm tofu, Black pepper, Soy milk, Couscous, Nutmeg, Sea salt, 
Saute onions in oil (I added 1/2 cup water to prevent burning, or you could  substitute water for the oil to reduce fat), until translucent and mostly  soft. Blend the soy milk, tofu, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and flour until  smooth. Then combine the onions, the soy milk mixture and the couscous.  Pour into the prepared pie shell. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F  for about 30 minutes.    >From: Lindsey Jones Date: 10-27-93  Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by brightl@kitmailbox.com on 19979Sep,
