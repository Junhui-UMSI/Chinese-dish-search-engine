Pork Rillette
Chicken Stock, Butter softened optional, Grated nutmeg, Salt and pepper, Butter, Chopped parsley, Powdered mace, Mined onion, Leftover chopped roast pork, 
Put roast pork, parsley, nutmeg, stock, onion, mace, salt and pepper in a  heavy pot, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes to heat through and blend  flavors. Pour contents of the pot into the bowl of your food processor and  process - using a pulsing action. Do not puree. If the pork roast had a  fair amount of fat, the butter may not be necessary - use your own  judgment. If butter seems needed because the pork is very lean, stir in the  softened butter at this point. Pour into 3-4 small crocks. Refrigerate to  cool. Melt butter and pour a thin layer over the top of rillette in each  crock. Refrigerate until butter sets.
