Recipe by: Houston Chronicle, May, 1997    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour a 13-by-9-by-2-inch baking  pan. Sift flour with baking powder. In large bowl with clean beaters, beat  egg whites until frothy. Add sugar gradually, beating to form stiff peaks.  Add yolks, 1 at a time. Slowly add flour and milk. Pour batter into  prepared pan and bake until edges are golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes,    Remove from oven and let cool on a rack. Topping: Combine milks and sour  cream (do not beat). Pour Topping over cake and let sit until all the  mixture is absorbed, 20 to 30 minutes.    Prepare Meringue and refrigerate:   Combine sugar and water in a saucepan.  Let sit until sugar is dissolved. In clean electric mixer bowl with clean  beaters, beat egg whites. Slowly pour sugar syrup over egg whites, beating  constantly until meringue holds stiff peaks. Store in refrigerator. This  can be served immediately but is best made 24 hours ahead and chilled. The  meringue will keep, covered, 2 days in the refrigerator.    Before serving, cut cake into squares and spread Meringue over each.  Garnish as desired with fresh berries and mint leaves.    "This dessert is a favorite on the menus at many Houston Mexican and South  American restaurants.
