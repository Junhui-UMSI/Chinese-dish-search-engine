Fruit-Rice Pudding
Frozen orange juice, Cooked brown rice, Crushed pineapple in its own, Raisins, Banana; peeled and chopped, Hot water, Vanilla extract, 
Well, anyway...someone requested a recipe for rice pudding a couple of days  ago and it just so happens that I have a couple. These are both from _The  New McDougall Cookbook_.    Preheat the oven to 350? F.    Mix the rice, pineapple, and raisins in a bowl.    Put the remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor and process  until smooth. Add to the rice mixture and mix well.    Pour into a 3-quart casserole. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, or until set.  Serve hot.    Posted to fatfree digest by "K. N.
