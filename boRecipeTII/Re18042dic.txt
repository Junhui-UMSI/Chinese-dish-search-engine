You may want to start out  with a very small amount of jalapenos and then let mixture sit for 20 or 30  minutes for the flavors to blend and the "heat" to develop before adding  more.

"Sandwich" the garnish in between and cut in half.    Digest eat-lf.v096.n122    From the EAT-LF recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
