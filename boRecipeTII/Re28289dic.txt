Baked Garlic Quail
Brown sugar, Honey, Garlic, Quail, Light soy sauce, Sambal oelek, Vegetable oil, 
Wish I could show you all the picture of this dish. The quail are a  gorgeous deep reddish orange in color. I imagine that this would be a great  recipe to use on chicken wings. And theyd definitely be hot++ check out  the amount of sambal oelek, the Indonesian condiment made of crushed birds  eye chilies, garlic and vinegar. Im making this tomorrow with a hacked up  chicken and a double recipe of the marinade. Ill start marinating it  tonight. It would probably be great with a game hen as well. Stay tuned++a  report will follow.    1: Cut quail in half through centres. Combine garlic, sambal oelek, honey,  sauce, sugar and oil in bowl, add quail, stir well; cover, refrigerate  overnight.    2: Just before serving, place quail on rack over baking dish, bake in  moderate oven for 15 minutes, increase temperature to hot, cook further 10  minutes or until quail are crisp and tender.    Makes 4 servings.    Quail can be prepared 2 days ahead.    Storage: Covered, in refrigerator. Freeze: Uncooked quail suitable.  Microwave: Not suitable.
