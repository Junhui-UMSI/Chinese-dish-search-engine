Hi JB...so, you do not like tofu..perhaps you have never had it done right;  here is a recipe I devised for Curried Tofu. PLEASE try it and let me know  if your taste buds are still negative.    First weight the tofu for about half an hour to remove excess water, and  then cut it into 1" squares(approx)and let these sit and dry some more  while you finely chop the onion...use a big onion. Mince the garlics, and  finely chop the ginger, and the hab(use mittens, or be prepared to face the  consequence) In a wok, quickly stir fry the tofu pieces,using peanut oil,  in batches over high heat, until it is all a little browned, then set it  aside to get rid of the excess oil and any more moisture. In a pan or pot,  stainless is good, place about 2 tbls of peanut oil on low heat and dump in  the onion, garlic, ginger, and minced hab. Let this simmer over low to  medium heat, and add the curry powder, and salt to taste. Cover this and  let it go for awhile on LOW...do not let it burn. The secret to a good  curry, either vegetable or animal, is long slow cooking of the onion curry  mixture. Now you can stir in the reserved tofu, raise the heat to medium  high and add the can of coconut milk. Do not cover, but let this simmer  until reduced quite a bit...taste for seasoning, add a little sugar and  more salt to taste.    Serve this with Thai rice, or any good long grain rice.Great veggie food!    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Oct  10, 1998,
