Vanilla Cloud
Deep; hard bean, Colorado, Skim milk, Vanilla flavoring, Equal; (tm), Cinnamon, Chilled Brazilian beans, 
Begin by preparing a latte as normal, but before steaming the milk, do  this: mix half skim milk and half vanilla flavoring until completely  blended. Add half of a packet of Equal (tm) to this and then steam. Pour  liquid into espresso and then put the thick foam on top. Garnish with a  dash of cinnamon.
