Combine the bananas, rum, lime juice, and sugar in a bowl and stir gently  to combine. Let marinate for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally.      Meanwhile, prepare the batter.      Blender:      To make it in a blender, combine all the batter ingredients and blend at  high speed for a few seconds. Turn off the machine and scrape down the  sides, and blend again at high speed for 30 to 40 seconds.      By hand:      To make the batter by hand, combine the egg and milk in a deep bowl and  gradually stir in the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Beat with a  whisk or electric beater until the flour lumps disappear. Pour the batter  into a mixing bowl.       Fill a deep fryer or large heavy saucepan with oil to a depth of 2 or 3  inches (5 to 7 cm) and heat the oil to a temperature of 375F (190C) on a  deep-frying thermometer.      Drain the banana slices and pat them dry with paper towels. Dip 4 or 5  slices at a time into the batter, coating them well, and transfer them  CAREFULLY with a slotted spoon to the hot oil. Fry a few at a time for 3 to  5 minutes, turning them with a spoon until they are deep brown on both  sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Mound on a heated platter and  serve immediately.      Serves 4 to 6.    Source: www.wwrecipes.com MMed by: ecravens@hdo.net    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Earl Cravens <ecravens@hdo.net> on Aug 07,  1998
