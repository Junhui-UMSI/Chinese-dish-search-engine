Huacatay Sauce (Salsa De Huacatay)
Huacatay, Salt; vinegar and oil, Fresh chili mirasol, 
Here are the recipes I have. They are from Comidas criollas peruanas  (Peruvian Creole Food Cookbook). These are the translations in the cookbook  (it is in Spanish and English):    Grate the chili with a few of the well washed huacatay leaves, adding a  little salt. Put this onto a plate and soften it with a little oil and  vinegar. For meat, potatoes or fish.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by SN Janin <snjanin@anguillanet.com> on Nov  16, 1998,
