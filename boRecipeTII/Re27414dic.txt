Toasted Tomato, Onion and Cheese Sandwiches
See instructions, 
Make sandwiches with two slices of bread (store supplied bread is ok) with  tomato and onion slices. Season with salt, pepper or seasoning of your  taste, and sprinkle some cheese over. Fasten a piece of string around the  sandwich like you will do with a parcel (this is to keep the slices of  onion and tomato from falling out) and toast this till lightly browned over  the coals. Remove the string before serving.    Posted to rec.food.recipes by japlady@nwu.edu (Rebecca Radnor) on 1995, .
