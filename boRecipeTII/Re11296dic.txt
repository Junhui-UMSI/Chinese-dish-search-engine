Ramrod Biscuits for Camping
Nonfat dry milk, Honey, Water, Biscuit mix, Jelly, 
* Have a good campfire going before mixing these biscuits. Also have some  smooth dry sticks about 3/4 inch in diameter ready. Be careful to know what  kind of wood is safe -- NEVER use Oleander wood.    Mix the biscuit mix (such as Bisquick) and dry milk together and take  camping in a plastic baggie or in a bowl with lid so that you can just make  the biscuits in the same container. Take along some honey or jelly for  eating with this. Mix only enough of the water into the dry ingredients to  make a stiff dough. Divide into 6 portions and shape dough around the end  of each stick. Roast over the fire until golden brown. Remove from stick  and fill with honey or jelly if desired.
