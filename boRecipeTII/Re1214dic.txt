Crock-O-Peas
Dry black eyed peas, Onion, Hamhock, Water, Salt to taste, Black pepper, 
This is a time honored crockpot recipe for black-eyed peas. The meat is  optional and dieters will find it tastes just fine without the ham-hock, or  with just a few cubes of ham.  A virtually meatfree ham-bone will do also.  Spam lovers can use chunks of spam.    Put the beans in the crockpot, and add the rest of the dry ingredients. The  salt and black pepper amounts will vary with your desires, but I normally  start with a tablespoon of each.    Cook on low for 12 hours.  Serve as a side dish, or as a min dish over  rice. Keeps well in a crockpot for up to 2 days.    For gravy, take 1/2 cup of the liquid, and 1/2 cup of the beans, and  smoothe in a blender.  Add more beans if not thick enough for your desires,  Use on rice, potatoes, and meats.    From the kitchen of: xxcarol    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Nov 08, 98
