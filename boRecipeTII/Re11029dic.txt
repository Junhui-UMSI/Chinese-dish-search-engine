The white sauce is a pretty quick fix. This can be assembled like a  lasagna, but I like to get it into the oven with a bit less fuss. Serve  with a big green salad. Serves 4 or 5.    (cheeses are optional)**    1.Make the white sauce while cooking off the pasta.    2.White sauce: Melt the butter and stir in the flour. Add the garlic and  stir until the garlic begins to brown.    3.Gradually whisk in the milk, making sure it is always smooth. Stir in  salt and pepper to taste and gently simmer for about 5 minutes. Fish out  the garlic, mash it, and stir it back in.    4.Drain the pasta and toss with the ragu. Put it in a baking dish. Pour the  white sauce over the top and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake until brown  and bubbly. Serve with parmesan cheese.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by GAdams1350 <GAdams1350@aol.com> on Apr 5,  1998
