Add butter, and cut into flour mixture  with a pastry cutter. Beat eggs and milk to blend, and set aside 2  Tablespoons of egg-milk mixture. Add remainder to flour mixture, and stir  until just evenly moistened. Scrape dough onto a floured board or surface  and knead about 6 turns or until dough holds together. Divide dough in  half. Pat each half into a 3/4 inch thick round, 5-6 inches in diameter.  Set rounds well apart on an oiled 12 x 15 inch baking sheet. With a knife,  cut each round not quite through, to form 6 equal wedges. Brush rounds with  reserved egg-milk mixture. Bake in a 400F oven until golden brown, about 18  minutes. Serve hot or warm, breaking along scores.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
