Ravioli Dolce Stuffed W/nutella
Salt, Sugar, Nutella, Unsalted butter, Lemon Peel, Potato starch, Brandy, Flour, Vanilla, Egg, 
In medium bowl, combine flour, potato starch and salt.    Cream together butter and sugar. Add egg, brandy, lemon peel and  vanilla; beat until light and fluffy.    Gradually add dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Wrap dough  in plastic and refrigerate several hours.    Roll out half the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch  thick. Cut dough into 2 inch squares and place on buttered cookie  sheets. Top with a tsp of Nutella. Avoid getting Nutella on edges of  cookies. Refrigerate cookie sheets 15 min.    Roll out remaining dough and cut into 2 inch squares. Brush edges with  water. Remove cookie sheets from refrigerator and top each square  with a plain one. Press edges with fork to seal. Bake immediately in  a 350 deg oven for 15 min. or until cookies begin to brown. Cool and  sprinkle with confectioners sugar. Makes about 2 dozen.    Jam can be substituted for the Nutella (but who would want to?!)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
