Potato Salad with Tomatillo Sauce
Radishes, vegetable oil, Juice and Grated Zest of 1 Lime, New red-skinned potatoes, Plump tomatillos, Fresh cilantro, Jalapeno peppers, Garlic, Salt, Onion, Eggs, Cilantro leaves, 
1. If the skins on the potatoes look fresh, leave them on. Otherwise, peel  the potatoes and then slice them into rounds about 1/4 inch thick. Steam  them in a vegetable steamer until they are tender but still firm.    2. While they are steaming, make the sauce: Slice the jalapenos in half and  take out the seeds. Cut the onion into several large pieces. Bring a few  cups of water to a boil and add the tomatillos, jalapenos, onion and  garlic. Simmer until the tomatillos turn from bright green to dull, 10 to  15 minutes; then drain. Transfer vegetables to a food processor or blender,  add the cilantro, and puree. Stir in the optional oil, lime zest and juice.  Season with salt to taste.    3. Arrange the potatoes on a platter or in a shallow bowl. Slice the eggs  and intersperse them with the potatoes. Ladle the sauce over all. Garnish  with the radishes and cilantro sprigs.    Suggestion: For a hotter sauce, reserve half the garlic and jalapenos, then  add them, uncooked, to the tomatillos as they are being pureed.    From "The Savory Way," by Deborah Madison.
