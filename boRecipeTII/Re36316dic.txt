Heat oil up in wok until smoking. Stir fry beef quickly in it for  no longer than 3 minutes. Remove beef to a platter. Reserve. (If beef  is allowed to remain cooking in wok with other ingredients, it will  become hard and tough.)    3. Add green peppers and tomatoes to wok. Add sugar, cook tomatoes  down until juice forms in bottom of wok (about 3-5 minutes cooking  time).    4. Add beef back into wok. Stir all ingredients up so that it is  mixed. Add corn starch solution, cook 1 minute. Shut burner off,  serve dish immediately.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cc-wok.zip
