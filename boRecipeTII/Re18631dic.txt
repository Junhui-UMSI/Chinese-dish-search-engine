Recipe by: Gad S. Sheaffer (gss@iil.intel.com) This recipe is common to the  Ethiopian Jews (Phalashi). My understanding is that these are NOT unique to  them.    Peel all vegetables , cut into small cubes. peel and mash the garlic.    Heat oil in a large pan and add vegetables. cover and saute 2-3 minutes.    Add the ginger, turmeric, pepper and salt and mix well.    Add the water , stir and cook over very low flame for 30-40 minutes.    Serve hot.
