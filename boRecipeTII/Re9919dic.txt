Comments (mine):     -anyone familiar with Gephardt chili powder?     -I would use Anaheims for the "california pepper"     -surely fresh peppers are better than reconstitued!     -why not put a tabasco and a dash of vinegar instead of McIlhennys sauce?    a754458@snoopy.mc.ti.com (Scott Sehlhorst)    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
