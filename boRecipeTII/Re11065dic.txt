Rainbow Ribbon Mold
Boiling water, Jell-o brand gelatin, 
STIR 1 1/4 cups boiling water into 1 flavor of gelatin in small bowl at  least 2 minutes until completely dissolved. Pour 1/4 cup of the dissolved  gelatin into 6-cup ring mold. Refrigerate about 15 minutes until set but  not firm (gelatin should stick to finger when touched and should mound).  Refrigerate remaining gelatin in bowl about 5 minutes until slightly  thickened (consistency of unbeaten egg whites). Gradually stir in 3  tablespoons of the sour cream. Spoon over gelatin in pan. Refrigerate about  15 minutes or until set but not firm (gelatin should stick to finger when  touched and should mound).    MEANWHILE, repeat process with each remaining gelatin flavor. (Be sure to  cool dissolved gelatin to room temperature before pouring into mold.)  Refrigerate gelatin as directed to create a total of 10 alternating clear  and creamy gelatin layers.    REFRIGERATE 2 hours or until firm. Unmold. Garnish as desired.    Happily scanned and "Busted" by Pamela Creeden April 16, 1998    NOTES : Gelatin recipes with layers of different flavors and textures date  back to the early 1900s when they were called Neapolitans.  They were  often molded in loaf pans and served in slices to show the rainbow effect.  A real showpiece for a buffet or dinner party.  Recipe by: Jello?
