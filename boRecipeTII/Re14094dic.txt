Coarsely chopped white, Firmly packed dark brown, Unsalted butter, at room, Plus 2 tbsp flour, sifted, 
FROM:      DEREK MADDOX    One of our familys favorite cookies is shortbread. Its easy to make, and  VERY easy to eat.  This recipe also includes white chocolate -- what more  could you ask for. I was going to make this shortbread tonight, but  discovered that someone has eaten all my white chocolate! I havent  determined the culprit yet, but my 7-year old son is my number one suspect!    1. Preheat oven to 400 deg F.  Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan (or your  favorite shortbread mold).  Using a food processor fitted with a metal  blade, chop the white chocolate using on-off pulses, until it resembles  coarse meal.    2. Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, cream the butter with the  sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the flour. Stir in the chopped  white chocolate.    3. Pat the dough evenly into the prepared pan. Using the tip of a sharp  knife, score the dough into eight equal triangles.    4. Bake the shortbread until light golden in color, about 30 minutes.  Transfer in the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly. Remove the shortbread  from the pan and cool completely on the wire rack. Store in an airtight  container at room temperature.
