Place spareribs in large pot, cover with water, add splash of brandy (or  other liquor) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, simmer 45 to 60  minutes - until tender; drain well and cool slightly.    Combine garlic, marjoram, prepared mustard, salt, pepper and rub over ribs.  Arrange on platter, cover and let marinate in refrigerator up to 24 hours.    Bring all glaze ingredients to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer gently ,  stirring often, for 15 minutes, let cool. Refrigerate until ready to cook.    Let ribs and glaze stand at room temperature a half hour before cooking.  Place ribs on greased grill over low heat; cook until crisp, turning every  10 to 15 minutes and brushing with glaze during the last 15 minutes; 30-45  minutes in all.    Or brush ribs with glaze and bake in medium oven, basting occasionally  until they begin to crisp around the edges.
