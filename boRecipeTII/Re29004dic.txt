From: ldanehy@nmsu.edu (Lisa M. Danehy)    Date: 23 Dec 1993 04:22:59 GMT  This is a recipe that I found in Southern Living, and I think it was  reeaallyy good!    Unfold the pie crusts, one at a time, place on a lightly floured surface  and roll each into a 10inch square. Cut each square into 1inch strips.  Starting at the bottom of the pear, begin wrapping the pastry strips  carefully around the pear. Overlap the strips by about 1/4 of an inch as  you cover the pear. Continue wrapping by moistening ends of the strips  until the pear is completely covered. Repeat with each of the pears. Place  pears on a baking sheet. Combine eggyolk and water; brush evenly on pastry.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour or until tender. Spoon 3-4 TBS of Caramel Sauce onto  each dessert plate; top with a pear. Serves 5-6.    Caramel Sauce: Combine caramel and condensed milk in a double boiler, bring  water to boil reduce heat to low and cook until smooth, Stirring  consistantly. Stir in lemon juice and Cointreau.
