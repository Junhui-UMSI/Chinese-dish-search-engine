Remove skin and fat from chicken. While onion is cooking, mix ginger and  cinnamon and sprinkle on chicken pieces.    3. When onion is finished, place chicken in the pot, and brown on all  sides.    4. Add all other ingredients, but reserve the 1/2 cup whole almonds for a  garnish.    5. Cook over a low flame for at least 40 minutes, keeping an eye open to  make sure there is enough liquid. Add more broth if necessary.    6. Add salt and pepper to taste.    7. Serve with rice and garnish with remaining almonds.    VARIATION: Skip the almonds and add different dried fruit, such as pears,  cherries, or currants. Also works well with dried apples, if you also  substitute the orange juice for apple juice. This also works well with  beef. Just cook longer, and dont brown the meat in the beginning.
