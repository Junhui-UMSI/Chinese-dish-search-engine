Beer Cheese Soup
chicken broth, Flour, Beer, milk, pasteurized, butter, Worcestershire Sauce, 
Also GREAT for a warm vegetable dip or scrumptious as a cheese sauce for  recipes!    In a medium saucepan, melt the margarine/butter. Stir in flour until  smooth.    Gradually add milk, then the chicken broth, stirring until smooth. Heat and  continue to stir until bubbly and "thickened". Reduce heat and add cheese.    Continue to heat and stir; simmer 5 to 10 minutes, stirring ocassionally.  Add beer and Worcestershire Sauce. Heat through, BUT DO NOT BOIL !!
