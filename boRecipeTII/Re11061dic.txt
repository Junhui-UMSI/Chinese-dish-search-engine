(pinecones that create colored flames when theyre burned)    Copyright (c) 1995Virginia B. Sauer    Brilliant red, green, blue, purple, and orange colored flames in the  fireplace are especially festive and make lovely gifts.    Potassium chloride is simply salt substitute, which many families keep on  their kitchen tables.If you wish to experiment making these, you might try  using salt substitute and readily available cones or pods.    According to Elizabeth Creegan (a chemist who very kindly checked these out  for me), "These solutions are not caustic and dont present a fume hazard,  so you dont have to get too paranoid about them, but they should be  treated as poisonous, and should be washed up thoroughly".    A basket of these cones makes a lovely gift.If desired, attach a gift card  reading "May you always see beauty in your world".    MATERIALS NEEDED -- Copyright (c) 1995Virginia B. Sauer    1 (2 1/2 - 3 gallon capacity) glass container or very sturdy plastic (NOT  METAL) bucket or pail FOR EACH COLOR          1    wooden stick FOR EACH COLOR    Rubber gloves    Safety glasses and/or mask (optional; to avoid dust)    Dry pine cones (or cones/pods of your choice)    *Chemicals are available from a chemical supply house (check the yellow  pages).    I have been told that technical grade is cheaper and works fine.    Do not accept nitrates or chlorates as substitutes... they are too  dangerous.    PROCEDURE -- Copyright (c) 1995Virginia B. Sauer    Work outdoors or in a well-ventilated garage WHERE THERE WILL BE NO SMALL  CHILDREN OR PETS AROUND, and wear protective gloves.If available, wear  safety glasses.Tale care to keep chemicals away from your eyes, face, et  cetera.    ~-Pour 1 gallon warm water into each pail, then into each put 1 pound of  one of the following chemicals: Calcium Chlorideto make orange flames,  Copper Chloride *to make green flames, Copper Sulphateto make blue flames,  Potassium Chlorideto make purple flames, Strontium Chlorideto make red  flames.    ~-Stir with wooden stick until chemical has dissolved, then put dry pine  cones into the pail.    ~-Cover with lid or similar object to weight down cones (so they will  remain submerged under water).    ~-Let stand for a full 24 hours.(If in the garage, make sure that no  children or pets can wander in.)    ~-Wash your hands after removing the rubber gloves.    ~-At the end of the 24-hour period, remove cones and set on newspaper  thicknesses to dry.    ~-Safely dispose of the solutions by washing them down the sink with LOTS  of water.
