Batilda Paulista (Brazilian Rum with Lemon Juice)
Lemon juice, Ice cubes, Lemon slice, Egg whites, Cachaca (brazilian rum), Sugar, superfine, 
1. Combine the egg white and sugar in a mixing glass, and stir with a bar  spoon to dissolve the sugar. Add the cachaca, lemon juice and ice cubes.  Place a bar shaker on top of the mixing glass and, grasping the glass and  shaker firmly together with both hands, shake them vigorously 9 or 10  times. Remove the shaker, place a strainer on top of the glass and pour  into a chilled old-fashioned glass. With a sharp knife, slit the lemon  slice from the peel just to the center, and use the slit to hold the slice  on the rim of the glass.
