Leek Salad
Young leeks; up to 5, Water, Salt; (depends on the, Lemon juice, Salad oil, Egg, 
Use only young leeks. After thorough cleaning (of course), cut them in 5-7  cm pieces, (about 2 inches). Use the white part, possibly also the  beginning of the green. Cook them in salted boiling water until they are  tender but still whole. (Check with a knife).    Take them out of the water and arrange them nicely on a platter. Mix some  lemon juice and a little salad oil and pour on the vegetable. Let cool a  few hours in the fridge.    Before serving, grate a hard boiled egg and sprinkle it on the leek. Looks  a bit exotic and it is very refreshing.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Danielle Latowicki <latowick@actcom.co.il>  on Sep 26, 1998,
