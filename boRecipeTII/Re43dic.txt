INTRO: Desperation Dinners, By Beverly Mills, with Alicia Ross Sept/1998  spotlights what Lorene Cook Lambert of Cross Plains, Tenn., did with  Grandmother Ebbies corn and tomato soup. This recipe is so quick, theres  plenty of time to stir up a box of corn-bread mix if you cant find bakery  muffins. The muffins act as a giant crouton when the soup is ladled over  them. Or you can serve the muffins on the side.    DIRECTIONS: Make a small slit in the plastic pouch containing the  cream-style corn; microwave 3 minutes on high. Meanwhile, melt butter over  medium heat in a 4 1/2-quart Dutch oven or soup pot. Peel and coarsely chop  the onion, adding the onion to the pot as you chop. Cook the onion for 3  minutes, until slightly softened.    Meanwhile, open the broth and tomato cans.    Add the garlic to the onions; cook 30 seconds. Add the chicken broth,  tomatoes, corn kernels, cream-style corn and pepper to taste. Raise the  heat to high. Bring the soup just to a boil, stirring from time to time,  then reduce the heat to medium. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for  5 minutes or until ready to serve. Cut corn muffins in half, place 2 muffin  halves in each bowl, and ladle the soup over them.
