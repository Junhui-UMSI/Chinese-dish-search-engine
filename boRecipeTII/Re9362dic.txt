Puliszka - Polenta with Feta Cheese
Feta cheese, Dill, chopped, Corn meal, polenta, Sour cream, Water, Butter, 
Cook Polenta in slightly salted water. Add butter. Stir it well. When all  water disappeared, add feta cheese and sour cream but do not stir to well,  and do not cook it anymore. The cheese and the sour cream should not be  blended in the polenta, but vaguely mixed in. Before serving heat it up in  the oven, sprinkle freshly chopped dill on top. This is a delicious dish!    You can also top it with fried onions: slice large purple or white onions  in thin rings, fry them without anything in hot oil or butter until dark  brown and crisp, drain it, salt it and sprinkle on the polenta.
