Baked Corn
Bacos?, Ears corn, 
Cut corn kernels off the cob and scrape cob with a spoon to collect the  remaining juices. Season with salt, pepper and bacon bits and spread in a  thin layer over a shallow pan that has been sprayed with cooking oil spray  (Pam.) Bake at 400 degrees until heated through.    NOTES : In the original recipe, it calls for bacon drippings as a  seasoning, to taste, I substituted cooking spray and bacon bits.
