I just had this drink at work.  This was very good.  The recipe may be  attributed to Dr. Mary Kay Howetts Mother in Law:     Combine the base ingredients in a crock pot and heat:  Once the sugar is  completely dissolved add the liquid ingredients and allow to come to a  pleasing temperature (130-140 F).     Note: The nonalcoholic version can be made by omitting the ruby port wine.    ECABLE@PSU.EDU (ED CABLE)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
