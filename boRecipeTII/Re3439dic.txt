Pecan Christmas Cake
Lemon juice, Sugar, Salt, Flour, Baking Powder, Pecans, Eggs, Butter, Lemon peel; grated, Vanilla, Golden raisins, 
Cream butter & sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add lemon  juice, peel & vanilla. Mix raisins, nuts & 1/4 cup flour. Sift remaining  dry ingredients. Alternately fold nuts & raisins and dry ingredients into  creamed mixture. Spoon into a greased, paper- linde 10-inch tube pan. Bake  in slow oven (at 300) about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Cool. Remove from pan.  (I use small loaf pans.) VARIATION: For a sweeter, more moist cake, pour a  syrup made from 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup lemon juice & 1/4 cup sugar  over cake while it is still hot.
