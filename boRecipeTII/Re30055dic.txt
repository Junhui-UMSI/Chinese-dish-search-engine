I just poured the warm couscous into  a large shallow stainless steel bowl I use for mixing/tossing big salads  and let it sit there while I was washing and preparing the green onions and  basil. I stirred it around a few times, and it cooled off fine.    Also, I spread the green olives in a ring around the edge of my serving  bowl. It looked nice, and they were easier to avoid for anyone who is not  as crazy about green olives as I am. Posted to EAT-L Digest by Lynne Fraser  <Lynne_Fraser@BROWN.EDU> on Jul 7, 1997
