Beef a Roni
Corn, Whole Kernel  , Ground Beef, Lean, Tomato sauce, Spaghetti Sauce, Onion, Mushrooms, Pasta Shells, salt and pepper, 
Brown ground beef in a large frying pan. Add spaghetti sauce, tomato sauce,  corn, sliced mushrooms and chopped onion. Simmer until the mushrooms are  cooked. Add seasonings and continue to simmer.  In a large pot cook the  shells and drain. Mix sauce with shells and serve.  Leftovers are even  better and I always make extra.  From: Syds Cookbook.
