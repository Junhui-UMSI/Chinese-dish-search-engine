Worlds Easiest Trifle
Garnish, Instant vanilla pudding, Fresh strawberries, Fresh bananas, peaches, canned, Trifle dish, Angel food cake, Whipping cream, 
Line bottom of trifle dish with cake cubes. Cover with layer of vanilla  pudding. Place banana slices around the outside edge of trifle dish,  standing on their edge, so you can see layer of banana slices from the  outside. Cover the pudding with a layer of sliced bananas. Layer of cake  cubes, cover with layer of pudding. Place strawberry slices around outside  edge of trfile dish, standing up, all points of berries in the same  direction, or alternating. Cover the pudding layer with sliced berries.    Layer of cake cubes, cover with pudding. Place peach slices around outside  edge, etc.    Cover with layer of cake cubes, top with whipped whipping cream. Garnish as  desired with extra fruit or slivered almonds. (Colored sprinkles or  chocolate shot is not a good idea as they melt and look runny. If you use  maraschino cherries, rinse and dry well or you will have the same problem)  Adjust the amount of cake, pudding, fruit, etc. depending on the size of  your bowl. Left over cake can be eaten by willing family members, or frozen  for future use.    Many people also dip the cake in liqueur or drizzle liqueur over the cake.  We like it plain and light at our house. This is a good "fancy" dessert for  those concerned with calories as angel food cake has no fat and is quite  low in calories compared to other cake. You can use Jello light pudding  (carries the COR kosher endorsement) and make it with 1% milk. Whippping  cream can be left off the top entirely, or a low fat substitute can be  used, or the dieter can just avoid the cream on top since it is not mixed  in the middle.
