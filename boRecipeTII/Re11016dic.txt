This easy dish is typical of English cooking. I sometimes forget that  General Washington was born in England and knew this kind of food very  well. While he broke with England politically, he certainly did not give up  his favorite dishes from the Old Empire. On the other hand, his menus  always offered a wide selection of American food products such as turkey,  pumpkin, and corn. (Ragoo, rather than ragout, was the Colonial spelling.)      Fry the bread crumbs in a pan with the butter. Cook just until they are  golden brown, stirring all the while.      Melt the butter in a large skillet and add the onions, both kinds. When  they are a light brown, add the flour and stir until the flour thickens the  dish a bit. Add the salt, pepper, brown gravy, and mustard. Bring to a  simmer and serve with the bread crumbs on top.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
