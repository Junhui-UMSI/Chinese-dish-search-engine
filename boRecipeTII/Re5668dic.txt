Pineapple Willies Jack Daniels Barbecue Sauce
Vinegar, Tomato paste, Tabasco, Onion, Catsup, Garlic, Brown Sugar, Worcestershire Sauce, Black pepper, Molasses, Liquid smoke, Salt, 
Combine onion, garlic, and Jack Daniels Whiskey in a 3-quart saucepan.  Saute until onion and garlic are translucent, approximately 10 minutes.  Remove from heat and light mixture; flame for 20 seconds. Add all remaining  ingredients.  Bring to a boil, then turn down to a medium simmer. Simmer 20  minutes, stirring constantly. Run sauce through a medium strainer to remove  onion and garlic bits if you prefer a smoother sauce. Cool and enjoy. NOTE:  This sauce gets better with age. If time permits, keep it in the  refrigerator a day or so to develop a deeper, richer taste.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #241 by roy@indy.net (Roy) on Sep 11, 1997
