IT-TOOK-FORTY-YEARS-TO-GET-IT-RIGHT BOSTON BAKED BEANS     Soak beans at least overnight in the 6 cups of water (longer is even  better).  Drain, cover with fresh water, add the bay leaves, and simmer  covered until *very* tender, about two hours.  Drain, place half in a bean  pot or other casserole with a tight-fitting top. Add all other ingredients.  Place remaining beans in pot, cover with boiling water, and bake tightly  covered (use a sheet of heavy aluminum foil tightly crimped around the top  if your casserole doesnt have a cover) in a 325 degree F (160 degree C)  oven for about 7 hours. Remove top, pull piece of meat (if using) to top of  mixture so it can brown, and bake another hour uncovered. (Note: its a  good idea to check water level after about 5 hours, and add more boiling  water if necessary to keep the water level above beans until its time to  uncover.)     Serve (on Saturday night, of course) with ketchup or chili sauce, and  steamed brown bread.  If you want to be quite traditional, reheat leftovers  and serve with codfish cakes or balls for Sunday breakfast.  Freezes well,  so if your bean pot is large enough, do two pounds at a time and stock up.    ESTHER@ROCHGTE.FIDONET.ORG    (ESTHER VAIL)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
