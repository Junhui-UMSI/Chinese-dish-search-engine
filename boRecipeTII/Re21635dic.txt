Mix egg  yolks, lemon juice and water and sprinkle over flour mixture; blend lightly  until dough is formed. Divide dough into two parts. Roll first piece to fit  bottom and sides of 9x13 pan.    FILLING: Arrange apples (or cherry filling) in crust-lined pan, then  sprinkle over with sugar-cinnamon mixture. Roll remaining dough to fit top;  arrange over filling, fold and crimp/seal around edges. Cut steam vents in  top crust. Bake about 35-40 minutes at 400 degrees.    ICING: Mix and spread over baked slices while slightly warm.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
