From: dartji@gdss.grumman.com (Jim Dart !!!)    Date: Sat, 25 Jun 1994 16:08:45 GMT  I make this all the time. Got this recipe from a freinds mother who swore  it was in her family for more than 50 years and came from Italy.    Separate egg yolks from egg whites.  Beat egg yolks with sugar until creamy  smooth.  Add the mascarpone cream cheese and liqueur.  Beat egg  whites  until firm and fluffy. Fold into mascarpone cream mixture.    Dip lady fingers into coffee. Layer bottom of deep dish. Cover with  mascarpone mixture. Repeat biscuits and mascarpone mixture layers. Sprinkle  with semi-sweet chocolate shavings. Refrigerate overnight  before serving.  May also be frozen.    For a variation:  Sprinkle semisweet chocolate shavings in between every  layer.
