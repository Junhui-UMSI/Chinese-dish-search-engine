Combine it with the string beans, onion, lemon grass,  cilantro, chiles, fish sauce, slightly beaten egg, cornstarch and sugar.  Blend well.  Shape fish mixture into patties 2" in diameter, 1/2" thick.  Preheat oil to 350 degrees F.  Fry just a few at a time until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels, and serve with Cucumber Sauce.    CUCUMBER SAUCE: Thinly slice cucumber, arrange in bowl; peeling is  optional. Dissolve sugar in the boiling water. Stir in vinegar and salt.  Pour this sauce over cucumber. Sprinkle with the chopped chiles and  shallots. Chill. Garnish with sprigs of cilantro, if you like it, right  before serving.
