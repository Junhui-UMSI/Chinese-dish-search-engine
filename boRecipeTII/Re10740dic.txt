Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add  garlic and cook until beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Remove garlic  and reserve. Add tomatoes and basil sprigs to saucepan. Reduce heat and  simmer until soup thickens to chunky puree, mashing tomatoes with spoon,  about 15 minutes.  Season soup generously with salt and pepper.    Brush toast with oil, rub with reserved garlic and sprinkle with salt and  pepper.  Discard basil sprigs. Ladle soup into bowls. Drizzle with oil. Top  each with toast and basil julienne.                      Recipe from Bon Appetit, September, 1987
