Peppered Vodka
Fresh jalepeno chilies, Inexpensive vodka, 
Wash chilies and pat dry. Place chilies in a clean 1-qt bottle. Add vodka  to fill. Allow to set at least for 48 hours.    COMMENTS: Can be made even hotter by cutting up the jalepenos. If you do  this, strain the liquid back into another jar after 48 to 72 hours. May  also be made from serranos or habaneros.
