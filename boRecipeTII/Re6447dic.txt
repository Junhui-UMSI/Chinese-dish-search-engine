Servings:  6    Prepare pastry - combine flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon, cut in shortening  (may use butter if desired). Make well in center, add milk, blend. Mix to a  dough, wrap and let chill for 20-30 minutes.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.    Roll pastry to line a 10" pie pan, trim and crimp edges, prick bottom and  sides with fork and bake for 20 minutes. Remove and let cool.    Rinse plums, cut in half, remove pits.  Place in saucepan with brown sugar  over low heat. (They are moist enough not to need any water.) Cover and  simmer gently for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and using slotted spoon  remove plums. Reserve juices.    Spread cream cheese evenly over bottom of pastry, arrange plums over  cheese.  Whisk cornstarch into plum juices, return to heat, stirring until  thickens, cook, stirring occasionally, for a few minutes. Remove from heat  and stir in Kirsch, pour over plums, using a pastry brush to spread the  mixture evenly.  Chill until the glaze has set.    A soft, beautiful dish that will appeal to the esthetic in Taurus. Plum  tart is particularly delicious served with whipped cream or a thick custard  and a sweet white dessert wine.
