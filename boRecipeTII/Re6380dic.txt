Pleasing Potato Pie
Onion, Potatoes, cheddar cheese, Eggs, Salt, milk, cooked ham, Pepper, 
Combine potatoes, 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Press into the  bottom and up sides of a greased 9-in. pie plate. In a bowl, beat eggs and  milk. Add ham, onion, pepper and remaining cheese and salt; pour over  potato crust (dish will be very full). Bake at 350 for 45-50 minutes or  until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
