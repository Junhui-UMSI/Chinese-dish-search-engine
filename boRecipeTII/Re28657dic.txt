Select 24 salad peppers; set others aside for garnish. Remove and discard  stems and seeds from peppers; drain thoroughly on paper towels. Stuff each  pepper with 1 piece Monterey Jack cheese and 1 piece chicken; set aside.  Spray both sides of 4 phyllo sheets with cooking spray; stack. Cut phyllo  in half lengthwise and then crosswise.
