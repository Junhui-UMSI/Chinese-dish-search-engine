On paper towels, pat tofu dry on all sides. Cut tofu crosswise into  1/2-inch thick slices. On small plate, place cornstarch.    Heat nonstick wok or large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add 2  tablespoons oil and swirl to coat pan. One at a time, dip tofu slices into  cornstarch to coat cut surfaces and place in wok. Fry until well browned on  one side--about 5 minutes . Turn tofu slices and fry other sides until well  borwned. Transfer tofu to center of large serving platter; cover with foil  and keep warm.    Add broth and gingerroot to wok and heat to boiling. Add bok choy; cover  and cook until tender and most of broth evaporates--about 5 minutes.    Meanwhile, prepare Sauce. In small bowl, combine vegetable broth,  oyster-flavored sauce, soy sauce, cornstarch, sugar and sesame oil.    With slotted spoon or pancake turner, remove bok choy and place, cut sides  down, around rim of platter with tofu; cover and keep warm. Discard ginger  slices and any remaining broth.    Reheat wok over high heat until hot. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the  mushrooms. Stir-fry mushrooms until softened--about 3 minutes. Restir Sauce  and pour over mushrooms; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and  bubbly. Transfer mushrooms from Sauce and place over tofu. Pour Sauce over  all.
