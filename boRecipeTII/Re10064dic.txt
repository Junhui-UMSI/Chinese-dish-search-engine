Toast the almonds  in jelly-roll pan in a preheated 375F oven for 10 minutes and let them  cool.  In a blender or food processor grind fine one fourth of the almonds  with 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar and transfer the mixture to a large  bowl.  Stir in the flour, the remaining 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the brown  sugar, the cinnamon, and the baking powder, add the butter, and stir the  mixture until it is combined.  Stir in the remaining almonds, chopped  coarse, and the eggs and knead the dough in the bowl until it is combined.  Halve the dough and with floured hands form each half into a 15-by-4 inch  rectangle. Transfer the rectangles with spatulas to buttered and floured  baking sheets, brush them well with the egg wash, and bake them in the  upper third of a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are  golden brown and a skewer comes out clean. Cut the rectangles crosswise  into 3/4-inch-thick slices and let the slices stand in the turned off oven  for 15 minutes. Transfer the slices to racks, let them cool, and store them  in airtight containers. Makes about 36 biscotti.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
