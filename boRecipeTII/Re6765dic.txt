Just from the ingredients I would never have guessed this to be a  Mexican recipe.    We thank Angela de Leon Perez for this delightful chicken in cream  sauce. Disjoint the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and saute  in shortening until golden brown and almost done.  Turn once or twice  to brown evenly. When almost done, remove chicken from bones and cut  into chunks.    Prepare a rich white sauce according to your favorite recipe and add  to it 2 well-beaten egg yolks.  Cook noodles according to directions  on package and add white sauce, salt, pepper, grated cheese, and meat  extract, and pour into a buttered ring mold.  Heat in a 350F oven  over a pan of hot water for about 1/2 hour or until mold is firm.    Place chicken pieces in cream and heat, but do not allow the cream to  boil. Unmold the noodles and fill with creamed chicken in the center.  Garnish with watercress.    Makes 4 or 5 servings.    From "The Art of Mexican Cooking" by Jan Aaron and Sachs Salom.
