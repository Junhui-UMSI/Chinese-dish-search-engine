Chickpeas, Salt, Lemon juice, Matzo meal, Eggs, Salt, Cumin, Coriander, Garlic pwdr, Oil for deep frying, TAHINA SAUCE, Tahina*, Water; plus, Water, Garlic pwdr, Cayenne pepper, Black pepper, 
These are recipes taken from <Love and Best Dishes>, a cookbook from the  Agudas Achim Synagogue Sisterhood, in San Antonio, Tx. The recipe was  submitted by Hinda Greenberg.    Soak the chickpeas overnight. Grind chickpeas finely, and add other  ingredients. Shape into small balls, and deep fry until brown. Sere hot in  "pita" bread, and top with tahina (sesame seed paste) sauce.    TAHINA SAUCE:    *tahina - you can find this - its ground sesame seed paste, thick like  peanut butter - in jars in import sections of large grocery stores    Place all ingredients in a blender for a few minutes. Adjust seasonings to  taste. Serve over felafel. (Should be consistency of a creamy salad  dressing)    Note: I usually use fresh mashed garlic (3-4 toes) in place of garlic pwdr,  and I put extra lemon juice (Ill use 1/4 to 1/2 c of fresh squeezed -- I  prefer a lemony tasting tahina.)
