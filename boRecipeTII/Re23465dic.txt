Turkey Apple Hash (r T)
Boneless Skinless Turkey, Apples, Mcintosh, Potatoes, Fennel Seeds, Apple Cider, Olive Oil, Onion, Black Pepper, 
*NOTE: The original recipe called for 2 t vegetable oil...I used 1t.    This wonderfully homey dish is great left over too. A portion is  plenty-filling, especially if you sprinkle it with shredded carrot and fill  your plate with cucumber.    Place large nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat 30 seconds. Add oil;  heat 30 seconds more. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until soft,  5 - 6 min. Stir in turkey and continue cooking until browned on all sides.    Stir in apples, potato, cider and fennel seeds, if using; partially cover  and cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft and turkey is cooked  through, about 5 min. Sprinkle with pepper.    Serving size: about 3/4 C    This is REALLY good!!  Recipe by: Weight Watchers Magazine, Mar 1996, pg 62    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n016, by Reggie Dwork <reggie@reggie.com> on  Thu, 16 Jan 1997.
