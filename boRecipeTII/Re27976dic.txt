Three Cup Chicken
Cloves garlic; smashed, Each: soy sauce; cooking, Fresh ginger root, Fresh basil, Chicken legs, Sugar, Sesame oil; preferably dark, 
Wash the chicken legs and remove excess fat. Chop into approximately 1-1/2"  chunks. Place in a baking dish and heat in the microwave for five minutes.  Remove, wash, and set aside. Choose the freshest and most tender of the  basil leaves, wash, and set aside. Preheat the sesame oil in the microwave  for 2 minutes. Fry the ginger and garlic in the oil for 1-1/2 minutes. Mix  in the chicken and the soy sauce, cooking wine, and sugar. Return to the  microwave and heat for 12 minutes. Mix in the fresh basil leaves and serve.  Note: I just mix all the ingredients (except the basil, which is added  after cooking) together and cook in a ceramic pot with a glass cover over  medium-low heat on a regular gas range. Also, I increase the amount of  fresh garlic used. Use whole smashed garlic cloves with the skin removed.
