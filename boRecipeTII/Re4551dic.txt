Petin Salsa
Petins, Salt, Onion, Chopped celantro leaves, Lime; juice of, Small-medium tomato;, -(up to), -(up to), 
My recipe for petin salsa is a handfull(10-20) of petins, mashed in the  molcajete or bowl, add 1/4 to 1/2 onion chopped, add salt to cover onion  lightly, add 1/2 lime as juice,  mash up some more to de-nature the onion,  add chopped celantro leaves to taste(none if yur allergic), and 1 tomato  small to medium, chopped. mash to consistency you like. Ageing one day  improves flavor, and allows the lime juice and salt to make a vinegar that  permeates the mix. I cheat and add some Ms. Dash or spices of the day for  variety sometimes: try avocado and Grey Poupon or Guldens Spicy mustard  for that "What the HELL IS this stuff look" on your guests face! Theyll  love it after they catch their breath..    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
