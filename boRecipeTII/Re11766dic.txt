Place all vegetables in large roasting pan. Combine remaining ingredients  and pour over vegetables. Place roasting pan in a 350 degree oven and cook  for about 2 hours, stirring every 1/2 hour. Serve over rice.    This recipe is a super way to use all the surplus from the garden. You can  use different quanities of each vegetable depending on what you have.  Sometimes I add small little potatoes. This recipe freezes very well.
