Pickled Fish (Paksiw)
Fresh ginger, Vinegar, Water, Salt, Smelts, 
I have two smelts recipes that are really easy and lowfat (except for the  coconut milk -- see if you can find the lowfat kind) and delicious if you  like that tangy vinegar taste. These are Filipino recipes and so are meant  to be eaten with steamed rice. These are both from Marilyn Donatos  _Philippine Cooking in America_.    Combine all ingredients in a covered pot. Boil 5 minutes, uncover and cook  3 minutes more or until half of broth has evaporated. Serve hot or cold.  Serves 6.
