Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Core and thinly slice the apples; thinly  slice the potatoes.  Heat oil and coat the bottom and sides of a large,  cast-iron skillet. As neatly as possible; place a layer of potatoes in a  spiral fashion, using half the potatoes. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and  half the onion.  Place a layer of apples slices. Repeat the layering. Grate  some nutmeg on the top and press the mixture down with a plate. Remove the  plate and bake until the apples are temder and potatoes are crisp and  borwn, about 35 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before cutting  into wedges to serve.
