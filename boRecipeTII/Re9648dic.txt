Pumpkin Mousse (Mf)
Pecans, Rum, Dried apricots, Butter, Ground allspice, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Heavy cream, Unsweetened pumpkin pie, Brown sugar, 
In a small saucepan, combine the dried apricots with the rum. Bring this to  a boil, cover and simmer for 1 minute. Let apricots cool in the pot,  covered.    In a mixing bowl combine the pumpkin, butter, sugar and spices and chopped  nuts.    When the apricots are cool enough to handle, cut them into 1/2 inch pieces  and stir them into the pumpkin. Chill the mixture. Whip the heavy cream  until stiff and fold most of the cream into the mousse, reserving some  whipped cream if you wish for decoration.    Chill until serving time. Transfer mixture to wine goblets. If you are  serving this to company, then spoon remaining whipped cream into a pastry  bag and pipe some whipped cream rosettes into center of mousse in each  glass.
