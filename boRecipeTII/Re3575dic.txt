Pecan Tassies
Egg, FILLING, PASTRY DOUGH, Pecans, all purpose soft wheat flour, Salt, Butter, Butter, Cream cheese, Brown sugar, Vanilla, 
Prehead oven to 325F.  Mix together the butter and cream cheese in a small  bowl or food processor.  Add the flour and blend thoroughly. Divide and  shape into 30 balls. Wrap all 30 balls together in plastic wrap and chill  slightly.  Place each ball in a tiny ungreased fluted tart pan or muffin  cup.  Line the pans by pressing the dough with your fingertips against the  bottoms and sides. For the filling, place half the pecans in the  dough-lined pan.  Beat together the egg, sugar, butter, vanilla, sand salt  until all lumps are gone. Pour the egg mixture onto the pecan topped dough.  Dot with the remaining pecans. Bake for 25 minutes or until the filling is  set.  Cool 5 minutes on a rack and remove from the pans before they are  cool, as the caramel will set. These tiny tarts freeze easily.
