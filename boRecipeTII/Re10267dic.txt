Quick Apple Crisp
Brown sugar, Apple pie spice, Flour, Apples (I used Rome), Butter, 
Peel and slice the apples & place them in a microwave-safe baking dish.  Combine reminaing ingredients, and mix until crumbly.  Pour over apples.  Microwave for 4-5 minutes on HIGH.    I adapted a recipe that i found in my Meal Master database in order to get  this.  I dont know where the original one came from, since the source  wasnt listed.  It tasted good, though, even if it was slightly less  crisply than apple crisp could be.
