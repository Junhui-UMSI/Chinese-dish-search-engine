Approximate preparation time: 30 minutes    My Notes:    Served at Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood, Portland, Oregon Published in  Timberline Lodge Cookbook (1987) by Leif Eric Benson (Certified Executive  Chef of Timberline Lodge since 1979.)    If you see the movie "The Shining" you will see the lodge. It was used for  all the exterior shots. Scary place. Our Timberline is NOT scary. It is ski  resort on top of Mount Hood, within minutes from downtown Portland. The  lodge has rooms, a gourmet restaurant, pool. Built during Depression by WPA  from timber in the area. The cookbook has gorgeous photos.
