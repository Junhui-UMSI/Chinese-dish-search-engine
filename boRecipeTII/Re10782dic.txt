Quick-Cooked Tomatillo-Chile Sauce
Onion, Low sodium chicken broth, Fresh tomatillos, Fresh Cilantro, Salt, garlic, Vegetable oil, Fresh serrano peppers, 
See Substitutions.  Have the measure of broth ready.    Cook fresh serrano or jalapeno peppers in boiling salted water until tender  ~ about 5 minutes. (NOTE - If using fresh tomatillos, cook them with  chiles.)    Place tomatillos and chiles in a blender or food processor, along with  cilantro, onion, and garlic.  Stir.  Process until smooth, but retain a  little texture.    See TIP!  Heat oil in a medium-large non-stick skillet set over medium-high  heat.  When oil is hot   -- enough to make a drop of the puree sizzle  sharply -- pour the tomatillo mixture in the skillet all at once and stir  constantly for 4 to 5 minutes, until mixture becomes darker and thicker.    Add broth, return to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until  thick enough to coat a spoon, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Season with salt, as  needed.   Makes 2 cups.  Use as an ingredient, a sauce, a salsa, etc.  __________ TIP! Transfer the contents of the blender or food processor to  an "easy-to-handle" bowl.
