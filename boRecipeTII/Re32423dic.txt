Grease and flour a round baking pan, about 8 inches  in diameter.    Prepare the syrup by placing all the ingredients in a small pan and  bringing slowly to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes  or until the syrup forms a sticky film on the back of a spoon. Set aside to  cool.    Chop the almonds finely.  Pour the yogourt into a bowl, add half the melted  butter, sugar, semolina, baking powder, vanilla and almonds.  Mix  thoroughly until well blended. Pour the batter into the cake pan and smooth  over the surface with the back of a spoon.    Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the surface of the cake is golden.  Remove from the oven and pour the cold syrup evenly over it.  Cut into  lozenge shapes and return to the oven for 3-4 more minutes.    Warm the remaining butter.  Remove the basbousa from the oven and pour the  butter evenly over the surface.  Leave to cool.
