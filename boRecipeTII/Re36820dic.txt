<excerpt>The Aphrodisiac Cookbook    http://www.digitalchef.com/kitchen/channels/recipes/    "I have to admit to you that when Sharon told me she was going to make a  meal for me that would curl my toes, I was thrilled. Sharon is a great cook  who rarely has muchtime. When she told me that the main course was  strawberry pasta, I was totally disappointed. I am a proud meat and  potatoes kind of guy after all and strawberry pasta just sounded  so=85so=85wimpy. But I kept all of this to myself - thank the culinary  gods. Because that night Sharon found a way to make strawberries, cream,  and noodles taste like ambrosia. She also found a way to curl my toes. I  think my meat and potato days are over."
