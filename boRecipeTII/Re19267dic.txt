Vegetable Shortening Cakes
Peanut butter, Solid vegetable shortening, White or whole wheat flour, Cracked corn, Yellow cornmeal, 
Melt the shortening, remove it from the heat; add the peanut butter and  blend well. Mix in remaining ingredients. Spoon this mixture into molds  (cupcake liners in a muffin tin, margarine tubs or put foil in a 4" x 4" x  1" box) or fill the crevices of pine cones with it. Chill. If you make  cakes, remove the molds and store the cakes in plastic sandwich bags in  your freezer until needed.    This isnt a "true" suet cake.  This recipe makes a softer cake which is  great for stuffing in the crevices of pine cones.    Makes six 4" x 4" x 1" cakes, six margarine tub sized cakes or 13 to 20  muffin size cakes.
