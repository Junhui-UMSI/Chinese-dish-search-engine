Vegan Pumpkin Pie
Vegetable oil, Unbaked pie crust, pumpkin, Allspice, Nutmeg, Ground cinnamon, Molasses, Ginger, Fruit source, Firm silken tofu, Vanilla extract, 
Blend all ingredients, pour into pie shell and bake for 1 hour and 350 or  till done.    Note that this is even better, if more expensive, if you use 2/3 cup maple  syrup instead of the fruit source and reduce the oil to a scant 1/4 cup.
