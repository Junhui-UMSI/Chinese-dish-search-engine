A Better Burger
ground chuck, Salt, Black Pepper, Hamburger buns, 
1. Break up chuck to increase surface area for seasoning. Sprinkle salt and  pepper over meat" toss lightly with hands to distribute seasoning. Divide  meat into four equal portions (5 ounces each)- with cupped hands,    toss one portion of meat back and forth to form loose ball. Pat lightly to  flatten into 1 -inch-thick burger, 3 1/2 to 4 inches across, using  fingertips to create pocked, textured surface. Repeat with remaining  portions of meat.    2. If grilling, heat enough coals to make hot fire. When coals are hot and  covered with white ash, spread them in single layer. Position grill rack    and lid-, heat until rack is very hot, about 5 minutes. Place burgers on    rack-, cover and grill, turning once, to desired doneness as follows: 3  minutes per side for rare, 4 minutes per side for medium-rare, 5 minutes    on first side and 4 minutes on second side for medium, and 5 minutes per    side for well done. If pan-broiling, heat skillet over medium-high heat.    When skillet is hot (drops of water flicked into it evaporate immediately),  add parties and cook, turning once, to desired doneness, using same times  as if grilling. Serve immediately with buns and desired    toppings.    Cooks Illustrated, July/Aug. 1995, Page 15. Credit: Pam Anderson with  Karen Tack.
