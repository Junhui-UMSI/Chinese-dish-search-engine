Sift flour, cake flour, sugar and salt into a large mixing bowl.    Add shortening, yeast mixture and mil,.    Knead mixture 5 minutes to form a dough.  Cover with a damp cloth and set  dough in a warm place.  Allow the dough to rise for 3 hours.    Heat wok, add oil and stir-fry pork for 2 minutes.    Add 2 tablespoons water, salt, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce and hoisin  sauce.  Bring it to a boil.    Prepare thickening by mixing the cornstarch and 4 tablespoons cold water.  Stir into the mixture and cook for 1 minute. Let cool before using.    After 3 hours, when the dough has risen, shape into rolls about 2 inches in  diameter.  Cut each roll into 1-1/2 inch pieces.    Shape each piece into a shallow bowl shape.    Put 1 tablespoon filling in the center, close ans twist dough to form a  bun.  Put the bun on a 2 inch square of white paper.
