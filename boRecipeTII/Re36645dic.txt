Strawberry Chicken
Skinless chicken breasts OR, Skinless chicken thighs), Thinly sliced green onions, (about 12oz) tomato sauce, Dry thyme, Chili powder, Red wine vinegar, Strawberry jam, Ground ginger, 
In a shallow 3 quart casserole dish, mix tomato sauce, jam, vinegar, chili  powder, thyme and ginger.    Rinse chicken and pat dry, then add to sauce and turn to coat.    Bake in a 400 degree oven, basting occasionally until no longer pink.  Remove and garnish with onions.    Serve over brown rice with green beans (thats what I did anyway) or  whatever side dishes you like best.    If youre using a larger casserole dish, you might want to use a bit more  tomato sauce...and be sure to spray the pan with Pam.
