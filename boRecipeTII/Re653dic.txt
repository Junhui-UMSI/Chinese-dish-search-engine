The Cook & Kitchen Staff are offering you four different Thanksgiving Day  Dinner menus during November and were in the middle of our third recipe  collection featuring our "Metropolitan Thanksgiving Day Dinner" fare.    Todays vegetable side service may be prepared one day in advance of your  meal in order to reduce the conflict of a high-heat oven setting with your  main course. Simply prepare as directed, refrigerate, and warm in a  microwave- proof bowl before serving, making sure to use a low microwave  setting and to toss the sprouts several times to assure that the vegetables  are heated through.    Rinse and trim fresh Brussels sprouts. Place in a large pot of lightly  salted water over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium  and continue to boil until the sprouts are just tender, about 8 to 10  minutes.    Or drain thawed Brussels sprouts.    Pre-heat oven to 450-F degrees.    Place Brussels sprouts in a large roasting pan. Drizzle melted butter or  margarine over the top of the vegetable, and shake lightly to toss. Add  White Wine Worcestershire Sauce. Sprinkle sugar and salt evenly over the  top of the sprouts and toss with a spatula to blend.    Roast for about 20 minutes, shaking pan occasionally to keep the exposed  portions of the sprouts from drying out. Remove from the oven and cool for  5 minutes before placing in a service bowl. Serve warm.    Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by Recipe-a-Day  <recipe-a-day@bignetwork.com> on Nov 15, 1998, converted by MM_Buster  v2.0l.
