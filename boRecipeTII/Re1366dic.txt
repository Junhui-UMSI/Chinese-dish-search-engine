Easy Summer Chicken Bake
Chicken parts with bones, Onion, Green pepper, Fresh tomatos, Black Pepper, Fresh garlic, thyme, fresh, 
Method: Put chicken pieces in an oven-proof pan. ( I used a small roasting  pan with about 2 1/2 inch sides). Put herbs and vegetables all over the  chicken. do not cover the pan. Put in into a 400 F oven for 15-20 minutes,  reduce heat to 350 and continue to cook until it is almost done-perhaps 20  more minutes. If you want, move the vegetables aside and raise the  temperature to 425 to brown the chicken. As I remove the skin before  serving, this was not necessary. Serve with rice or noodles and a green  vegetable and salad for a wonderful dinner.    Note: I get my fresh thyme right from my lawn, which in our area is cut  down meadow. I just take my kitchen shears (cant spell the other word) and  snip the thyme which I know is organic as we put nothing on the lawn.    I think that in the winter with canned tomatos, etc, that some browning and  sauteing would make a better dish, but with all these fresh foods it seem  unnecessary for a great meal.
