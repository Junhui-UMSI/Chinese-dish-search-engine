Asparagus Soup
Asparagus, Dill, Rice milk, Potatoes, Unbleached flour, Salt to taste, 
Cut potatoes into small pieces.  In an approximately 3 qt. saucepan, boil  potatoes until extremely tender.  While this is happening, wash asparagus.  Remove woody ends.  Cut into 1" sections, setting aside tips.  Add non-tip  sections to potato pot and cook until asparagus has gone beyond bright  green to olive green (but not brown  :)).  Add dill.  Asparagus should be soft enough to mash along with  potatoes, in the cooking water.  Dont throw out any of the cooking water.    lightly brown flour in a small saucepan and allow to cool somewhat before  adding rice milk.  Add liquid gradually to make a smooth pseudo-roux and  add the roux to the soup. Add the asparagus tips and continue cooking the  soup just until they are tender and bright green. Salt to taste. Yum.    Source: Apparent Original    Posted by cgibas@cysteine.ncsa.uiuc.edu (Cynthia Gibas) to the Fatfree  Digest [Volume 16 Issue 12] Mar. 16, 1995.
