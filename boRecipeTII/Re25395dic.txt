It originally came on the back of a package of tortillas.  I  omitted olives and replaced all the dairy with fat free dairy and it came  out great! I also added frozen corn for more nutritional and taste value. I  think you may be able to substitute soy products to make it vegan, but I  have no idea how it would taste. The prep time is very quick, and its very  easy.    Slice tortillas into one inch strips; divide into 3 piles (4 tortillas  each) Mix sour cream, milk, Egg Beaters and cayenne until frothy. In 2 or 3  quart casserole dish, layer 1/3 tortilla strips, 1/3 onions, 1/3 chiles,  1/3 corn, and cheese. Pour 1/3 sour cream mixture over layer. Repeat  layers.  Cover with aluminium foil and bake in a 325F oven for 40-50  minutes, depending on the depth of your casserole dish.    The original recipe called for 3.5 cups of grated cheese--I found this to  be too much. I just put a thin layer of cheese on each layer. You can  increase or decrease the corn, chiles, and onions depending on your taste.  (Here in S. Florida, the chiles come in small cans; I think theyre about  3-4 oz. and its either El Rio or Ortega brand.)    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #57    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
