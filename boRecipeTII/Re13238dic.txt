Worstebroodjes or Pigs in the Blanket
Salt, Ground pepper, Frozen bread dough; thawed, Lean ground beef, Onion powder, Lean ground pork, 
In a mixing bowl, stir together the pork, beef, salt, onion powder and  pepper; divide into 12 portions. Form each portion into a sausage shaped,  3-inch long piece. Divide the bread dough into 12 equal portions. Flatten  each portion into a 4 x 3-inch rectangle. Place a portion of meat  lengthwise on each piece of dough. Fold in the sides of the dough; roll up.  Moisten and pinch the seams closed. Arrange the dough-wrapped meat, seam  side down, in a greased 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan. Cover and let the dough  rise in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes until the doubled. Bake at 350  degrees for about 35 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and the  meat is done inside. Serve warm. To reheat baked, chilled Worstebroodjes,  cover loosely with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes, or  until heated through. Or place on a microwave-safe plate and heat on medium  power for 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 minutes for 1 piece. Penny Halsey (ATBN65B).
