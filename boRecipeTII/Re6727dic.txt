Polish Dumplings - Pierogi
Eggs, Egg yolk, Vegetable oil, Flour, Butter, Sour cream, Salt, 
In a large bowl mix all the ingredients and knead into a soft pliable  dough. Cut in half and let rest covered, for 10 minutes. Roll out each half  into a thin circle. Using a drinking glass cut the dough into round circles  and fill them with desired filling (recipes follow). Place less than a  tablespoon of fillinf in the center of each circle and fold over. Press and  seal into a half moon. You may want to rub a bit of water on the edge in  order to get a great seal. Cook for 10 minutes in boiling salted water.  Drain. They can be pan-fried in butter at this point, if you wish for a  really tasty finish.
