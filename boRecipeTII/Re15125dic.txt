Wheat Beer 2
Hallertauer (finish 2 mins), Wheat/Malt extract, Hallertauer (boil 60, Crystal malt, DME, Wyeast Bavarian wheat yeast, Honey, Minutes), 
Cooled  overnight outside. Rack to new carboy next day and pitch  WYeast  Bavarian Wheat. This one turned out good. Light amber color, a bit on the  sweet side and I can taste a hint of clove.    Recipe By     : Mike Lang    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
