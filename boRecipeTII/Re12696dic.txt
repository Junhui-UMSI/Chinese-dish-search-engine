York Peppermint Brownies
brownie mix, York peppermint patties, 
Pour 1/2 the mix into the bottom of a greased pan. Place a layer of  peppermint patties in the pan (use the York brand - the cheaper brands do  not bake as well). Pour remainder of brownie mix on top and bake according  to directions. Cut brownies when they have cooled and you will see a layer  of peppermint. People are always amazed at how pretty it looks. To make  extra special, make a thin frosting of powdered sugar and milk and drizzle  on top then sprinkle with crushed candy canes.
