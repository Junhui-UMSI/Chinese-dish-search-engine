Pass the  tortillas, one at a time, through the oil to soften them.  Press between  paper towels to remove excess oil. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine  the second measure of Parmesan with the first measure of Mozzarella, the  Ricotta and the egg yolks. Use a food processor or blender to puree until  smooth and thoroughly combined. Divide the cheese mixture evenly among the  tortillas. Roll each tortilla up tightly. Place, seam side down, in a  baking dish just large enough to hold them. Brush with melted butter. Bake,  uncovered, until the tops of the tortillas are crisp (about 10 minutes).  Cover with salsa. Sprinkle the first measure of Parmesan and the second  measure of Mozzarella over. Cover lightly with aluminum foil, making sure  the foil DOES NOT TOUCH the tortillas or the sauce. Bake until the sauce is  heated and the cheese is melted (10-12 minutes).
