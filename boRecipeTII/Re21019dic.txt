I posted some North African recipes awhile ago and the spice mixture at the  end, Twabil, was left off somehow. Here it is . . .    This spice mixture is used in coulcous stews, salad dressings, and dips.  This makes 3-4 tablespoons. Try it in the other recipes if you like it in  Mechouia.    Mix all ingredients well and use in dishes for an authentic North African  flavor. Posted to fatfree digest V97 #043 by judy.mingram@West.Sun.COM  (Judy Mingram - SunSoft) on Mar 31, 1997
