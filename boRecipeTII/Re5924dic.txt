1. In microwave-safe cup, melt chocolate and set aside to cool. In  medium-size bowl, combine flour, cocoa, and baking powder; set aside.    2. In large bowl, with electric mixer on md speed, beat butter and  granulated and brown sugars until well mixed. Add 2 eggs, one at a time,  beating well after each addition. Separate remaining egg, placing egg white  in a cup, then cover and refrigerate.    3. Add egg yolk, chocolate, liqueur, and vanilla to butter mixture and beat  until well mixed. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually beat in flour  mixture to form soft dough. With spoon, stir in pistachios. Cover and  refrigerate dough at least 2 hours or until easy to handle.    4. Heat oven to 300F. Grease 1 large or 2 small baking sheets. With  floured hand, divide dough into 3 equal pieces.

Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until firm. Cool logs on wire rack 30 minutes.  Transfer logs to cutting board. Using serrated knife and a sawing motion,  cut each log diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Ar- range slices cut  side down on baking sheet.    6. Heat oven to 250F. Bake slices 15 minutes or until dry on the surface.  Cool slices on wire rack and store in airtight container.
