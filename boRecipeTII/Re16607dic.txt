BF: This is the best loaf of light, airy bread that I have made in my ABM.  I wish I could say what ABM Bread book it came from, but I got the recipe  before I was concerned about such things.  Never made it until now.    Author unknown.  U/L to Cooking by Burt Ford.   3/95 4/95 7/95 1/96 POUR  PAT STOCKETT  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #338 by pooh4jvn@ix.netcom.com on Dec 30,  1997
