* Have ice cream slightly softened. Use only a very good quality applesauce  that is not too thin.    1. Line a greased 15 x 10 x 1-inch jelly-roll pan with waxed paper; grease  paper. 2. Place eggs in a mixing bowl; beat at high speed for 5 minutes.  Gradually beat in sugar and 1/2 cup applesauce. 3. Sift flour, baking  powder, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg and salt together. Blend flour  mixture into egg mixture, using low speed. Spread batter in pan. 4. Bake in  preheated 375-degree oven for 15 minutes or until cake is lightly browned  and springs back when pressed gently. Sprinkle kitchen towel with powdered  sugar; immediately invert cake onto towel. 5. Remove waxed paper; roll cake  and towel together from narrow end. Let cake completely cool. 6. Unroll  cake, trimming edges if desired. Remove from towel and spread with softened  ice cream; re-roll. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or foil and freeze. 7.  Blend remaining 1-1/2 cups applesauce and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Chill.  When ready to serve, cut roll into slices and top each slice with chilled  applesauce. Serve with whipped cream if desired.
