Regarding LEFSE: I am 100% Norwegian and grew up on lefse. In the midwest  it was made by sweet little ladies who packaged it at home and sold it by  word of mouth or in smaller markets. Several members of my family could  make it and I fortunately have a very good recipe from a cousin. It takes  practice and patience but it is well worth the effort.    Add the shortening and butter to the potatoes FIRST. You do not want to add  too much flour, barely 11/2 cups total, so I usually add  about half that  and use the rest to roll it out as that is the most difficult part. Work  into a smooth dough and divide into balls about golfball size. (This  depends on the size of lefse you want.) Keep the balls in the refrigerator  while rolling dough because it rolls better if cool. Cool the balls for at  least an hour before you start rolling them.    The rolling is the tough part. As I said, keep the dough cool, flour the  board well and roll the balls out as thin as you can. You need to be fast .  Some people use a floured cloth on which to roll. You can buy long wooden  paddles to transer the "crepe" to a griddle. At any rate,transfer the  "crepe" to a hot griddle--teflon helps. Cook at about 425 until it begins  to bubble, turn and cook until it bubbles up from the griddle.Remove and  let cool.    It really takes a lot of practice to make lefse. It ends up to look a lot  like a tortilla but that is where the likeness stops. Lefse is used  much  like bread. It is buttered and rolled up and eaten with the meal. Another  way is to put butter and mayonnaise on it, roll it around meat and eat it  like a burrito.    Good luck!
