Pemmican
Raisins, Caribou Jerky, Brown sugar, Cranberries, Suet, 
Run the dry jerky through a food grinder a few times. In a loaf pan add the  cranberries, raisins and brown sugar.  When the mixture is well blended,  melt  the suet and stir it in.  Let the suet cool and harden. This approximates  the  old style pemmican made to preserve meat without refrigeration and to add  some  vitamin C values.
