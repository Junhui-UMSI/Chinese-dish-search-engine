World Wide Recipes List    Clafoutis is a classic French preparation that is sort of a cross between a  custard and a cake. The traditional recipes call for loads of egg yolks,  and originally only unpitted cherries were used for the filling (the pits  supposedly added more flavor). My version replaces a lot of the egg yolks  with apple sauce, and you can use almost any fruit, such as strawberries,  raspberries, blueberries, plums, grapes, or cherries.    Use the butter to grease a 9 inch (approx 25 cm) pie pan. In a bowl beat  the egg yolk and mix in the applesauce, sugar, flour, milk, and almond  extract. In another bowl beat the egg whites and the salt until stiff but  not dry. Fold the egg whites into the applesauce mixture and pour into the  prepared pie pan. Drop the cherries into the batter - do not press down.  Bake in a 350F (180C) oven for 20 minutes, until the clafoutis is golden  and puffy, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serves 6  to 8.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Goldtag1@aol.com on Aug 8, 1998, converted  by MM_Buster v2.0l.
