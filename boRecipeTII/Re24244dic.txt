In glass or stainless steel bowl, stir in wine, oil, herbs & jalapenos. Add  beef cubes, stir well & let stand at least 2 hours at room temperature,  stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, sort & rinse dry beans, then place in a  heavy 4- to 5-quart saucepan. Add salt & 4 cups water; bring to a boil,  then cover, turn off heat & let stand 1 hour. Return to a boil; reduce  heat, cover & simmer 1-1/2 hours until almost tender, adding more water as  necessary. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet; add chiles & cook until  browned. Set aside. Drain beef, reserve marinade. Melt remaining 1/2 cup  butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add beef & cook until well  browned, stirring as needed. Add beef, reserved marinade, chiles & broth to  beans. (If using canned beans, drain & rinse, then combine with beef,  marinade, chiles & broth). Cover & simmer 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until beans  are very tender & meat is almost tender. Then add bell peppers & simmer  15-30 minutes longer until peppers & beef are tender. Following package  directions, cook noodles in boiling water just until tender to bite. Drain  well, mound on a platter & nestle beef stew in the middle for a very pretty  entree. Makes 6 to 8 servings.    From the <Hotter Than Hell!>, by Jane Butel, ISBN 0-89586-646-3  (0-89586-542-4 paperback).  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
