Basic Salsa
Jalapenos; diced fine, Serranos; diced fine, (our, Garlic; minced, Lime juice; we use bottled, Powdered celery leaves, Diced red onions, Kosher salt & fresh pepper, Peeled tomatoes; diced into, Fresh Cilantro, Diced bell peppers, 
If the taste of cilantro isnt for you, we have used Italian parsley when  cilantro wasnt available. Different flavor, but still good.    I include a few orange, white and yellow tomatoes for both color and  because they seem to thicken the salsa a bit. After chopping, add some  kosher salt, mix, then drain off the liquid and slowly simmer it to about  1/3 of its original volume, stirring often and watching carefully (Ive  burned it a couple of times). Add the cooked down juice back to the  tomatoes.    Mix it all together, adjust quantities and the spices. If more heat is  needed, I add hab sauce. Let it mellow and merge for a day or two in the  fridge. I have trouble waiting that long...    If we can it, we pressure can pints at ten pounds for 25 minutes.    Ive rambled on long enough, yes?    Hobby Farmer    FROM: Chile-Heads Digest & Mailing List    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 09, 98,
