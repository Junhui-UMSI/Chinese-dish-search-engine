Put the anchovies into a bowl of water and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the  bones and leave to dry on a paper towel. Marinate the rabbit in 3  tablespoons olive oil, the wine, lemon juice, 2 crushed cloves garlic,  vegetables, herbs, and salt and pepper. Leave for 6 hours to overnight.    Take the rabbit out of the marinade, pat dry with a cloth or paper towel  and toss each piece in seasoned flour. Heat the remaining oil in a good  heavy frying pan. When hot throw in the pounded chili and brown the rabbit  briskly. Place the rabbit in an iron casserole. Pour the marinade into the  hot frying pan, bring rapidly to the boil and transfer to the casserole.  Cook in a preheated oven at 325 degrees of 45 minutes.    Chop up the anchovies, capers and garlic and simmer in 1/4 pint of the  rabbit liquid for 10 minutes. Add this to the casserole for a final  amalgamation. Check seasoning and garnish with chopped parsley. Some boiled  new potatoes or fresh noodles are a good accompaniment.
