From: Wendy Lockman <wlockman@ra1.randomc.com>    Date: Sun, 21 Apr 1996 15:41:22 -0400  My suggestion: Mash one banana into a measuring cup. Measure an equal  amount of peanut butter.    Mash very ripe bananas into a smooth paste. Mix in peanut butter.  Chill  well. Drop 2 Tbsp. onto one square graham cracker, cover with second graham  cracker square. Freeze until ready to use.    1 serving 188 calories, 1 starch, 1 med. fat meat, 1 fat exchange 20 grams  carbohydrate, 7 grams protein, 11 grams fat, 118 mg sodium    Adapted from Exchanges for All Occasions by Marion Franz, 1993 edition  Shared but not tested by Elizabeth Rodier, Jan 94.
