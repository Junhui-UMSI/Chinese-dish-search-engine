Slice peppers and onions  paper thin and combine in a large stone pickling crock, stainless steel  soup pot or other large non-reactive vessal.    Mix salt and ice. Gently mix with vegetables. Cover crock with weighted  lid. (I use several canning jars filled with water on top of a plate).    Let sit 3 hours, then drain well.    Combine sugar, spices, and vinegar, until sugar is dissolved. Pour over  vegetables in large steel or enamel kettle.    Bring to boil over *low* heat.    Pour into hot clean canning jars and seal immediately.
