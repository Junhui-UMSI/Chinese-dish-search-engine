Perfumed Bath Powder
Orrisroot powder, CHEAPER AND BETTER, Several drops perfume or, Cornstarch, Rice flour, 
Easy and inexpensive. Clouds of fragrance. Rice powder is available from  health food stores and orrisroot powder from a pharmacy.    Mix all and store the powder in a tightly closed tin for 1 WEEK so that the  orrisroot powder will absorb the scent. Transfer to other containers of  your choice if desired.    Ideas: Can be sprinkled from the kind of big shaker that is normally used  in the kitchen. For a special gift, cover a box with an antique style of  paper, add a pretty puff topped with a fancy bow.    Variations: An especially nice powder can be made by omitting any fragrance  from the recipe, and adding 1/2t vanilla to the powder and 1-2 vanilla  beans. Store in a tightly closed tin. Or, sprinkle a cup of rose petals  into the mixture, cover, and let the roses scent the powder. 24 oz Typed by  Sherilyn Schamber    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #104 by Jessica Wildes <jessann@texas.net>  on Apr 14, 1997
