Waffle Cookies
Cocoa, Vanilla, Granulated sugar, Butter or margarine, FROSTING, Eggs, salt, Flour, 
Beat together sugar and butter until creamy. Beat eggs with vanilla and  stir into butter mixture. Sift together dry ingredients and stir into  creamed mixture. Batter will be quite stiff.    Drop a heaping teaspoonful of batter into each section of a hot waffle  iron. Close lid and bake one to 1 1/2 minutes. Do not allow cookies to cook  until crisp. Cookies will burn if not removed promptly. Use fork to remove  cookies and place on racks to cool.    Immediately close lid of waffle iron to reheat, one to two minutes.  Meanwhile frost just baked cookie while warm, using recipe below or your  favourite frosting. Re-open waffle iron and repeat procedure. Continue  until all batter is used. Cookies will have ragged edges characteristic of  the waffle iron. Blend together, 1 cup confectioners sugar, one tablespoon  butter, one teaspoon vanilla, two tablespoons cocoa and enough cream or  milk to make a smooth, spreadable frosting.
