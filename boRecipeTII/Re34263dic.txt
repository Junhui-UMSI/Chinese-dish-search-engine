Place  flank steaks in shallow pan (flank steaks are best if they are tenderized  first).  Pour sauce over steaks covering them well. Refrigerate for at  least 12 hours.  Remove steaks from basting sauce and cook over grill for  about 3-5 minutes per side. Baste with additional sauce as desired.    Posted to MealMaster Recipes List, Digest #139
