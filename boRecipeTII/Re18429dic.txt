Vickis Noggin-Knockin Eggnog
Sugar, Bourbon, Nutmeg, Milk, whole, Dark rum, Eggs, Brandy, Heavy cream, 
Combine liquors.  Beat yolks until pale and lemon-colored (I do it in a  food processor).  Add sugar a little at a time, beating till sugar is  dissolved and mixture is thick.  Slowly pour mixture in a fine stream into  the liquor, beating constantly. Beat in milk. (Food processor bowl wont  hold it all.)    Beat cream until stiff.  Beat egg whites until they are stiff; fold  carefully into whipped cream.  Slowly fold in liquor until blended. Chill.  Top with grated nutmeg.    Vickis notes:    *  The cream *will* rise to the top.  Have to beat husband away with a  stick to guard it, whereupon I whisk the cream back in before I serve  seconds.  I know, Ill probably die of salmonella poisoning... but what a  way to go!    *  Will need 1 pint of cream, 1 pint of Meyers dark rum, and 1/2 pint each  of Jim Beam bourbon and E&J brandy.
