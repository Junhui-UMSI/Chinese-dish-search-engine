White Chocolate Mousse in Caramel Basket
Egg, Cane sugar cubes, Kumquats, Cream of tartar, White chocolate, Egg yolk, Whipping cream, Gelatine, Caster (granulated) sugar, Grand Marnier, 
Mousse: Melt the chocolate in a bowl over water. Separate egg, whisk white  until stiff but not dry. Whisk in caster sugar. Fold in the two egg yolks.  Whisk the cream until it just holds its shape. Dissolve the gelatine in 1  tbsp of boiling water. Fold the melted choc, then the cream, Grand Marnier  & gelatine into the egg mixture. Chill the mousse in the fridge.    Baskets: Well oil the outside of a 4in diameter glass basin. Make the  caramel by placing the cane sugar, tartar and 2 tbsp of water in a small  heavy saucepan over a low heat until dissolved. Do not stir. Turn up the  heat and boil rapidly without stirring until pale golden. Remove from heat  and stand pan in cold water while caramel continues to cook and becomes a  shade darker. Drizzle caramel over the basin to form basket (youre aiming  for a filigree effect). Return remaining caramel + a little water to low  heat to dissolve. Slice Kumquats, remove pips an poach in caramel for 10  mins, cool.    Divide mousse between baskets and top with glazed kumquats.  Serve chilled.
