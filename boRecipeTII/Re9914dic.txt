Chocolate chips, Margarine, Vanilla, Powdered sugar, Chex cereal, Butterscotch chips, Chunky peanut butter, 
submitted by: sgjg6566@usa.pipeline.com (Julie, Michigan, USA)  Hi everyone, this is a fun one Ive made for my kids (and the big kids  too!)    Place cereal in a large bowl and set aside. In microwave melt both chips,  peanut butter and margarine until smooth. Add vanilla and pour over the  cereal and stir til coated. Place cereal mixture and the powdered sugar in  paper bags and shake until all are coated. Spread out on wax paper to set.    Store in any container or paper bag and it usually makes between 8-9 cups.
