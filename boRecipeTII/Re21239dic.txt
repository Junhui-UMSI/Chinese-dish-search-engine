Ukrainian Cheese Curds
Skim milk, Salt, Buttermilk, 
This was sent to the Chicago Sun TImes by Ivanna Harasovaka:    Pour one gallon skim milk, one quart buttermilk, and two tablespoons of  salt into a large enamel pot. Mix well. Cover and let stand for 48 hours.  Put the pot on the stove with a very small flame for one hour. It should be  warm but it should not boil. Put a colander lined with cheesecloth over  another pot and pour the contents through the colander. Let drain for a few  hours.
