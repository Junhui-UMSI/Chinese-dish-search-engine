Undescended Twinkies
;Boiling Water, Pineapple juice, Twinkies, 7-Up, Orange Jell-O; (2 pkgs), Vanilla Ice Cream; Softened, 
Dissolve Jell-O in boiling water.  Add pineapple juice, ice cream and 7-Up.  Mix thoroughly (In a blender if necessary to dissolve ice cream), and pour  into a deep pan, approximately 9-inches square.  Chill until mixture begins  to set.  Lay Twinkies, flat side down, in two rows of four across the top  of the chilled gelatin. If the gelatin is properly chilled, it will resist  the Twinkies.  You will push them in and they will slowly rise. Remember  you dont want them buried. Just semi-decended in the ooze. Chill until  fully set and serve.
