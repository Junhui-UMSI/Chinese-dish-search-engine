Wild Mushroom and Toasted Walnut Crostini
Extra virgin olive oil (3 to, Soy sauce, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Garlic, Walnuts, toasted and finely, Nonfat sour cream, Chopped Italian parsley, Green onions, thinly sliced, Sherry, Mixed fresh wild mushrooms, Lowfat cream cheese, Baguette, CROSTINI, 
Heat a heavy bottomed saute pan over medium for approximately 20-30  seconds. (The objective is to heat the pan enough before adding oil so the  vegetables wont stick). Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and tip pan to coat  the bottom. Quickly add garlic and green onions and saute for 1-2 minutes  then remove and reserve. Add remaining oil and mushrooms, shaking pan  regularly. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until mushrooms release their juices.  Remove from heat and cool.    Meanwhile, place green onions, garlic and remaining ingredients except  walnuts and parsley in the bowl of a food processor. Mix until smooth and  creamy. Stir into the cooled mushrooms, adding the walnuts and parsley as  you mix the ingredients together.    Makes approximately 4 cups.    FOR CROSTINI: Preheat oven to 375#161#F. Slice bread into 1/4 inch  thickness. Lightly brush with olive oil on one side and place oiled side up  on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn over to lightly brown the  other side.    Remove and cool completely before storing. Will make enough for this picnic  plus leftovers.  Notes: This recipe lends itself well to a picnic because it can be made a  couple days ahead and can be packed easily. If you can not find any type of  wild mushroom, then use chopped portabellas or the white button mushrooms.    Serving Ideas: Serve as part of a Mediterranean Fall Picnic.    Nutr.
