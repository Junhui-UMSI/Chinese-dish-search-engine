(Thai Chicken in Lemon Grass Soup) This is from Charmaine Solomons newest  publication: THAI COOKBOOK.      TO MAKE PEPPER AND CORIANDER PASTE: This is a basic Thai flavoring and will  make about one cup which you can store in your fridge. You will use about  one tablespoon of it in the Tom Yum Gai. In a dry skillet, dry roast about 1 tb whole black peppercorns for a minute or two. In your blender whizz up the peppercorns together with 2 or 3 garlic cloves, 2 tsp salt, 2 tbs lemon juice, and a big bunch of fresh coriander (cilantro) which you have coarsely chopped, stems and roots included (about 2 cups).      TO MAKE THE SOUP: Whack each drumstick in two. Whizz up the garlic, chilies, and 1 tb Pepper and Coriander Paste together in your blender, and mix  with the chicken. Allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Place the stock, lime leaves (or zest), onions, galangal, lemon grass, and sugar in a large  saucepan together with the chicken and simmer about 30 minutes or until  chicken is tender. Add fish sauce and lime juice. Adjust flavorings for spicy and sour to your taste. Serve garnished with coriander and sliced  chillies.      NOTES: Be aware that the fresh chillies used for this recipe are very acidic. Thoroughly wash your hands after handling. DO NOT rub your eyes  until you have washed your hands.
