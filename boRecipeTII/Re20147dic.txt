Vanilla Rum Creme Anglaise
Sugar, Half-and-half, Dark rum, Vanilla bean, Egg yolks, 
In a small heavy saucepan bring half and half just to a boil with vanilla  bean and remove pan from heat. Scrape seeds from bean with a knife into  half-and-half, reserving pod for another use if desired. In a bowl whisk  together yolks, sugar and a pinch of salt and whisk in hot half-and- half  in a stream. Return custard to pan and cook over moderately low heat,  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until thickened (170 degrees on a  candy thermometer), but do not let boil. Pour sauce through a fine sieve  into a bowl and cool, stirring occasionally. Stir in rum. Chill sauce,  covered, until very cold, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.
