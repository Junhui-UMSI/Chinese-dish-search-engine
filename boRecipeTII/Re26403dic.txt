(Some small pieces should remain.) Add  enough water to make 2 cups. (If youre careful, you can microwave the  tomato mixture to about 100 degrees to promote yeast growth.)    Add margarine, salt, sugar, chili powder, cumin seed, corn meal and yeast  mixture.    Stir in 5 cups flour to make stiff dough. Knead in enough more flour to  keep from sticking.    Let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down, and let rise again.    Chop onions and chiles and saute in a tablespoon of oil.    Knead onions and chiles gently into dough. Form into loaves. Let rise until  almost doubled.    Brush loaves with egg wash, and sprinkle with some more cumin seed.    Bake 30 to 35 minutes at 375 degrees until browned, and sounds hollow when  tapped on the bottom.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #240 by The Old Bear <oldbear@arctos.com>  on Dec 17, 1997
