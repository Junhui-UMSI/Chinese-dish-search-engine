This is used for beef and other robust dishes.    Chop the shallots, garlic and lemon grass. Heat a heavy frying pan and add  the coriander and cumin seeds after 2-3 minutes. Dry roast until they  darken, shaking the pan to prevent burning. Allow to cool, then grind to a  powder with the peppercorns. Remove the seeds from the chilies and chop.  Pound or process all the ingredients to a smooth paste.    * For Green Curry Paste, follow the recipe for Red curry paste, using fresh  green chilies instead of dried red and adding 2 tbsp chopped coriander  leaves.
