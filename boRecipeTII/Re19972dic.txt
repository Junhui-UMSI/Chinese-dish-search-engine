Apple Butter Muffins
Salt, Vanilla, Raisins, Flour, Honey, Apple butter, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Cinnamon, Brown sugar, Skim milk, Eggs, Ginger, Butter, 
Preheat oven to 400 F.    In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients (the first 7 ingredients) and make  a well in the center. In smaller bowl, combine wet ingredients (the next 6  ingredients). Pour wet mixture into the "well" of the dry ingredients and  stir just to combine (10-15 strokes). Fold in raisins with as few strokes  as possible.    Spoon batter into 12 muffin cups (if you dont use muffin liners, spray the  pan with cooking spray).    Bake 20-25 minutes, until cake tester comes out clean.  Remove muffin tin  to cooling rack and cool 5 mins. before removing muffins from tin. (Do  *not* let muffins cool completely in the tin.)
