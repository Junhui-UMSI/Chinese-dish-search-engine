(I do not use salt or margarine in the preparation of the rice.)  While the rice is cooking chop the onions and garlic. Saute slowly until  onions are just tender.  Add the ground beef and brown. Cook onions and  ground beef about 7 minutes.  Drain off the fat. Return to medium heat.  Separately mix the broccoli cheese soup and milk. Stir until creamy in  texture. At this point test for taste.  I usually add table grind black  pepper and salt (less that 1/2 teaspoon). When the ground beef is ready,  add the rice and broccoli, and soup mixture, tossing carefully. Put the  mixture in to a 9 x 9, or 9 x 13 casserole dish. Sometimes I top this with  seasoned bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Bake about 35 minutes.    Recipe By     :    Posted to Master Cook Recipes List, Digest #90
