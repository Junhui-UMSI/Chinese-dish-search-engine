1. Dice the potatoes into large chunks. Leave the skin on if the potatoes  have thin skin. Cook the potatoes in boiling water until they are done.    2. While the potatoes are cooking, in a separate pot, add 1 cup of  red-lentils to 2 cups boiling water. Reduce heat, add curry powder and  salt, simmer until lentils are done and they have absorbed all the water.  This should take about 20 minutes. You can tell when your lentils are done  by squeezing one between your thumb and index finger, if it totally  squashes, it is done. Dont forget the curry powder! The lentils should  take on a pretty yellow color.    3. Get a large bowl. Drain any extra water from the lentils, put the  potatoes and the lentils into the bowl. Add tomatoes, carrots, onion,  celery, bread crumbs, olive oil, pepper, cumin (Go easy on the Cumin!).  Mash the whole thing Together. You may use a fork to mash the potatoes into  smaller pieces. Dont even think about using a hand blender or any other  electric kitchen appliance. Mashing it by hand will blend the ingredients  nicely. Do not overdo it. When you are finished you should have a pliable  mass speckled with tomato, celery, and potato.    4. Get a large baking dish. Mold the mass into a rectangle 1.5 to 2 inches  thick. You now have a lentil loaf. Sprinkle a generous quantity of paprika  on top of the loaf. This is very important for color. Sprinkle a generous  quantity of sesame seeds on top of the loaf. Press the seeds in.    5. Preheat oven to 350. Cover the baking dish with foil. Bake at 350 for 45  minutes. For the last 10 to 15 minutes, remove the foil so that the surface  of the loaf gets some color.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
