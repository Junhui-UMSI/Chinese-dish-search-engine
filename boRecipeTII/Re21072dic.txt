Preparation: Trim and discard fat from beef. Cut beef across the grain into  1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces. Combine marinade ingredients in a medium-size  bowl. Add beef; stir to coat. Set aside for 30 minutes.    Cut carrot, bell pepper, and celery into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces.  Thinly slice onion.  Set vegetables aside separately.    Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.    Cooking: Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2  inches. Place over high heat until oil reaches about 375 degrees F. Add  beef, half at a time, and deep fry for 1 minute until browned, turning  occasionally.  Lift out and drain on paper towels; set aside. Cook  remaining beef.    Remove all but 2 Tablespoons oil from wok.  Reheat oil over high heat until  hot.  Add carrot and onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add  bell pepper and celery; stir-fry for 1 more minute. Stir in sauce and beef.  Cook and toss until well mixed.    Tips: There should be just enough sauce to coat ingredients. It is easier  to slice beef thinly if it is partially frozen.    From: Martin Yan The Chinese Chef, Copyright 1985, ISBN 0-385-23412-0
