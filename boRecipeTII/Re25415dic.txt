Tortilla Espanola (Potato Omelette, Spanish Style)
Eggs, White pepper, garlic, Yellow onions, Extra virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, New potatoes, 
Leaving the skins on, slice the new potatoes thinly.  Peel, split, and  slice  onions. In a large saute pan, heat olive oil (the best you can afford).  You  need a good quarter inch in your pan.  Saute potatoes and onions and  garlic on  a low flame until the potatoes are soft and the onions are translucent.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place the potato mxture in a greased round  cake pan, spring form pan, cast iron skillet or terra-cotta baking dish.  If  you use something small, make two.  Season eggs and pour over potatoes.  Bake  20 minutes at 350F and then start testing. When the middle is set and the  top  slightly brown, its done. Let set 5 minutes, run a knife around the  outside  and invert onto a round platter. Serve at room temperature.
