Cream margarine and sugar together and add the  banana mix, stirring well. In a separate bowl stir together the dry  ingredients. Add to the banana mix and stir in the dates and nuts if  desired.  The dough will be very stiff. Turn it into a greased loaf pan and  bake for 30 to 45 minutes. To test for doneness, insert a knife into the  loaf; if it comes out clean, the bread is done. Makes 1 loaf. Source:  Robertson, Laurel, Carol Flinders, and Bronwen Godfrey, _Laurels           Kitchen_, Nilgiri Press:  Petaluma, California, 1976, p. 308.
