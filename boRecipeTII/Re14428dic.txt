Whole Wheat Loaf
Salt, Oatmeal flakes, Brown sugar, Whole wheat flour, Baking soda, Buttermilk, Double-acting baking powder, Egg, All-purpose white flour, 
I would like to thank every one who has replied to my request for things to  make with cooked oatmeal. In appreciation, I am including a wonderful  recipe for a very delicious bread which can be ready for the oven in no  more than 5 minutes. Ive made lots of times, and people just love it. Its  from a cookbook called "Diane Clement At The Tomato". According to the  book, The Tomato is (or was, if it no longer exists) a Vancouver  restaurant. The cookbook, I suspect, had a very small circulation as I have  rarely seen it in book stores. Anyway, here it is:    In large bowl, combine all the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk  the egg and the buttermilk. Add to the dry ingredients, stirring to form a  ball. The dough will be slightly soft. Dust a board generously with large  oatmeal flakes, turn out the dough, and knead about 10 times to cover with  the flakes and form a round ball. Cut a cross lightly on top of the loaf  and place on a buttered cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 45 to  55 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when you tap the bottom of the loaf.  Serve warm.    You can vary the batter by adding raisins, apricots, sunflower seeds, and a  little cinnamon for a delightful fruit bread.
