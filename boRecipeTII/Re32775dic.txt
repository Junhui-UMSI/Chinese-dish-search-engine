PREPARE YOUR FAVORITE PIE crust and chill it in the refrigerator for 20  minutes. Preheat oven to 425F. Combine sweet potato and eggs in a mixer;  beat until incorporated. Add all other ingredients, except for cream, and  mix until smooth. Pour mixture into the pie crust and place the pie in the  oven to bake for 10 minutes. Lower temperature to 350 F and bake another 45  minutes or until mixture is set. Remove from oven and allow to cool to room  temperature. Accompany the pie with lightly whipped cream.
