Zabaglione Tarts with Fresh Berries
Light frozen whipped, Keebler ready-crust single, (4 serving) of sugar-free, Skim milk, Marsala wine, Fresh strawberries; hulled, Additional frozen topping, 
In Blender, or with a wire whisk, combine milk, wine, and pudding. Cover  and blend on low until well mixed and slightly thickened. Pour into bowl,  and fold in whipped topping. Divide evenly among tart shells, arrange  strawberries on top of each one, and refrigerate until serving time. Top  with additional whipped topping if desired.    The book figured these at 5 grams of fat for each, but my crusts said 6  grams, so I figured with the lite Cool Whip that each one was about 8  grams. Not too bad since I served it with the following Ham Stew which only  has about 3 grams per serving, and a cornbread that had only about 1 gram  per serving. The whole dinner was only 12 or 13 grams!    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n016 by jneger@juno.com (Nicki A Eger) on Jan  17, 1998
