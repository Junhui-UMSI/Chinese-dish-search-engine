Suzys Favorite Brownie Muffins
Granulated sugar, Baking Powder, Chocolate Frosting, Pecans, Salt, Unsalted butter, Eggs, lightly beaten, OPTIONAL, Vanilla extract, All-purpose flour, Sweet Baking Chocolate, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease sixteen muffin cups or use paper/foil  liners    In a large mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, salt and baking powder.    In a small saucepan, melt butter and chocolate together over very low heat.  Stir chocolate mixture into flour mixture.    Add eggs and vanilla extract and mix together just until ingredients are  evenly moistened. Fold in the pecans.    Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each cup      3/4    full.    Bake for 20 min., or until springs slightly to the touch.    When cool can be frosted if desired or sift Confectioners Sugar over the  tops.    Optional: I like to add a 1/2 cup of chocolate mini-chips to the batter  when adding the nuts.
