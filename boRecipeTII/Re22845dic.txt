Apricot-Ginger Cranberry Sauce
INGREDIENTS:, Fresh (or thawed frozen), Dried apricots, each cut, Plus 1 tbsp. sugar, Cranberry juice, Minced, pared, fresh ginger, 
Soak  the  dried  apricots  in the cranberry  juice  in  a  medium saucepan for  ten minutes.   Add the  remaining ingredients and  stir them well. Cook,  stirring occasionally, over medium heat until the  cranberries have popped and the syrup has thickened  slightly - that should take about 5 minutes.    Let  the sauce cool to room temperature,  then  refrigerate  it (covered) until its *cold*.  It can be stored in  the fridgipater for up to a week. Transfer the sauce  to a serving dish and serve while its still cold.  The colder the better, so long as it isnt frozen.
