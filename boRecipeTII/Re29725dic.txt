Pinch of salt, All purpose flour, Sugar, (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted, 
Preheat oven to 325F. Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in bowl  until well combined. Sift flour and salt into butter mixture. Using  fingertips, rub mixture until moist clumps form. Gently knead until soft  dough forms. Divide dough in half. Press out 1 dough piece to 9 1/2-inch  round, about 1/4 inch thick. Roll lightly with rolling pin to smooth top.  Using 3-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 8 cookies. Reserve scraps.  Repeat pressing, rolling and cutting with remaining dough piece. Gather  dough scraps together. Press out dough scraps to form round and cut out  additional cookies.    Arrange cookies on 2 large baking sheets. Pierce each cookie several times  with fork. Bake until pale golden, about 12 minutes. Cool slightly.  Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely.
