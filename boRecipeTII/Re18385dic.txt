Very Rich, Very Thin Chocolate Lace Cookies
Egg, Salt, Sugar, Chocolate-unsweetened, Vanilla, Butter, Flour, Baking Powder, 
Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler. Combine with  egg and rest of ingredients.   Drop by scant teaspoonfuls on greased cookie sheets. The finished cookies  will be 3 to 4 inches in diameter so space them accordingly. Bake in  preheated oven of 325~ for about 12 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent  burning.  When nearly cool, remove from the cookie sheet with spatuala. (I  use the metal type.Hint-press under the cookie with pressure against the  sheet and they remove easily without crumbling) Place on racks to cool  completely.
