Avocado-And-Scallop Ceviche
avocado, White mushrooms, Fresh Lemon Juice, salt and pepper, Fresh lime juice, Black Pepper, Garlic, chives, Salt, Sea scallops, Peanut oil, Fresh chives, Green peppercorns, Vegetable oil, 
COMBINE THE LIME JUICE, oil, peppercorns, salt and pepper together in a  glass or ceramic bowl. Stir in the scallops, cover and refrigerate for at  least 4 hours while they marinate. They should become opaque in this time.  Mash the avocado until almost smooth, then add it along with the chives or  scallions to the marinating scallops (do not drain them) and mix well. Set  aside for at least 1/2 hour, refrigerated. About half an hour before  serving the scallops, remove the stems from the mushrooms and wipe them to  remove any dirt. Combine the vegetable oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and  pepper in a small bowl, and brush the insides of the mushrooms liberally  with the mixture. Just before serving, drain the caps and fill with the  scallop mixture. Garnish with additional chives, if desired.
