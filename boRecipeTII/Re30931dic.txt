1.  Lightly grease and flour a 10" spring form pan.   2.  Mix all the ingredients together in a mixer until well blended.   3.  Pour into the pan and bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for  about 50 minutes.   4.  Let  cool on a rack for 25 minutes before removing from the pan. NOTE:  This makes a great adult Halloween cake.  Frost with orange cream cheese  frosting and decorate like a jack-o-lantern. And it is EASY!
