If using dried chick-peas, place the soaked peas in a large stock pot with  the water and bay leaf and simmer, covered, over low heat 2 1/2 hours, or  until tender.  Drain, reserve the cooking liquied, and discard the bay  leaf.  There should be 3 cups of liquid; if necessary, add some water to  make that amount.  If using cooked or canned chick-peas, use 4 cups water  in place of the reserved cooking liquid. In a large, heavy casserole, cook  the salt pork, stirring over low heat 4 to 5 minutes. Add the onion,  garlic, bell pepper, chorizo, and bacon, and cook over low heat until the  onions are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, sherry,  rice, reserved cooking liquied, and chick-peas, and stir to blend. Cook  over medium-high heat until most of the liquied has been absorbed and small  craters appear over the top of the rice, 10 to 25 minutes. Reduce the heat  to low, stir the rice with a fork, cover, and cook until the rice is  tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the salt pork and serve.
