Quinoa Corn Chowder
Quinoa, Carrots, Parsley, , Water, Milk, Fresh ground black pepper, Butter, Corn, Onions, Salt, Potato, white, 
Simmer quinoa, potato, carrot, celery onion until tender (About 15 min).  Add corn. Bring back to boil and simmer another 5 minutes or so. Add Milk.  Bring jujst to boil.  Season to taste.  Garnish with parsley and dab of  butter.  Serves 6-8 (with lots else for supper-main dish 2-3.) I used a  potato that did not break down and whole kernel corn.  One or other should  be mushy to give a creamy texture. I think the flavor will be fine this  evening, but it was a little bland freshly made.  This is partly because of  no butter which adds so much flavor.It was indeed fine for lunch next day.
