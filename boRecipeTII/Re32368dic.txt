Barley Risotto with Roasted Tomatoes and Nicoise Olives
Pearl  barley, Tomatoes, Onion, olive oil, Water, Chicken stock, Salt, Butter, Parmesan cheese, Heavy cream, Nicoise olives, 
Heat the oven to 300 degrees.  Put the halved tomatoes, cut-side up, on a  baking sheet.  Dry the tomatoes in the oven until shriveled but still  juicy, not hard and dry, about 2 hours. Let cool and then cut into 1/2-inch  pieces.    In a medium saucepan, bring the water and stock to a boil.  Remove from the  heat and keep covered.    In another medium saucepan, heat the oil over moderate heat.  Add the onion  and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.    Add the barley and stir to coat.  Add about a third of the hot stock  mixture and cook at a gentle boil, stirring occasionally, until absorbed.  Add another third of the stock and cook, stirring frequently, until  absorbed.  Add the remaining stock and the salt and cook, stirring  frequently, until the barley is tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes total  cooking time.  Any stock that has not been absorbed should be thickened by  the starch from the barley.    Stir the barley vigorously to make the texture creamier.  If it is dry, add  more water.  Stir in the butter, Parmesan, the cream, if using, and three  quarters of both the tomatoes and the olives.  Serve the barley risotto  topped with the remaining tomatoes and olives.
