I dont know if this is exactly the Pepper Steak recipe requested earlier  by I. Chaudhary, but its one of our favorites. We eat this practically  year-round and its good hot or cold.  Makes terrific sandwiches the next  day.  My mom found this recipe years ago in a magazine - Womans Day or  Family Circle, I think - that featured celebrity chefs.  This was from Alan  Ladd - and I probably just dated myself with that one (Im really not that  old!).  For those who dont know who Alan Ladd was, he was a great movie  star - best movie was "Shane" - at least a three hanky.  Anyway, heres the  recipe.    Sprinkle meat with tenderizer, pierce with a fork (make lots of pierces so  the marinade soaks thru), and place in baking dish.  Mix rest of  ingredients, except peppercorns, in a bowl and pour over meat.  Lift meat  up so marinade gets under it and can soak through. Marinate overnight (I  usually start this in the evening and let it marinate overnight and all the  next day) in refrigerator, turning frequently.  When ready to grill or  broil, remove meat from marinade and pound half the peppercorns into each  side.  Broil to desired doneness.  Slice meat thinly and on the diagonal  and serve.    We always cook this on our grill outside.  It has a wonderful taste - very  peppery and if you like it spicier, add more peppercorns.  Ive given up  measuring them.  Hint:  I take whole peppercorns, put them in a zippered  heavy-duty plastic bag, and pound them with my meat mallet.  Weve also  tried different red wines for the marinade - burgandy, sangria, etc.  And  get a bottle large enough to enjoy some while youre grilling!
