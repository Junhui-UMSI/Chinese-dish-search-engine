Many Spinach Dip recipes have been posted recently. Some of them were  actually quite similar to this. I had an recipe that was almost the same as  this, and used it for every party I went to. I needed an appetizer to take  w/ me to an easter dinner, so I grabbed the Pumpernickel loaf out of my  freezer, and whipped up a slightly different version than my regular. The  new recipe disappeared faster than my old one! :P~~~ Ssome people call it a  Rip-&-Dip, because thats what you do. I used a small, round loaf of  pumpernickel bread, hollowed it out, used the bits of bread for dipping,  and used the loaf like a bowl. If you need a larger amount, simply doulbe  the dip recipe, and either use a small loaf of pumpernickel and one of  sourdough, or use a large one of either. Here is the small dip recipe,  which nearly fills the small loaf:    Squeeze all the liquid out of the spinach until it is like a ball. Get out  your sharpest knife and chop it for a minute or so. Sift through the soup  mix to get to the powder at the bottom, and add 1/2 the pkg. to all the  other ingredients. Mix it up really well, and try to pour it all into an  empty sour cream or cottage cheese container. Find room in the fridge for  the dip, and leave it there at least an hour, or better yet: keep there  overnight when you can grab it and the bread, throw them in a bag, head to  the car and go! The longer its in the fridge, the more intense the flavour  gets. My sister hates onions, and she couldnt even tell they were in  there! :o) Hope you like the recipe!
