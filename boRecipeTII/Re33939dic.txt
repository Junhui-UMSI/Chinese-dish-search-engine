Sweet Banana Bread
Fresh milk, banana, Sugar, Margarine, Salt, Yeast, Egg yolk, Bread flour, 
I put these ingredients in the machine in this order and select  medium-white.    If the banana is very ripe--which is why I use this recipe so often--then  you need to cut down on the yeast somewhat or the bread rises all over the  place!!! Ive also substituted applesauce for the margarine and its great.  Lets see....also is great with chopped pecans or cinnamon or cloves  added.....its great!
