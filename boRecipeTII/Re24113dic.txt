Let stand 10  minutes. Combine the lukewarm milk with the dissolved yeast and 5 cups  flour. Beat until smooth. Cover and let rise in a warm place until light  and bubbly, approx. 45 minutes.    Add beaten eggs, sugar, melted butter and salt. Mix thoroughly. Stir in  enough flour to make a medium soft dough. Knead until smooth and satiny.  Cover and let rise 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and let rise another 45 minutes.  Shape into round loaves. Decorate the loaves with same dough. The central  ornament on paska is usually the cross. Some homemakers decorate paska with  breaded rolls. Be sure to grease pans well.    Set the loaves in a warm place until almost double. Brush with melted  butter. Bake in a 400 degree F. oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the  temperature to 375 degrees F. and continue baking for 30 minutes.  Yield:  six small or four to five larger loaves.
