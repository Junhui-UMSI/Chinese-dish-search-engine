Trillionaire Cookies
Finely chopped pecans, Semisweet chocolate chips, Caramel topping, Round butter flavored, 
I found this at the cookie site    http://www.cookierecipe.com/    I bet you could sprinkle coconut on top of the caramel mixture, dip the  bottoms as directed then squirt chocolate lines on top and have something  similar.    1 In a medium saucepan, combine caramel topping and pecans over medium  heat.    2 Stirring constantly, bring to a boil and cook 3 to 5 minutes longer or  until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and allow to cool 5 minutes.    3 Spoon about 1 1/2 teaspoons caramel mixture on top of each cracker.  Refrigerate 1 hour or until firm    4 In a small saucepan, melt chocolate chips over low heat, stirring  constantly. Remove from heat.    5 Using tongs, dip bottom of each cracker in chocolate. Transfer to waxed  paper and refrigerate 1 hour or until chocolate is firm. Can be stored in  an airtight container in the refrigerator.    Makes 3 dozen    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by Janie Derby <jaderby@startext.net> on Mar 20,  1998
