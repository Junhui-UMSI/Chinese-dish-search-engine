Angel Hair Pasta with Smoked Salmon and Dill
Lemon Peel, milk, Angel hair pasta, Capers, fresh dill, smoked salmon, Green Onions, Whipping cream, 
* Recipe says dont use low-fat or non-fat milk. I used 2% and it was fine.    Cook pasta in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still  firm to bite. Drain well; return to same pot.    Combine cream milk, dill, onions, capers, and lemon peel in heavy small  saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Add sauce to pasta; toss to  coat. Add salmon and toss to combine. Season with S&P and serve.    Makes 2 servings; can be doubled (Bon Appetit, April 1996)    Recipe by: Epicurious web site    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Kaye Sykes <kaye_sykes@NL.COMPUWARE.COM> on Dec  11, 1997
