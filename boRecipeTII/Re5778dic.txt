Pink Shrimp for 12 (Cocktail)
Mayo; homemade if possible, Grated horseradish or more, Salt, Cooked beet; minced, Headless shrimp; boiled with, Beet juice (to color the, Sour cream, Serve over lettuce, SAUCE, 
Note: *I prefer to use 1/4 cup of the court bouillon in which the shrimp  were cooked (make sauce and check before adding salt in this case) in place  of the beet juice, but the color isnt as pretty.    Good for a buffet. Can be pretty low fat with non-fat sour cream  (Land-0-Lakes is my favorite) and low or non fat mayo. (But you sacrifice a  lot of good flavor if you omit homemade mayo) Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by ddmmom@popalex1.linknet.net on Jul 10, 1997
