For the muffins, line 24 (2-1/2 inch) muffin pans with paper liners. Use a  non-pudding type cake mix. Place the cake mix in a large bowl along with  the peanut butter. Use an electric mixer at medium speed to mix until  coarse crumbs form. Continue with cake mix directions but omit the oil  called for on package. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling each half  full. Top each with 1 teaspoon jelly. Add enough batter to cover jelly,  filling each cup to 3/4 full. Bake in preheated 350-degree oven for 20  minutes or until cakes spring back when lightly touched. Cool in pan on  wire rack for 10 minutes. Frost if desired.    FROSTING: Place cocoa and margarine in large bowl. Using a mixer at medium  speed, beat cocoa and margarine until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar,  alternating with milk and vanilla. Beat in peanut butter until frosting is  fluffy.    Yields: 24 cupcakes and enough frosting for all.
