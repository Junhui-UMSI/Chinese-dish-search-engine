Winner Shere Case of Hickory Hills describes her cookie entry: "Holiday  preparation usually starts in September and continues until the night  before Christmas.  I have been doing this for almost 18 years, and each  year I add more recipes. This particular cookie, passed on to me by my  sister- in-law, Diana Forkash of Wisconsin, ranks among the favorites of  the family and friends. It looks absolutely gorgeous on a plate, tastes  wonderful and is  absolutely the easiest thing to make. There is no baking  time involved, and you can sit down on the job and enjoy doing them."    from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December  4, 1986  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #340    From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 11:32:57 +0000
