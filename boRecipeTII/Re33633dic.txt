Swedish Rice Pudding
Milk, (whole), Eggs, Cinnamon, Butter, Long grain rice, Sugar, Salt to taste, Vanilla, 
Butter a 11 x 8 x 3-inch casserole or pan (the dish/pan size is important,  dont use a larger pan or your custard layer will be too shallow); set  aside.    In the top of a double boiler, combine the rice and 1 cup of the milk.  Cover and cook over simmering water until the rice is tender, about 45  minutes. Pour into prepared pan.    Preheat oven to 375-degrees.    In a mixer bowl, lightly beat the eggs until frothy. Add the sugar,  vanilla, butter, salt and remaining milk and mix well. Pour over the rice  and sprinkle cinnamon liberally over the top; DO NOT stir in.    Place dish in a pan of hot water (about 1/2 way up the sides of the dish).  Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the pudding is slightly puffy and is firm  on top.    Remove from the hot water and cool on a rack.    Serve at room temperature or chilled (mine never lasts that long, I eat it  HOT! :) From: Linda Magee
