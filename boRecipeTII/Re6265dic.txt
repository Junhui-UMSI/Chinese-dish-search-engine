(Thai Steamed Fish with Basil)     * Sliced thinly-crosswise (use the base only, about 2 or 3 inches from the  root)    DIRECTIONS: Chop coarsely--the Galanga, lemon grass, onions, chilies and  soy beans in a blender or food processor (add a tbsp of water if  necessary). Wash, clean and pat dry the fish well. Cut 3-4 deep slits  crosswise on both sides and cover with the spice mixture pushing the  mixture into the slits. Place the dressed fish in a platter deep enough to  accommodate extra liquid when the fish is cooked.   Place the platter in the steamer. Sprinkle basils and Kaffir lime leaves.  Place 2 pieces of paper towels over the top but not on the fish to catch  any excess moisture while steaming. Cover and steam over high heat for 20  minutes or until fish is fully cooked. Serve immediately with cooked rice.   NOTE: All the listed ingredients can be found in any Thai grocery stores.
