V-8 Vegetable Soup

Sorry that this is not in meal master format, but it is coming from my  head. This is a vegetable soup my mother has made for years and I have done  the same. There was never a need to format it.    Place v-8 and bone or meat in a stock pot or large pan. Open all cans of  vegetables and drain juice into the stock pot. Refrigerate veggies until  later. Add chopped onion and celery. Cover and cook on low heat until meat  is tender and veggies are tender. Add the veggies and cook until heated  through. Invite the family to stop in on a cold day and eat all day long.  At least thats what we did. :) I dont know if this is it or not, but we  all loved it.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #261 by OrionLuver@eosinc.com (Mary L.  Taylor) on Tue, 24 Sep 1996.
