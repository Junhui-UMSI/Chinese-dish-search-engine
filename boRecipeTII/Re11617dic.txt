Raspberry Salsa
Cinnamon, Sugar, Serrano peppers; finely, Raspberries; fresh or frozen, Brown sugar, Chocolate syrup, Chopped pecans; toasted, Chipotle peppers; dried, Ground oregano, Salt, Water, 
Place chipotles in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil.  Cover, and boil until tender (about 15 minutes); drain. Set aside to cool.    Finely dice the rehydrated chipotles and combine with serranos, sugars,  salt, cinnamon, oregano, and water in a medium saucepan. Bring mixture to a  low boil. Cook until thickened slightly (about 7 or 8 minutes), stirring  frequently. Add raspberries, and cook until they start to break up but not  disintegrate. (You want the salsa to have a chunky texture.) Remove mixture  from heat, and stir in chocolate syrup and pecans. Chill thoroughly, and  serve over ice cream. Yields 3-1/2 cups.    NOTES : Mark Lashley, saucier, and Richard Wheatley, sous chef, both of  Central Market in Austin, created this unusual salsa reicpe especially for  the readers of "Texas Highways". The chefs say you can use it as a sauce  for meat or fish, or simply spoon it over ice cream (chocolate is a  winner).
