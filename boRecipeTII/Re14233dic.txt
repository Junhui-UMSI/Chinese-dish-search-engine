White Salad
cream cheese, crushed pineapple, canned, nuts, Whipped cream, lemon jello, 
Drain the pineapple and reserve juice; add enough water to the juice to  make 2 cups. Heat the liquid to a boil and add jello, mix until dissolved.    Chill until thick as syrup. Mash cream cheese and add to jello mixture. Mix  well (I use a mixer). Add whipped cream and nuts, mix well. Pour into a 9x       12    dish and chill well.    Note: the above recipe works very well with non-fat cream cheese nad  non-fat whipped cream.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Sue Plumley <splumley@CITYNET.NET> on Dec 18,  1997
