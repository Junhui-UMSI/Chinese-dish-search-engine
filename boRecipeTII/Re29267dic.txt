Baked Stuffed Eggplant
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Basil Leaves, Fresh parsley, Dried Red Pepper Flakes, Garlic, Eggplants, Mozzarella Cheese, Tomatoes, 
Preheat oven to 350F.    With a tablespoon, scoop out some of the pulp from the eggplant halves,  making sure not to break the skin. Place the eggplant halves on a large  platter and sprinkle generously with slat. Let stand about 20 minutes to  allow the salt to draw out the eggplants bitter juices. Pat the eggplant  dry with paper towels.    Dice the pulp of the eggplant and put it in a bowl with the tomatoes,  mozzarella, basil, parsley, garlic, and olive oil. Season with salt and  pepper flakes. Fill the eggplants cavities with this mixture.    Oil a baking dish lightly, and put the eggplant halves into the dish. Bake  until they are lightly golden, soft to the touvh, and easily pierced with  the tip of a thin knife, 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of the  eggplants. Serve hot or at room temperature.    NOTES:    This is from Biba Caggianos _Trattoria Cooking_ cookbook. It is easy to do  and can be doubled and frozen for an additional meal later on.    One of Bibas notes is that she will dice any leftover eggplant and toss it  quickly in a skillet with extra virgin olive oil and freshly diced tomatoes  and serve it over penne, shells, or rigatoni.
