Quick Cherry Angel Dessert
Angel food cake, Sour cream, cherry pie filling, instant vanilla, milk, 
Place half of cake pieces in a 9x9-inch pan. Spoon 2/3 of the pie filling  over cake. Top with remaining cake. Beat together pudding, sour cream &  milk. Spoon over cake. Garnish with remaining pie filling. Chill several  hours until firm & cut in squares. I vary this recipe and use banana  pudding sometimes. You can add your own changes, too. Serves 6-8.
