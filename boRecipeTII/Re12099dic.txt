Zombie Eyeballs
Paprika, olives, stuffed, Flour, butter, cheddar cheese, Salt, 
Perfect for Halloween hors doeurve. You can even freeze them ahead and  bake them in small batches. We like to use Jalapeno Jack cheese, as its  flecks of red and green peppers add a ghoulish visual effect.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.    Leave the butter or margarine out until soft. Combine it with the cheese in  a mixing bowl until well blended. In a different bowl, mix the flour,  paprika, and salt. Combine the two mixtures until completely blended  together. Teaspoon by teaspoon, form "eyeballs" around the olives. Place  them on ungreased baking sheets.    Bake for 12 to15 minutes.    Or freeze them on the baking sheets. When hard, place them in plastic bags  then thaw and bake them as needed. If successful, your guests will say  "Oooooo! GROSS!"
