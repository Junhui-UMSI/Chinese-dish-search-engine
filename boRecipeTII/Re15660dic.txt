This pickle is often confused with the similar-in-concept, but functionally  quite different, than gkwa kiaowan, a sweet & sour cooked relish.    Slice the cucumber in four lengthwise, then slice the pieces to segments  about an eighth of an inch thick.    Slice the tops of the chilis (green ones can be used if red are not  available, but Thais like the color contrast), and tap out any loose seeds,  and discard, then slice the chilis across into thin rounds. Slice the  shallots and water chestnuts.    Combine and serve.    This will keep 2 or 3 weeks in a referigerator. It is a traditional  accomaniment to snacks such as spring rolls, or to barbequed foods.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #144    Date: Wed, 30 Oct 1996 12:25:49 -0700    From: "Colonel I.F.K.
