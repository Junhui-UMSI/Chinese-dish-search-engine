Ask butcher to remove spine bones from racks of lamb. Cut out meat halfway  down between rib bones, discarding fat from tops of racks. Rub lamb with  garlic, mint, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves. Combine with olive oil in  bowl. Marinate in refrigerator for 2 days or longer. Season lamb with salt  and pepper. Cut each rack into halves and wrap rib bones with buttered  paper to prevent burning. Place in roasting pan. Roast at 400 to 450  degrees for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Combine  mustard and wine in small bowl; mix    well. Remove buttered paper from rib bones. Brush outside of racks with  mustard mixture; dip in bread crumbs. Stand lamb in same roasting pan and  fold rib bones between each other. Roast at 350 degrees for 10 minutes or  until crumbs are brown. Serve standing on platter; garnish with additional  mint.
