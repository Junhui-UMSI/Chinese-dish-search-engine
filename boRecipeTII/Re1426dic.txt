Entenmanns Fat-Free Oatmeal Raisin Coookies
Molasses, Egg whites, Raisins, Vanilla, Light brown sugar; packed, Granulated sugar, Nonfat Dry Milk Powder, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, Quick-Cooking Oats, All-purpose flour, 
Put molasses, egg whites and raisins into blender and blend on high speed  just to mince but not to puree (about 5-10 seconds). Empty mixture into  medium mixing bowl. With mixer beat in on medium speed each of the  remaining ingredients, beating well after each addition, adding both the  oats and flour in small portions. Switch to mixing spoon if dough becomes  too stiff for mixer. Lightly spray cookie sheet with Pam and wipe off  excess lightly with paper towel; any excess of the cookie sheet may burn  while cookies are baking. You need only a very light film of the Pam just  to keep cookies from sticking. Use 1 measuring teaspoonful of dough for  each cookie and place 2" apart on prepared cookie sheet. Bake in preheated  350F oven 6-8 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool on paper towels, removing from  cookie sheets carefully.
