Tapenade Blanche
Lemon juice (fresh is, Cayenne pepper, Pernod or other French, Mayonnaise, Pitted green olives, salt and pepper, Fennel bulb (up to 1), 
(an anitelle syrup, such as Vedrenne, may serve as an non-alcoholic  substitute, in which case you should increase the lemon juice to off set  the sugar in the syrup)    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cut the fennel bulb in half, removing the  short green stalks. (Retain the stalks.) Rub the bulb halves with salad  oil, place in a baking dish, and put in the oven at mid-level. Allow the  bulb to soften (use a cover) for about 40 minutes, longer if necessary.  Meanwhile, finely chop the green stalk and save 1/4 cup. Remove the  softened fennel and let it cool. Then chop the fennel into coarse dice and  place in a food processor with the all purpose blade installed. Add the  pitted olives, cayenne, creme fraiche, mayonnaise and lemon juice. (Dont  forget to save the chopped stalks, and be sure Not to put them into the  processor.) Process the mixture until it produces a smooth spreadable  texture-not like peanut butter, but smooth nonetheless. Add more mayonnaise  and creme fraiche in a 1-to-4 proportion if you need more liquid to make  the mixture more spreadable, but dont let the mixture get too creamy.  Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper. Then add anywhere from 1 to 3  tablespoons of Pernod. The idea is to import a subtle suggestion of anise,  not to produce a licorice-flavored spread. Then add and blend in the  chopped fennel stalks by hand, not with the processor blade in a fresh  bowl. Serve after allowing to chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Add  more salt, if required. Then spread on toasted (optional) rounds of  baguette loaves. Melba toasts are surprisingly good for this. This is a  spread that contrasts nicely with Tapenade Noire.
