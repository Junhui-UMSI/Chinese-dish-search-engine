Brush the cutlets with the melted butter, then sprinkle with salt and  pepper.  Roll the prepared cutlets in the cracker crumbs, then dip them  into the egg, then into the bread crumbs.  Melt the butter in a shallow  pan, then cook the cutlets in the butter, first on one side and then on the  other until golden brown.  Put the cream and milk on them, cover the pan  tightly, and cook in oven 300 about 1 hour. Remove to a hot platter.  Thicken the sauce remaining in the pan with a few bread crumbs and strain.  Serve with the cutlets.    NOTE:  The cutlets should be cut from best quality veal and cut about three  quarters to one inch thick.    This amount will serve four persons, allowing one cutlet to each.    Recipes sent to me from Bill, wight@odc.net
