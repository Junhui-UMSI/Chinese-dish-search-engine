Black pepper, *very hard boiled eggs, Olive oil (Extra Virgin), White cider vinegar (no, Salt, Chives, Crisco cooking oil, Beef baloney (get the 100%, Parsleys, Very large Spanish onion, White pepper, 
*For perfect hard boiled eggs "every" time, place cold water in pan, put in  eggs and have water level "over" the eggs. Set heat level for pan to "high"  and leave at that setting until done. When water reaches FULL BOIL set  timer for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, place pan in sink and run cold  water in pan for 2-3 minutes or until eggs feel cold to the touch. The  shells will come off very easily now!!    Stack baloney and cut in long thin strips about 1/4 inch wide. Cut onion  into long 1/4 inch strips. Cut hard boiled eggs into large cubes with knife  although I push the eggs through our metal french fry holder. Put the  baloney, onion and eggs in a large plastic bowl and mix with large wooden  spoon.    In 4 cup pyrex measuring cup add the oils, and then add in the spices, and  then blend well and pour slowly in the large bowl of baloney,onion and  eggs. *Note-the smell of vinegar "will" fill the kitchen! Let mixture  marinade sitting on kitchen table or counter for 2 hours. (Yes..I know this  sounds strange!) *If it is very hot in the kitchen-then refrigerate for 4  hours. Mix well every 30 minutes. Serve with hot fries!    Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Sep 96    From:    Gregory V Pomykala <pomski@JUNO.COM>    Date:    Wed, 11 Sep 1996 00:39:05 PST
