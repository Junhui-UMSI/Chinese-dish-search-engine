Chicken Fried Steak in Jalapenos
Round steak cut 1/2 inch, Liquid from pickled, Eggs, All-purpose flour, Salt, Black pepper, Vegetable shortening;, 
Cut the steak into four equal portions. Pound the portions, if needed,  until each is about 1/3 to 1/4 inch thick. Arrange the steaks in a shallow  nonreactive dish, and pour 1 cup of the jalapeno liquid over them. Marinate  the steaks in the jalapeno liquid for 2 hours. Most of the liquid will be  absorbed into the steaks. Drain and blot lightly to remove excess moisture  from the surface.    Mix an additional 2 tablespoons jalapeno liquid with the egg in a shallow  dish. Stir together the flour, salt and pepper in another dish. Dredge the  steak in the flour, then dip it in the egg, and back in the flour.    Put enough shortening into a cast iron skillet so that the steaks will be  half-immersed in it during the frying. Warm the fat over medium heat. Add  carefully, turn once, until the meat is fully cooked through and the crumb  coating is brown and crisp, about 8 minutes total. Drain the steaks, and  transfer them to a platter. Keep them warm while you prepare Cream Gravy  from the drippings.    Place the steaks on separate plates, add Pariss Best French Fries and  cover both generously with the gravy. Serve immediately.
