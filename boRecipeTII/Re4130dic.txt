Peppery Coconut Baked Fish with Chutney Sauce
Curry powder, 6 oz fish fillets (red, Mayonnaise, Orange roughy), Butter, Orange juice, Lemon juice, Unsweetened coconut, Chutney (like mango), Lemon juice, Crushed red pepper flakes, Garlic powder, Ginger, Plain bread crumbs, Snapper, bass, turbot, or, FOR SAUCE, Vegetable oil, 
Heat over to 425 degrees and pour oil into 13x9 baking pan (or spray with  Pam); tilt pan to coat evenly. In shallow bowl, mix butter, orange juice,  lemon juice, garlic powder, ginger, red pepper flakes. Salt and pepper if  desired. In shallow bowl, combine coconut and bread crumbs. Dip fish in  butter mixture and coat with bread crumb mixture. Bake at 425 for 5  minutes. Turn fillets over; sprinkle with remaining mixture. Bake an  additional 10-15 minutes or until fish is golden brown and flakes easily.  Mix all sauce ingredients. Serve sauce over fish, garnish with lemon and  parsley.    Variation: 1-1/2 lbs of peeled, deveined, butterflied shrimp can be  substituted. Combine the butter, orange juice, lemon juice, garlic powder,  ginger and pepper flakes in a bowl. Add 1 tsp of coconut extract if you  dont have coconut. Put the butterflied shrimp in the butter mixture and  transfer to plain bread crumbs and toss to coat. Turn shrimp into a "Pam"  sprayed pan, separating the ones that "hunked" together, then into the 425  oven for 5 minutes...flip with a spatula and another 10 minutes in the  oven. If you dont have chutney, add extra lemon juice...it turns out fine.    typed by jessann :)  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #299    Date: Thu, 31 Oct 1996 20:44:51 -0600    From: jessann doe <jessann@texas.net>
