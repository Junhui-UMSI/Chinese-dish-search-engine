Baked Onions
Paprika, Salt, Black Pepper, Butter, Salt, Bread crumbs, crumb topping, Chicken Stock, Yellow onions, Butter, Dried thyme; whole, 
Peel onions but leave them whole. Place the peeled onions in a large pot  and add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil, over, and simmer gently for 30  minutes. Carefully drain the onions, reserving the stock for another use.  Place the onions in a shallow oven proof baking dish so that they fit  comfortably. Combine the melted butter, paprika, black pepper, salt, and  pour the mixture over the onions. Turn the onions so that they all are  coated with the seasoned butter mixture. Bake in a preheated 400 oven for  15 minutes. Mix together the ingredients for the crumb topping and sprinkle  it over the onions and bake for 15 minutes more. busted by sooz  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 179 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Oct 29, 1997
