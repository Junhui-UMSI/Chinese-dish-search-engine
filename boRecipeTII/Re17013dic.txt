Cook the chicken.  Cool and cut into thin strips. Cut onions and carrot  into thin julienned strips.  Mix chicken, onions, carrots and bok choy.  Sprinkle peanuts on top. For the dressing, beat tea into tahini in a small  bowl then mix in all the remaining dressing ingredients. Serve salad with  the dressing on the side. Dressing is very spicy.    ^^^^^^^^^^ This is a wonderful spicy dressing and it is best served on the  side so that diners can adjust the heat level to their own preference.
