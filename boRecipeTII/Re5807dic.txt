Soak beans overnight; drain.  Transfer to a large soup pot and cover the  beans with fresh water.  Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then drain and  rinse them.

Simmer  until beans are tender, about 45 minutes for new beans, longer for older  beans.  Season to taste with salt, then continue cooking until they are  completely soft.    Puree half the beans and cooking liquid at a time in the blender until  smooth.  Return the puree to the pot. Add cream and reheat. Chop toasted  pine nuts finely. Stir in the chopped herbs, reserving some of the chives.  Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with remaining chives and the pine  nuts.    From WWiVNet.  Electronic format by Cathy Harned.
