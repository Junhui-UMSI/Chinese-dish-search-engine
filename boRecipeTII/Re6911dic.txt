Coarser the meat the better. Mix together and cook until thick. Pour into  loaf pans it will set and gel. Can be frozen. Serve by slicing and fry  until crisp. Our family has made this for over 90 years. Normally the hog  head is used except the jowls, they are trimmed off and cured for bacon.  You normally split the head and clean, boil meat until it falls off of the  bones, saving the broth. busted by sooz  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 171 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Oct 27, 1997
