Simmer over low heat for several minutes, stirring constantly. Do not allow  to brown.    Remove from heat, add milks, bay leaf, thyme, white pepper, and vegetable  seasoning. Return to heat, stirring constantly until mixture coats the  spoon. If desired, add wine and simmer 5 minutes more to evaporate alcohol.  [ahem .... this wont really get rid of all the alcohol -mrd]    Remove onion and bay leaf.
