=46rom Lite and Luscious Cuisine of India by Madhu Gadia, M.S., R.D.    Prep: 15 min, Marinate: 4:00, Cook: 45 min.    Remove the skin and all visible fat from the chicken pieces. (I often have  the butcher skin the chicken.) Cut 2-3 slits, 1 inch long and 1/2 inch  deep, in each piece of chicken. Place in a casserole dish and set aside.  Cut onion into 4-5 pieces. In a blender jar put onion, tomato sauce,  yogurt, ginger, garlic cloves, coriander, cayenne pepper, cloves, cumin  seeds, cardamom pods, salt, garam masala and red food coloring. Blend to a  smooth paste. Pour the tandoori paste on the chicken and turn pieces to  thoroughly coat with spices. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap and marinate  in the refrigerator 4-24 hours. Preheat oven to 400F. Remove chicken  pieces from the marinade, saving marinade. Arrange pieces in a broiler pan.  Bake uncovered in the middle of the oven for 30 minutes. Turn pieces over  and brush with remaining marinade. Bake for 10-15 minutes until chicken is  tender. Turn oven to broil. Turn pieces over once again and broil for 5  minutes to get a nice red color. Transfer to a serving platter. Serve with  lemon wedges or squeeze lemon juice over the chicken before eating, if  desired.    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 04, 1998
