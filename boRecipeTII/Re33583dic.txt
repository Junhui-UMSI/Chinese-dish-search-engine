Measure the dough ingredients into the container of the bread machine in  the order given. (Reverse the order in machines which call for adding the  liquids last of all).      Set the machine to the Dough cycle and press Start.      About 1 1/2 hours later, when the dough is ready, coat a work surface  lightly with nonstick cooking spray.      Turn the dough out onto the surface and pat and roll out to about 16 by  20 inches.  Spread with the butter and sprinkle with the cherries, raisins  and nuts.  Mix the sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over.      Roll the dough up to enclose the filling, starting from the 20-inch side.  Seal the roll.      Place on a lightly greased baking pan and pinch the ends together to make  a wreath shape. With a pair of scissors make cuts almost all the way  through the roll from the outside toward the center every 1/2 ~inch. Pull  the cuts outward and lay dough down with a cut side up.      Let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, until puffy. Preheat the  oven to 375 degrees. Bake the tea ring for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.  Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. Frost with a powdered sugar and  milk icing, if desired.  Serve warm. Makes about 8 servings.
