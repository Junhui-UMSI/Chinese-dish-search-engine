There are many New Mexicans who do not feel Christmas is complete without  several bowls of posole complemented with a fiery red sauce. Traditionally  made with ground or cubed pork this version made with chicken makes a  terrific low fat dish for a holiday buffet. Heat the oil in a heavy frying  pan and saute the onion, garlic, cubed chicken and red chile, stirring  occasionally, until the chicken is lightly browned. Add the oregano, cumin  and bay leaves. Pour the wine and water into the pan, cover and cook for 30  minutes. Put the hominy (with the liquid) into a large soup pot. Add the  green chile and the chicken mixture (with the liquid) and cook, over low  heat, for at least one hour, stirring occasionally. Remove the bay leaves  and serve in soup bowls with the Holiday Red Chile Sauce NM.
