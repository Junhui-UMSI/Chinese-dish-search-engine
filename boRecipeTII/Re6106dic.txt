In large bowl combine 2 cups of flour, yeast and salt. In measuring cup mix  water, olive oil and honey. Stir into flour mix forming soft dough. Turn  out onto floured surface and knead with remaining 1/2 c flour until dough  is very elastic- 10 min- dough should be soft so add flour gradually and  only what you need. (The amount will vary depending on the moisture content  in the flour, humidity, etc --just go by the feel of the dough)    Wash, dry and lightly oil the mixing bowl, place dough in bowl, turning to  oil all the sides of the dough. Cover w/ plastic and towel and let rise in  warm place until double 30-45 min.(you can let it rise at room temp for a  longer period - up to 2 hrs - if that is more convenient, if it goes  longer, punch it down and let it rise again,longer rise times make the  dough more flavorfull).    Shape dough, top it as you wish and bake in 400 oven for about 12-15 min. I  personally recommend baking it on a baking stone if you have one.    As for the sauce- I get the Contadina in a squeeze bottle, then spinkle  extra oregano, basil and thyme on top before adding other toppings.    Ive also had success substituting 1/2 cup of flour with white whole wheat  flour- more than that makes the dough really stiff - I also add an extra  tsp of honey when I sub in the wheat flour.
