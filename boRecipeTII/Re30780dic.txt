Source: Adaptation from the Time-Life series _The Good Cook_, vol. "Cakes"    Yield: serves 10-12, one 10" cake    NOTE: Do not use cream of tartar if you are beating the egg whites in a  copper bowl.    Preheat oven to 350:F.    Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder together into a large mixing bowl. Add  the oil, tangerine juice and 1 tsp. of the peel, water, and egg yolks. Beat  the mixture with a wooden spoon until the batter is smooth. Let rest while:    Beat the eggs whites until they are foamy, then add cream of tartar. Beat  until stiff peaks form. Fold the batter into the egg whites (I find this  keeps the cake evenly-textured, rather than the other way around).    Pour into an unbuttered tube pan (I use an angel food cake pan, to insure  it doesnt stick when unmolding) and bake for 50 minutes. Knife test for  doneness.    Take the cake out of the oven and turn the pan upside-down. If your pan  doesnt have prongs that stick up, place tube of the pan onto a bottle. Let  cake cool for one hour. Loosen the cake by running a knife around the  inside edges, turn it out of the pan, then pour glace icing on it. Let  icing harden for approximately an hour-and-a-half before serving.    *Glace Icing: Mix liquid into powdered sugar until somewhat runny. Mixture  should be a little thinner than heavy cream. Mix in tangerine cake and pour  in a steady stream over cake. Be sure to dribble some down the sides.
