Tofu Soup
White pepper, ground, Soy sauce, Celery stalk, Cilantro sprigs, chopped, Garlic, crisp-fried in oil, Firm tofu, Napa cabbage, sliced, Water, Green onions, 
Cut the tofu into cubes & place it in a large pot with water.  Slice  the celery diagonally into pieces about 1/8" thick & 1" long.  Slice  the cabbage into pieces 1/4" wide & 1" long.  Add the vegetables to  the pot. Bring to a gentle boil & cook about 3 minutes: the celery  should be tender-crisp.  Meanwhile, slice the onions diagonally into  pieces about 1/8" thick & set aside.    Add the onions, soy sauce & crisp-fried garlic with its oil, to the  pot. Remove the soup from the heat immediately & pour into a soup  tureen. Garnish with cilantro sprigs & sprinkle the pepper on top.
