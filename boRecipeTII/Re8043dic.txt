Potato and Parmesan Frittata
Eggs, Dried Oregano, olive oil, Parmesan Cheese, Salt, Ground pepper, 
Preheat the broiler. In a large nonstick frying pan with a heatproof  handle, heat the oil over high heat. Add the potatoes and cook, stirring  often, until they are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. In a medium bowl,  beat the eggs, oregano, salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and add  the eggs to the frying pan. Use a rubber spatula to lift up the cooked  edges of the frittata, and tilt the pan to allow the uncooked portion to  flow underneath. Continue cooking in this manner until the edges are firm,  about 4 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese over the top of the frittata. Broil  about 3" from the heat 1 to 2 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm or at  room temperature.    Recipe by: 5 in 10 Appetizer Cookbook    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Meg Antczak <meginny@frontiernet.net> on  Mar 23, 1998
