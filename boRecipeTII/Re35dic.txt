Jim Cohens Sephardic Brisket
Dried pasilla chiles, brisket, Salt, Flour, olive oil, Onions, Fresh ginger, Orange juice, Chicken stock, Cinnamon, Bay leaf, Peppercorns, strong black tea, Dried prunes, Dried apricots, 
These are 5 recipes that I formatted from  http://www.pbs.org/mpt/jewishcooking/. Joan Nathan did a 5 part series on  Jewish Cooking in America. Included with the recipes were actual photos of  the preparation.      Soak the pepper in lukewarm water for 30 minutes. Seed, remove the stems,  and chop into tiny pieces. Season the brisket with the salt and pepper and  dredge with flour. Heat the olive oil in a large heavy roasting pan and  brown the brisket on all sides.   Remove from the pan. Preheat the oven to  400 degrees. In the same pan, over medium heat, saute the onions and ginger  until the onions are transparent. Add the pepper and deglaze with the  orange juice. Reduce for a few minutes. Add the brisket and enough stock or  water to cover. Add the cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and peppercorns. Cook,  uncovered, until the brisket is tender, about 3 hours, turning at 30-minute  intervals. Remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaf. Puree the sauce in a  food processor or blender.   Cool and refrigerate a few hours or overnight.  Remove the congealed fat that floats on the top of the liquid. About 30  minutes before serving bring 4 cups water to a boil. Steep the tea bags in  the water to make a strong tea. Discard the tea bags. Put the prunes and  apricots in the tea to plump for about half an hour. Then drain them.  Reheat with the brisket and the plumped fruit. Serve with saffron rice,  mashed potatoes, or couscous.
