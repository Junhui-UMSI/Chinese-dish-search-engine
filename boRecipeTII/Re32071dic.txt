Barbecued Chicken #4
Whole chicken; cut into, Part lemon juice, Parts butter or margarine, Garlic salt to taste, 
This is our favorite.  You will have to estimate how much you need.  You  probably need about 1 to 2 cups for a good sized chicken.  I get a whole  chicken and cut it into pieces but there is no reason this wouldnt work on  just the chicken breasts.     Use about 2 parts butter or margarine to one part lemon juice.  Melt the  butter and mix with the lemon juice.  Stir in garlic salt to tast.  My  husband says "lots" of garlic salt. If you are opposed to the fat in the  margarine, just use the garlic salt and lemon juice for a tangy, garlicy  grilled chicken.
