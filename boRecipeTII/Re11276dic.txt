Rama Peanut Chicken
Chicken breast, boneless, coconut milk, Red curry paste, Ground roasted peanuts, Fish sauce, Brown sugar, frozen chopped spinach, 
Microwave (or just defrost) the spinach, and drain really well.    Cook the chicken in the coconut mile on med heat about 10 minutes. Since it  is sliced so thinly, the chicken should be cooked. Remove the chicken from  the coconut milk and put aside. In the saved milk, cook the red curry  paste, sugar, fish sauce and peanuts on medium heat, stirring constantly  for 10 minutes.    Add the spinach, and then the chicken.  Stir until warm. Serve    ~-Carolyn
