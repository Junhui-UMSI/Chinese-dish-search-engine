garlic, Fresh habanero peppers, Wine vinegar, Fresh jalapeno peppers, fresh rosemary, Black peppercorns, Fresh serrano peppers, Dried cayenne peppers, 
Roast the dried peppers for 3 minutes in a toaster oven at 250, just til  you can smell it.Reconstitute by submerging in hot water for 20 min, until  soft. Clean and soften peppers and garlic in boiling water for 3 minutes.  Heat vinegar to just below boiling point. Put a sprig of rosemary and the  peppers in a bottle with a wide enough neck (Arizona Tea bottle works  nicely...) for peppers to pass. Fill bottle with vinegar and let sit as  long as you can wait.
