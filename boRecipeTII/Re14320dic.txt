A very tasty cake that can wait in the freezer until right before it  is to be enjoyed. The cake is just as good with coffee as it is as a  dessert.    Chop the almonds and dark chocolate.    Beat the egg whites to a froth. Add the sugar in turns and keep  beating to a froth. Stir down the almonds and chopped chocolate.    Spread the mixture in a greased and with breadcrumbs sprinkled baking  tin with a detachable bottom. Bake in the middle of the oven for  about 25-30 minutes.    Let the cake cool and then detach it. Wash the baking tin and place  the cake back in it up-side-down.    Break the chocolate to the parfait into small pieces and put them in a  bowl. Melt the chocolate in a water-bath.    Beat the egg yolks and sugar really light and spongy. Add the liquid  honey. Whip the cream in another bowl to a froth.    Stir down a few spoonfuls of cream and possibly the coffee liqueur in  the egg mixture. Add the melted chocolate in a fine squirt while  stirring. Stir finaly down the rest of the cream.    Spread the parfait mixture over the cake. Put it in the freezer, at  least for 3 hours.    Cut the white chocolate into small pieces. Bring the cream to a boil  in a small saucepan. Take the saucepan from the heat and put in the  chocolate. Let it melt and stir. Let the garnish cool.    Coil the thick garnish over the cake. Put the cake back into the  freezer and let it stand there for an additional hour at least.    Take the cake out of the freezer about 15 minutes before it is to be  enjoyed. Garnish with sliced cooking chocolate and possibly fresh  berries or fruit.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
