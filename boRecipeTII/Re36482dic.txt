Sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm water and stir to dissolve. combine  the heated beer, sugar, salt and melted butter with the yeast mixture. Add  the eggs, sage, thyme, savory, grated onion and 4 cups of the flour and  beat until the mixture is smooth. Add enough remaining flour until the  mixture becomes difficult to beat. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured  board and begin kneading, adding enough of the remaining flour so that the  dough does not stick to your hands or the board. Continue to knead until  the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a oiled bowl, cover it  with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. About    1 1/2    hours.      When the dough has risen, punch it down and let it rest for 10 - 15  minutes.  Divide the dough in two pieces and shape each one into a round  loaf.  Place each in a loaf pan and let rise until double. Bake the loaves  in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes. Remove the loaves from pans,  and let cool on wire racks.      This bread should be served slightly warm.  You may also freeze the  loaves and reheat as needed.  This dough also makes wonderful dinner rolls  or hamburger buns Makes 2 loaves
