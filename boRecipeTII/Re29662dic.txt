Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Press ground beef into bottom of 8 x 10"  baking dish; season lightly.  Pour soup over ground beef.  Top with  scallions if desired. Place Tater Tots on top of soup. If youre  aesthetically inclined and have a little time,    Cook for 45 minutes or until beef is cooked and Tots are crispy  golden-brown.    For a gourmet touch, sprinkle paprika on the Tots.    Mmmm-mmmm good!    Date: Tue, 25 Jun 1996 20:14:51 0000    From: Allison Greene <argreene@nando.net>    MC-Recipe Digest #129    From the MasterCook recipe list.
