Beef Steak Balsamica
Fillets tenderloin steak, Salt to taste, olive oil, Lemon juice, Oregano leaves, Chianti, Rosemary, Ground pepper, Balsamic vinegar, Butter, 
Trim beef and place in flat container. Mix together the remaing ingredients  to create a marinade, and pour over the meat. Leave at room temperature for  about 1 hour, turning every 15 minutes ( or keep refrigerated overnight).  Preheat the broiler, place the steaks on a broiler pan and broil to the  desired doneness. In the meantime, pour the marinade into a medium-hot  skillet and bring the liquid to a boil. Add the butter and continue to  boil, stirring frequently, until it reduces to a light sauce. Remove the  steaks to a serving platter, and spoon the sauce over and serve.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 01 Sep 96    From:    "Anita M.
