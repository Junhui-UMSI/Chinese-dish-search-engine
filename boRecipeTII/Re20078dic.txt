Vanilla Custard Ice Cream for Donvier Freezer
Salt, Vanilla, egg yolks, Half and half cream, Sugar, milk, Flour, 
Microwave milk in a large Pyrex measure to almost boiling. Mix sugar, flour  and salt together, then whisk into hot milk. MW mixture, whisking every 30  second or so, until it comes to a boil and thickens. Beat egg with whisk in  another bowl, then pour a little of the thickened milk mixture in, beating  constantly. Pour the egg mixture into the larger milk measure, again  whisking until smooth. Cook at high power for a minute or two, until the  mixture boils, watching closely, then whisk again. At this point you can  strain the mixture to make sure no bits of egg have curdled. Chill until  very cold. Add vanilla and half and half cream, stir. Freeze in Donvier ice  cream maker container according to the directions.    The directions for making the custard can be applied to any pudding or pie  filling recipe you have that calls for milk, flour, sugar and eggs. No more  burned milk! No more "stir constantly."
