Ramp Soup
Ramps, Ramps, Stew Meat, Stalks Celery, Potatoes, Salt And Pepper, to taste, Carrots, Butter, 
Boil 1 pound of beef for about 15 minutes in 2 quarts of salted water,  skimming off any scum that may form. Then dice and add 18 to 20 ramps, the  celery stalks, carrots, and the pound of potatoes to the mixture, and  simmer for 2 to 3 hours. Afterwards, fry another 18 to 20 ramps in butter  for about 10 minutes or until thoroughly cooked. To these add one large cup  of soup, salt and pepper to taste, and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Extract  the meat (seerve separately), combine both mixtures, press through a  colander, stir, and reheat.    Ramps can be canned or frozen for winter use.    Biographical Note:    Ramps, related to wild leeks, are perhaps the best known of all edible wild  plants in West Virginia. This herb is found in great abundance in many of  the mountainous counties from April to June, although in some areas it is  rapidly becoming scarce due to commercial collectors. Only time will tell  whether or not this plant follows ginseng into relative oblivion.    Many people are seemingly offended by the rather strong lingering odor  associated with ramp eaters, but a two to three day waiting period is  usually sufficient to re-enter society and the taste more than compensates  for the inconvenience.    Ramps are excellent raw, although they are usually parboiled and seasoned,  or fried in bacon grease.
