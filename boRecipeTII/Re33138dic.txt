There is an article in the LA Times about mustard. Here are 2 of the  recipes. Second one sounds like it would be great with the addition of some  habs! Would it keep longer with additional vinegar?    The Seed of a Bright Idea By JOHN ASH    The most basic of mustards is simply a mixture of mustard powder and water.  This recipe has a little more going for it. Remember that most homemade  mustards tend to be a bit more runny and more pungent than commercially  made, but thats their charm. Also, homemade mustard needs to mature at  least a day, and preferably longer, before being used. When its first  made, the flavor will be almost unpleasant. Coarsely grind yellow and brown  mustard seeds in spice grinder or coffee mill. Mix together with mustard  powder and water. Allow mixture to stand at least 1 hour. Stir in vinegar,  brown sugar and salt. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 day before using.        1    cup.
