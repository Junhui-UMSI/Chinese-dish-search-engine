Asian Millet Salad
Diced, Frozen peas, thawed, Chopped scallion, Soy sauce, Chopped snow peas, 10-oz  package of tofu,, Mirin or dry sherry, 8-oz  can sliced water, Sugar (or other sweetener), Chestnuts, Cooked millet, Garlic, Rice or cider vinegar, 
In a large bowl, combine the millet, tofu, snow peas, peas, water  chestnuts, and scallion.    In a small bowl, stir together the mirin, soy sauce, venegar, garlic, and  sugar.  Pour over the salad and toss to combine.    Although the original recipes didnt say to, I let both of these salads  chill for awhile to let the flavors blend before I served them. I think  that this step is a particularly good idea for the Asian Millet salad, as  it allows the tofu to absorb the flavors of the dressing. If you try these,  I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!    From: "Hayes Theiling Dorton, MPL Corporation" <hayes@mplvax.mpl.com>.  Fatfree Digest [Volume 9 Issue 16] July 7, 1994.
