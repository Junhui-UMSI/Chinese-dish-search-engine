Potato, Cabbage and Cheese Casseroles
Onion, Whipping cream, All purpose flour, Butter, ?, Cheddar Cheese, mozzarella cheese, Garlic, Russet potatoes, 
I found this recipe from Jasper Park Lodge in Alberta, Canada in Bon  Appetit magazine. This is really good and simple to make.    Butter six 11/4 cup custard cups or souffle dishes. Steam potatoes over  simmering water until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Cool potatoes.    Melt 1 tablespoon butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add  onion and garlic and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage and  saute until wilted, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Add potatoes and mix  gently. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    Mix flour and remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small bowl until smooth  paste forms. Heat cream in heavy small saucepan over medium heat. Add flour  mixture to cream. Simmer until mixture is thick, whisking constantly, about  3 minutes. Add to potato mixture and mix gently. Divide potato mixture  among prepared cups. Mix cheddar and mozzarella in small bowl. Sprinkle  over potatoes, dividing equally. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and  refrigerate.)    Preheat oven to 375 F. Bake potatoes until sauce bubbles and cheese melts,  about 20 minutes. Serve hot. Posted to EAT-L Digest 27 Mar 97 by Roger  Young <ryoung@AWOD.COM> on Mar 28, 1997
