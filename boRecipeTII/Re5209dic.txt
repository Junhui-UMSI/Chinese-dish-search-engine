Cut 1 onion in  thin slices and cook it with 50 gr. of butter at low heat, without browning  it, in a heat-resistant casserole. After 5-6 minutes add the saffron and  mix it. Then add the rice, mix again for 2 minutes, add the wine, and pour  the broth over the rice. As soon as it comes to the boil, put the casserole  into the pre-heated oven (180?-200?C) for exactly 15 minutes. The rice will  absorb the broth. Then remove the rice from the oven and add the mushrooms,  mixing them well. A little more butter may also be added at this time. For  a special presentation, the dish may be decorated with small grilled  w?rstels on spits.          5    portions  Posted to recipelu-digest by GramWag <GramWag@aol.com> on Mar 16, 1998
