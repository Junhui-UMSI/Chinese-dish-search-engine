1.  Spray 10-inch glass pie plate with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.  2.  In medium bowl, with electric mixer on high speed, beat egg whites  until stiff but not dry. 3. In another medium bowl, with electric mixer on  medium speed, beat egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored. Using rubber  spatula, gently fold yolks, and remaining ingredients, into egg whites,  until completely blended. Pour into prepared plate; smooth top to  distribute mixture evenly. Microwave on High 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, or until  just set, rotating plate once. (Looking through bottom of plate will help  you see when omelet is set.)
