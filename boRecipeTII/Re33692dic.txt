Date: Fri, 26 Apr 96 10:37:38 PST    From: "Chuck Beekman"  I basically started with Justin Wilsons Sausage Jambalaya recipe and  improvised from there.  Here is the recipe.  I halved the original.    In a 4 or 5 Quart sauce pan, saut onion and celery until onion is almost  clear, add peppers, and garlic and continue cooking a few more minutes  until onion is clear.    Basically just add wine and then everything else and enough water to cover  by about half inch. Stir well cook uncovered on Med/Med high heat until  most of the liquid is absorbed, stir several times. Reduce heat to low/low  and cover tightly and continue cooking for 45 minutes. Dont peak and dont  stir until done.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #306    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
