Stuffing: To prepare stuffing, dice bacon and onion. Cook bacon in a frypan  until partially cooked; add onion and cook for 5 minutes. Drain and chop  mushrooms, add to frypan and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove mixture  from heat, let cool and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add herbs, ground beef,  bread crumbs, eggs, and sour cream. Mix thoroughly. Season with salt and  pepper. Veal: With a sharp knife, cut a pocket in the veal breast or leg.  Fill with stuffing; close opening with toothpicks. (Tie with string if  necessary.) Rub outside with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a Dutch oven.  Place meat in the pan and bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven about 1  1/2 hours. Bast occasionally with beef broth.  When done, place meat on a  preheated platter.  Pour rest of beef broth into the Dutch oven and scrape  brown particles from the bottom. Bring pan drippings to a simmer.  Thoroughly blend cornstarch with sour cream and add to pan drippings while  stirring cook and stir until thick and bubbly. Slice veal breast and serve  sauce separately.
