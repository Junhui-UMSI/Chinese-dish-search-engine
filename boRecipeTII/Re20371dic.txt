Veal Stew with 40 Cloves of Garlic
Carrots, Veal stock, Dry white wine, Vegetable oil, garlic, Bouquet garnish, Salt, dill, Leeks, Boneless veal shoulder;, 
In a heavy casserole (which can go in the oven) brown batches of the veal  in the oil until golden on all sides. As you brown the cubes, remove them  to a platter. When they are all brown, add the leeks and carrots to the  casserole and saute them for about 3 to 4 minutes or until tender. With a  slotted spoon remove the cooked vegetables and discard the fat from the  casserole.    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Return the cooked leeks and carrots to the  bottom of the casserole. Return the browned veal meat and place them over  the vegetables. Add the wine and, over moderate heat, reduce the wine to  almost nothing. Add the stock and bouquet garni and bring the liquid to a  simmer. Add the garlic, salt and pepper. Cover the stew with a piece of  foil with the edges turned upwards to catch the steam which will collect  under the lid. Cover the casserole with a lid (or other piece of foil) and  set in oven. Braise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is fork tender.    Strain the solids from the liquid and keep warm. Remove excess fat and  reduce liquid to 1 1/2 cups. Adjust the seasoning. Serve dusted with fresh  dill. Accompany with rice, plain boiled potatoes or the mashed potatoes and  spinach (see recipe below).
