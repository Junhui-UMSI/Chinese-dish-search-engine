Quick Poppers
Bacon, Fresh jalapenos, Cream cheese, 
Take fresh jalapenos and cut in half (lengthwise). Remove seeds and ribs.  Fill each half with cream cheese, wrap in 1/2 strip of bacon, and toothpick  it so bacon doesnt try to unwrap.  Place in oven at 350 degrees for 30 min  . or more (untill bacon starts to crisp). Enjoy.  Posted to bbq-digest V5 #473 by "Wyndell Ferguson" <CircleF@the-link.net>  on Aug 20, 1997
