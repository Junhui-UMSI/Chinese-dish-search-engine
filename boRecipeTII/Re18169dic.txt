Combine the mint, parsley and butter. Mix  thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover a broiler pan with  aluminum foil. Place the fillets on the pan. Spread half of the herbed  butter equally over the fillets. Turn the fillets over. Spread the  remaining herbed butter equally over the second side of the fillets. Set  aside.  Preheat the broiler. Broil the fillets 2 or 3 minutes on the first  side.  Turn the fillets using a spatula. Broil on the second side until the  fillets begin to flake when tested with a fork (roughly 3 or 4 minutes) -  dont let them overcook. Place the fillets on individual plates. Drizzle  the pan juices over.  Garnish with lemon wedges.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
