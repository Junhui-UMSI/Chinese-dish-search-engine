Warm Garlic Balsamic Dressing
Cloves garlic; cut into 1/4, Inch dice  (8 to 10), Fruity extra-virgin olive, Salt, High-quality commercial balsamic vinegar, Red wine vinegar; (4 to 5), Dark brown sugar, 
In a medium skillet combine garlic, oil and some salt and pepper. Cook  over medium low until garlic is soft and barely blonde. (If it darkens , it  will turn bitter. Throw everything away and start again.) Stand back and  add the vinegars and sugar. Simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Taste by cooling a  sample first (it will be scorching), and seeing if theres soft acidity and  good sweet/tart balance. If too, acid, continue simmering. If acid is  lacking, add a little more vinegar. Remove from heat, cover and hold until  shortly before serving (up to 3 hours). Taste again, adjusting seasonings  if necessary. Heat up and spoon over salad.

Copyright 1992 Lynne Rossetto Kasper.   In the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy this dresses an  antipasto  salad of tart greens, fresh herbs and a pine nuts, all topped  with long  furls of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di  Parma. You could use  it this way, or over steamed little new     potatoes, tossed with arugula,  fresh basil, and red onion. If meat is  desired, add thin slices of rare  roast lamb and youve a wonderful  supper. The dressing is excellent over  sauteed scallops or shrimps.  Or just spoon it over a mixed salad of curly  endive and other  assertive greens like the organic salad mixes so popular  now. It will  overwhelm very delicate ones. Remember if dressing is too  acid,  simply simmer a little longer.
