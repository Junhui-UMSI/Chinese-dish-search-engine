Place in microwave at HIGH until soft when pricked with  fork, 10 to 12 minutes. Turn squash over and rotate after half the cooking  time. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut in half and remove the seeds. Place cut side  up in a square casserole dish. Set aside. Combine cranberry sauce, honey  and allspice in bowl. Microwave at HIGH until hot and bubbly, 3 to 4  minutes, stirring after half the cooking time. Spoon into squash halves.  Microwave at HIGH until heated through, 2 or 3 minutes. Serves 4.
