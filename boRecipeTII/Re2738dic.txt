Peanut Butter Caterpillars
Grape, Banana, Peanut butter, 
Peel and slice a banana. Sprad slices with peanut or sesame butter and  connect the slices. Add a grape up front for the head ("gluing" with more  peanut butter.) If desired, make this a game with the child - what veggie  can we add to make antennas? etc. (maybe a strip of celery.)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/kids.zip
