Was-Nah Corn and Cherry Snack
Seeded Bing cherries; fresh,, Butter, Cornmeal, Brown sugar, 
I think it is important to let our children know that not all Americans  have enjoyed sweet things in the forms that are so common today. This is  such a treat...a treat from the Indian community. It is made with truly  American food products, though we will substitute Bing cherries for the  chokecherries and butter for the buffalo kidney fat. We still have a dish  that is close to a wonderful Indian snack. The toasted cornmeal winds up  tasting something like popcorn.      Place the cornmeal on a cookie sheet and toast it in a 325? oven until it  begins to brown. Careful--this will not take long.      Drain the cherries well and chop coarsely. Mix all ingredients together  well and chill in the refrigerator. To serve, simply dish out by the  tablespoonful. It is eaten like candy.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
