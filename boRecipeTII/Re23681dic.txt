STEP #1 - Heat a non-stick saute pan and lightly brown chicken.  Add 1  tablespoon oil and the onion. Fry over medium heat, stirring occasionally,  for 20 minutes or until onion becomes translucent. Add salt, pepper,  saffron water, and turmeric. Pour in 1 1/2 cups water. Cover and simmer  over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.    STEP #2 - In a non-stick skillet, fry the parsley and mint in 1 tablespoon  oil over medium heat for 10 minutes and add to the chicken.    STEP #3 - Add lime juice and the artichoke hearts to the chicken. Cover and  simmer for 40 to 55 minutes over low heat.    STEP #4 - Check to see if the artichoke hearts are tender. Taste the  khoresh and adjust seasoning. Transfer it to a deep casserole. Cover and  place in a warm oven until ready to serve.    STEP #5 - Serve hot from the same dish with steamed basmati; cook it very  slowly with a very tight fitting lid.  Add salt to water to help rice  withstand a longer cooking time.    Nush-e jan! (Enjoy this food of life.)    VARIATIONS:  For *ab ghureh* substitute 3/4 cup unripe grape juice for the  lime juice. Frozen (2 9-oz pkgs) or bottled artichokes may be substituted.  Drain well. If pre-cooked, adjust cooking time, adding artichoke hearts  when appropriate to step 3. Chicken can be replaced with 1 pound lean stew  meat such as lamb, veal or beef, cut into 1 inch cubes. In step 1, increase  water to 2-1/2 cups;  and simmer for 55 minutes instead of 30 minutes.    Copyright (c) 1994 by Najmieh Khalili Batmanglij.  Persian Cooking for a  Healthy Kitchen.
