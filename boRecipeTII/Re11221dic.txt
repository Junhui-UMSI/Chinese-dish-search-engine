Raisin Scones
Saffron Threads, Buttermilk (180ml), Salt, Zest of one large orange, Ground cumin, Sugar, Raisins (120g), Butter, in pieces (75g), Lemon juice, Baking Powder, Whole wheat flour (260g), 
Cumin and saffron combine here with raisins to make a heavenly  version of this popular breakfast bread.    Steep saffron in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Sift together dry  ingredients.  Cut butter into flour coarsely.  Add raisins and zest,  mix well.  Add saffron to milk, mix well, then add to flour to form  dough.    Before lifting dough from work bowl, flour a surface large enough to  make about a 9-inch circle.  Preheat oven to 450F (232C).  With a  floured knife blade, cut the dough into 8 wedges.  Transfer the dough  onto a greased cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until  browned and cooked through.  Serve warm.
