From: kneadles@esosoft.com (Hugs)    Skin, clean and cut the rabbit[s] into 7 pieces.    Chop the bacon and the garlic very fine. Crumble and add the sage. Season  the rabbit parts with salt and pepper and dredge them lightly in the flour.  Heat the vegetable oil in a large casserole, add the rabbit and cook until  browned, turning it once, about 3 minutes per side. Discard the oil from  the casserole. Add the bacon mixture, and return to the heat, cooking 3  minutes and stirring occasionally. Add the Balsamic vinegar and white wine,  and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of the stock, salt and pepper to taste, and  cover the casserole. Simmer until the rabbit is tender, about one hour,  stirring occasionally and adding the remaining stock gradually to keep the  meat moist. Transfer the rabbit pieces to a large serving dish and pour the  sauce over them. Older animals will require up to two hours of cooking.
