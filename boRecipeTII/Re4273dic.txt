Perogi Dough
Butter, Flour, Egg, Lukewarm water, Salt, 
Mix all ingredients together lightly & knead in bowl. Rest dough for  one-half hour, covered. Knead the dough on a flour coated board &  roll out to one-eighth" thickness. Cut out circles with a cup, glass,  or doughnut cutter (weve found 4.5 to 5" ideal diameter). Fill with  favorite filling pressing edges well together (like turn-overs). Cook  in boiling (gentle boil) water for about ten minutes. Remove using  slotted spoon & rinse lightly with cold water. Serve with melted  butter, salt, pepper.
