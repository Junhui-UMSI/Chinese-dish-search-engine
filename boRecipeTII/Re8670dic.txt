Potted Blue Cheese with Port
Cayenne pepper, Paprika, Worcestershire Sauce, Salt, Blue cheese, Butter or margarine, Port wine, 
Put cheese in bowl and crumble with a fork or pastry blender. Add butter,  salt, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper; blend well. Gradually  beat in Port, then continue beating until mixture is light and creamy. (An  electric mixer is excellent here). Pack into small jars, individual  casseroles, or any small dishes with covers. Cut a piece of waxed paper to  fit and lay it over the top of the cheese, then cover the jar or dish  tightly. Store in the refrigerator. Serve with crisp crackers as an hors  doeuvre, dinner finale, or salad accompaninment. NOTE: If the cheese is to  be stored for any length of time, cove the top with melted paraffin instead  of waxed paper. Jars of this cheese, make excellent gifts.
