Poached Halibut in Saffron Broth
Onion, White wine, Halibut fillets, Fish stock, Garlic, Carrot, Bay leaf, Black Pepper, Saffron, Ground cumin, salt, 
This is a lovely, simple dish. The saffron in the poaching stock turns the  fish a beautiful golden color. Be sure to keep the stock just at a simmer  as you poach the fish, so that it doesnt toughen, but remains succulent.  After such a lowfat main course, indulge in a slice of Chocolate Almond  Cheesecake guilt-free.    In a large saute pan over high heat, bring the white wine, stock, garlic,  onion, carrot, saffron, ground cumin, bay leaf, salt, and pepper to a boil.  Turn the heat down, and when the mixture has reached a simmer, add the  halibut. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes on each side for a fillet 1 inch/2.5 cm  thick. Remove the fish with a slotted spoon.    Serve the halibut with steamed rice and drizzle with some of the poaching  liquid. (The remaining liquid may be strained and frozen for later use.)  Serves four.
