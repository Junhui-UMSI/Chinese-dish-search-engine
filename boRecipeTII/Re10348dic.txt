In a medium nonreactive saucepan, add vinegar, sugar, garlic, salt, mustard  seeds and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Stir in sliced carrots, cover and  return to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until carrots are softened,  but still crisp, 8 - 10 minutes.    Rinse carrots in colander under cold running water; remove bay leaf and  serve.
