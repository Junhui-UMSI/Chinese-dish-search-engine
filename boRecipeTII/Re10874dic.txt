The Whole Foods Bible by Chris Kilham    Wash the quinoa well to remove bitterness. Drain in a fine sieve. Set  aside.    Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid.    Meanwhile, scrub and dice the carrot. Shuck the corn and cut the kernels  off the cob.    When the water has come to a boil, add the salt, quinoa, carrot and corn  kernels and return to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20  minutes, until all the water is absorbed.    Serve hot, garnished with parsley, a dab of unsalted butter if desired and  lots of freshly ground pepper.
