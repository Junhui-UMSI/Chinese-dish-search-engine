Pre-heat oven to 400.    Grind to paste the ginger, garlic, and 4 chillies. Add to yogurt along with  tomatoes, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, turmeric, garam masala, coriander  powder, red chili, coriander leaves, mint and slit chillies. Mix well and  set aside. For best results let this soak for 2-3 hours.    Fry half the sliced onions in 3 tbsp. ghee until translucent. Add the rice,  stir till coated with ghee and fry until a little crisp. Add water, cover  and cook on low, low heat till three-fourths done. Remove from heat.  Removing rice off heat after it is three-quarters done should leave some  fluid content that will get absorbed in the baking process. Baking allows  the flavors to seep in evenly as well as make the rice fluffy.    Heat 4 tbsp. oil plus 1 tbsp. ghee. Add tez patta, fennel, star anise (a  must!). Add remaining sliced onion and fry until clear. Add vegetables,  stir until crisp cooked. Add yogurt mix, salt to taste and cook it down  till thick and spoonable.    Spread some rice in a large aluminum baking pan, then spread on some of the  yogurt mix. Repeat, alternating rice and yogurt mix till everything is used  up. Cover tightly with foil wrap by crimping foil over edges of pan. Bake  for 30 mins.    Serve with a cold raita and a light curry of your choice.
