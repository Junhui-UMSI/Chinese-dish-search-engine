Vegetable Lasagne
Nutritional yeast, Mushrooms, Cauliflower, Tomato sauce, Basil, Canola oil, -to:, Salt, Onions; -OR-, Lasagne noodles, Thyme, Celery stalks, Tomato paste (or sauce), Tofu, Chard (or spinach), 
Mash up the tofu in a bowl and add salt, nutritional yeast, spices, tomato  paste.  Chop the celery, caulflower, and onion finely and saute in oil.  When mostly cooked add the mushrooms, sliced. When the mushrooms are done,  add the vegetables to the tofu and mix well.    Cook the lasagne noodles in water until done.  This can be done beforehand  to save time.  Grease your casserole pan lightly with some oil to help  prevent sticking. Place a layer of noodles down and spoon some tomato sauce  over it.  Put a layer of tofu/veggies down.    Saute the chard (or spinach) in a pan with just a little bit of oil. When  completely cooked down and soft, add half to the lasagne, spreading evenly  over the layer. Add more sauce then noodles, then tofu than another layer  of chard.  Top with more sauce, more noodles and a large amount of sauce  (to prevent any burning or drying out of the noodles when theyre cooked).  Preheat oven to about 350 or 375 and cook roughly 35 minutes, or until  bubbly and hot.  SERVE! I guarantee itll be among the best lasagne youve  ever had....
