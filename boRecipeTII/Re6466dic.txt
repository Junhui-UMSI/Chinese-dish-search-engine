Plums (Pears) Poached in Sauternes and Vanilla (r T)
Lime Rind, Plums, Lowfat Vanilla Yogurt, Fresh lime juice, Sauterne Wine, Honey, Vanilla Beans, 
*NOTE: Original recipe used the plums...I didnt have them so I used fresh  pears and it was great!!    Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into a saucepan, reserving bean for another  use. Add sauterne and stir well. Bring mixture to a boil over med-high  heat. Add plum halves, cut sides up, in a single layer in saucepan; cover,  reduce heat, and simmer 15 min. Remove plums from saucepan with slotted  spoon; set aside and keep warm.    Bring sauternes mixture to a boil over med-high heat; cook 4 min or until  reduced to 1 C. Remove from heat; stir in honey and lime juice.    Place 2 plum halves into each of 4 dessert compotes; top each with about  1/4 C sauternes mixture and 1 T yogurt. Garnish with lime rind, if desired.    Yield: 4 servings    This was really, really good. I used fresh pears and it was excellent.
