Bacon Biscuit Balls
Bisquick, Bacon, Bell peppers -- chopped, Pepper -- black, Cheese -- * see note, Onions -- chopped, milk, Eggs, 
*I would add shredded cheese to the original recipe instead of as an  option. Fry and crumble bacon.  Preheat oven to 450. Mix all ingredients.  Form in small balls on ungreased cookie sheet. Brush with beaten egg or  milk.  Bake for 8-10 minutes or until golden.    Sylvias comments: Im not sure where I got this recipe, but it was easy  and quite good, and I bet just about anything could be substituted for the  bacon/bell pepper/onions. I used oregano and shredded cheddar in one batch,  and dried salad toppings in another, and they all came out fine. I also  dropped tablespoonsful onto a cookie sheet rather than forming them in  small balls and skipped the "brush with beaten egg" part    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
