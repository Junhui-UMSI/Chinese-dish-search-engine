Basic Chinese Sauces
Water, Cornstarch, Sesame oil, Soy sauce, Oyster sauce, Chili paste, 
Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Stir-fry your  meat first and set aside; then stir-fry your vegetables, return meat  to wok or skillet with the sauce mixture. This recipe would be for  using 1 lb of meat, but I like to double this recipe as we like a lot  of sauce.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #225    Date: Mon, 19 Aug 1996 09:54:48 -0400    From: "S.
