Pork and Venison Terrine
Ground cinnamon, Salt, Several sprigs fresh parsley, Heavy cream, Garlic, Several sprigs fresh thyme, Venison; stew meat preferred, Chicken liver; cleaned of, Eggs, Pork shoulder or butt, Brandy, Onion, Black Pepper, Ground mace, Flour, 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.    Pass the pork shoulder and venison through the medium die of a grinder for  a coarse grind. Place the chicken liver in the bowl of a food processor and  pulse to a fine paste.    Combine the liver, pork and venison in a large bowl that has been chilled  in the refrigerator. Chop the onion, garlic, thyme and parsley in the  processor until very fine and add to the meats in the cold bowl. Combine  the salt, pepper, eggs, cream, brandy, flour, cinnamon and mace and add to  the meat mixture. Mix well and chill the entire mixture for 30 minutes.    Line a large loaf tin with plastic wrap, pour the terrine mixture in,  tamping down to insure an even layer. Cook the terrine in a water bath in  the oven by heating some water in a tea kettle, place the prepared terrine  into a roasting pan set in the oven, and pour the hot water into the  roasting pan, being careful not to get any water into the terrine. Bake for  about 90 minutes or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 155  degrees. Remove from the oven and cool.    Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the terrine, poking holes in the plastic  so that hot air can escape. Place 2 to 3 pounds of weight (such as dry  beans still in the bag) on top of the plastic wrap to weigh down and  compress the terrine and refrigerate overnight.    Remove from the oven and cool. Refrigerate overnight and serve cold with  mustard, pickles and a green bean salad.    Yield: 12 to 15 slices    c.
