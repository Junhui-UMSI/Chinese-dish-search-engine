Pork Tenderloin Bundles
Tomatoes; sliced 1/4 inch, Bacon slices (approximately), Sweet onions; sliced 1/4, Pork tenderloin; sliced, Garlic powder, Pepper, 
Slice the pork tenderloin into 1" or thicker pieces, then flatten with the  side of a cleaver or rolling pin to 1/2" thickness.  Cross two slices of  bacon, forming an "X".  Place one of the flatten tenderloin slices on top.  Sprinkle with pepper and garlic powder (no need for salt!), then top with a  slice of onion and a slice of tomato.  Bring up the four ends of the bacon  slices and secure on top with a single wooden toothpick.  This should form  a neat package.     I grill these over medium low heat, but be prepared to dowse the flames --  that bacon drips like crazy!  These are done when the tenderloin loses all  pinkness, about 20-30 minutes.  These also work well in the oven.     These really are GREAT!    NIGAS@MCS.COM (CRAIG HAIRRELL)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
