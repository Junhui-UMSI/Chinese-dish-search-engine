Whole Wheat Soda Bread
Salt, Raw wheat germ, Buttermilk, Egg, Butter, Baking soda, All-purpose flour, Whole wheat flour, 
Heat oven to 450 degrees F.    Whisk together dry ingredients in a large bowl. Using your fingertips, work  the softened butter into the flour mixture. (Rub the flour/butter mixture  between your thump and forefingers.) In a separate small bowl, whisk the  egg and then whisk in the buttermilk. Make a well in the flour, and add  most of the buttermilk mixture (reserve 1/4-cup) and whisk together with  your fingers to form a loose dough. (Stiffen your fingers and rotate your  hand like a beater.) If dough will not come together, add some or all of  the remaining buttermilk mixture in 1 tablespoon increments.    On a well floured work surface, turn out the dough. Sprinkle with flour and  shape into a circle. Knead 3 or 4 times gently then flatten slightly with  the tips of your fingers so that the dough is 7 inches in diameter and  1-1/4 inches high. Cut a cross on the top all the way to the sides,  transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 400  degrees for another 20 minutes. Check bread. When it is done it will sound  hollow when thumped on the bottom, be well browned, and an instant read  thermometer will read about 185 degrees when inserted halfway into the  bottom. Let sit 1/2-hour before slicing.    Yield: 1 loaf    NOTES : Recipe courtesy Christopher Kimball, Cooks Magazine    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9042    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Feb 7, 1998
