Blend together remaining ingredients and  pour over breasts and cheese. Cover and bake 45 minutes in a medium 350  degree oven until chicken is done. To serve, remove chicken, stir residual  sauce in baking dish until smooth, and spoon over breasts. Ideal for  buffets or large groups.  Can substitute low-cholesterol sour cream and  cheese.  If canned chipotle is unavailable, dried chipotle will do.  Altering amount of chipotle will alter spiciness of dish. Can add sauteed  mushrooms before baking.
