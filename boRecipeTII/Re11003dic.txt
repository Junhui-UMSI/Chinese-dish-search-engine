Anywho...it needed a sauce to perk it up....and I saw this  as a means of (finally) getting some heat into, or at least onto, the food  at this establishment that underpays me so well. Still in the experimental  stage and I didnt have anything but japs on hand...but wait until I get my  hands on some habs...hehehe..gonna be a bright lite in the sky down here in  Mississippi.  All comments, favorite sauce recipes of similar type, and  flames graciously accepted...and it was pretty good even if it did have a  tarragon hint (see recipe). Taste as you make it, brave explorers....and my  apologies if my approximations offend...but it works for me.    Raels Approximation of a Remoulade Sauce (which is ambiguous at a minimum)    NOTE:  mayo based; no egg(s); could be made with eggless mayo and other  vegan products, obviously.    Yield: a quart, more or less...    Process in a food processor until quite unrecognizable (-izeable?  I quit):    Obviously, you can change amounts as desired.  Now excuse me as I phone in  a complaint to the radio station playing some idiots remake of "If 6 was  9"...no bass, a drum machine, and the voice is run through a synthesizer or  something...blasphemy, by damn.
