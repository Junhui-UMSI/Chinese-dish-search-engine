Quiche in a Green Chile Shell
Whole Green Chiles; *, Monterey Jack Cheese; **, Eggs; Large, Pepper, milk, Chorizo Sausage; Bulk, 
*     You should use 2 4-oz cans of the green chiles and drain each can **  There should be about 1 cup of the shredded Monterey Jack Cheese.  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------  Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Generously grease a 9-inch pie plate 1  1/4-inches deep.  Cook and stir the sausage in a skillet until done; drain  on paper toweling.  Cut a lengthwise slit in each chile and open them up.  Arrange on the bottom and sides of the pie plate forming a shell. Sprinkle  with the cheese and sausage.  Beat the eggs slightly and then beat in the  milk and pepper.  Pour the mixture into the chile-line pie plate. Bake,  uncovered, until a knife inserted halfway between the center and the edge  comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Let stand for 10 minutes before  cutting.    Miscellaneous recipes from the collection of Mike Orchekowski.  File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mo-misc.zip
