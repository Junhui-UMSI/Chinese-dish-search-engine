PREPARE MARINADE:  Mix flour, salt, cornstarch, 1 t sherry, beaten egg, 1 t  soy sauce and baking soda; stir in shrimp and refrigerate at least one  hour.    COMBINE SEASONINGS:  minced ginger root, garlic, green onions and chili  peppers; reserve.    COMBINE SAUCE INGREDIENTS:  sugar, 2 t sherry, 2 T soy sauce, vinegar,  ketchup and water; reserve.    Heat peanut oil until a chopstick bubbles in it.  Add half of the shrimp  mixture and stir briskly about 10 seconds to lightly cook. Remove with a  strainer to a bowl. Repeat with other half of shrimp mixture.    Remove all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the wok. Heat the oil, add the  seasonings and brown lightly. Add the sauce mixture to the seasonings in  the wok and stir until the mixture starts to bubble.    Add shrimp back to wok and stir fry for several seconds, until shrimp are  well-mixed.  (Remember that shrimp cook very quickly.) Stir the sesame oil  into the shrimp mixture and serve hot, with rice on the side.
