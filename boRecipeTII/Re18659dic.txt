Stir in remaining warm water, flour and sugar.  Beat until  smooth.  Cover with loose fitting cover. DO NOT REFRIGERATE!

The batter is ready to use.  This makes 3 cups batter to use in the  recipes. If you want to you may put 1 cup batter each into 3 containers and  give 1 or 2 away. Save 1 cup to begin process all over again OR you can use  all 3 cups batter for the recipes at 1 time and when you want to bake these  again just start the starter again.
