* (more or less depending upon strength) ** (do not use shallots that are  withered or sprouting)    From Catherine Brandel. These shallots turn a pretty rosy pink from the red  wine vinegar. Theyre crunchy because they are not allowed to cook, simply  to soak up the sweet-sour solution. The solution should not be pickley.  Taste it, the amount of water and sugar depends on strength of your  vinegar.    Combine all ingredients except the shallots and bring to a boil.    Put the shallots in a clean, dry jar and cover with the sweet-sour  solution. Let cool cover, and store in the refrigerator. These will keep 2  weeks or more.    Uses: Add to salads, or meat dishes, or simply nibble them whenever you  feel like it.    Makes about 1 pint.
