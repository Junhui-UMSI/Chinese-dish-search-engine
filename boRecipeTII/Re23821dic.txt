Sichuan Peppercorns, Chinese sesame oil, Finely chopped Ginger, Coarse. chopped dried chiles, Ground Lamb, Fresh Asian or reg. Basil, Light soy sauce, Dark soy sauce, Caul fat or crepinette, Minced Fresh Coriander, Finely chopped Garlic, Salt, Rice wine or dry sherry, 
This is an Asian twist on a French appetizer. Caul fat can be ordered from  your local butcher.    SOAK THE CAUL FAT in a bowl of cold water; this will allow the caul fat to  unravel easily. In a medium-sized bowl, mix the ground lamb with all the  ingredients except the caul fat. Cut the caul fat into 20 (5-inch) squares.  Lay out a square of caul fat and place several tablespoons of lamb mixture  onto one end. Fold the sides in to form a package. Repeat until you have  used up all the lamb. Recipe can be done ahead to this point and  refrigerated. Wrap the crepinettes well in plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Approximately 40 minutes before you are ready to cook, make a charcoal fire  and, when the coals are ash white, grill the crepinettes for about 8  minutes on each side, or until they are done (firm to the touch).
