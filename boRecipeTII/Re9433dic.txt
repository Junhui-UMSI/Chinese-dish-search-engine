Pumpkin and Sage Risotto with Pine Nut Sauce
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Onion, Garlic, Fresh sage, Arborio rice, Pumpkin flesh, Vegetable stock, Pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, milk, Nutmeg, ground, Salt, Black pepper, 
Heat the oil in a large pan and saute the onion, garlic and sage for about  5 minutes, until golden. Add the rice and pumpkin and stir-fry for 1 minute  until all the rice grains are well coated in oil.    Add 1/4 pint of stock and simmer, stirring until absorbed. Continue to add  the stock a little at a time, stirring frequently, for about 25 minutes,  until the rice is creamy and all the liquid is absorbed.    Meanwhile, process the pine nuts, cheese, milk and nutmeg in a blender  until smooth. Stir into the risotto, with the final addition of stock, and  simmer for a further 5 minutes. Season to taste and serve at once.    [Formatted to MasterCook by Terri Law on 11/30/96, MC-Recipe on 12/1/96]    >From :__The Pumpkin Cookbook__, Nicola Hill Ed., Hamlyn, c. 1996, London.  NOTES : This is a rich and creamy risotto, with the slightly unusual  inclusion of a pine nut sauce.  When pumpkin is not available, use 2 cups  winter squash and substitute rosemary for the sage.
