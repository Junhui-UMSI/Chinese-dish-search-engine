Cut meat away from rabbit or chicken bones and chop into 1/4-inch pieces;  use scraps, bones, and giblets (excluding the liver) to make the stock.  Refrigerate meat until ready to use. Combine the seasoning mix ingredients  in a small bowl and set aside. Melt the margarine in a 4-quart saucepan.  Add 3/4 cup each of the onions, celery, and bell peppers, then stir in the  seasoning mix, Tabasco, and tasso. Cook over high heat until onions are  dark brown, about 20 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the remaining 3/4  cup each of onions, celery, and bell peppers. Cook about 5 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Add the tomato sauce and simmer about 5 minutes,  stirring constantly. Add the rabbit and cook over high heat for 15 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Stir in the rice, mixing well. Reduce heat and  simmer for about 12 minutes. Add the stock. Bring the mixture to a boil;  reduce heat and simmer covered over very low heat until rice is tender but  still firm, about 15 minutes. To serve, mold rice in an 8-ounce cup. Place  2 cups on each serving plate for a main course or 1 cup for an appetizer.  Makes 4 main-dish or 8 appetizer servings.
