AvRutick    To prepare filling, combine the ground veal with the sauteed mushrooms. Add  the beaten eggs and season with the onion powder.  Stir in the bread  crumbs. Mix well.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Lightly grease a 10 x 15 x 1 inch  baking pan; set aside. Pound each chicken cutlet to flatten slightly. Spoon  an eighth of the filing across the center of each cutlet. Roll up. Roll out  each puff pastry square to accommodate the chicken roll.  Place the chicken  roll seam side down on the pastry.  Roll the pastry around the chicken.    Fold up the pastry edges and seal.  Arrange the rolls seam side down on the  prepared baking pan.  Place in the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes.  Lower the heat to 325 degrees F. and continue baking for an additional 45  to 50 minutes, until golden brown. Serve with Cherry Jubilee Sauce.    Cherry Jubilee Sauce: (makes about 2 cups) Into a 1 cup measure, drain the  syrup from the cherries.  Add water, if necessary to make one cup of  liquid.    In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch in the tablespoon of water.  Add the sugar and blend in the syrup.  Stir until smooth.  Cook over low  heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and bubbles, about 1  minute. Stir in the cherries and optional liquor.
