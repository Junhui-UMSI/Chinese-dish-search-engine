Pickled Jalapenos #3
carrot, salt, garlic, Water, Jalapeno peppers, fresh, 
Pack jalapenos, mingled with carrot, onion, and garlic slices, into canning  jars.  (Pint jars are most convenient.)  Pour vinegar/water/salt mixture to  fill near top of jar.  Pour about 1/8 inch of oil (Wesson or whatever) on  top. Dont fill jar all the way to top (leave 1/4 inch of air). Screw lid  on, not extremely tight, and process in boiling water for 15 minutes. (Some  air will be forced from jar, so "leaking" bubbles from the jar are natural.  Remove from hot water and keep for several weeks or months before eating.  Once opened, they are kept in the refrigerator. In fact if you have room  for them, keep the jars in the refrigerator for the whole curing period.
