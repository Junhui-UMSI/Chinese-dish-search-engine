Add walnuts and toast gently,  watching closely to prevent burning.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain  on paper towels. Cool to room temperature. In small bowl combine vinegar,  honey, and mustard.  Whisk to blend and set aside.  In large bowl combine  lettuce, bell pepper, jicama, and figs.  Add dressing, toss to coat, and  sprinkle with reserved walnuts.  Serves 6.    SOURCE:  Colorado  Collage Cookbook    EAT-L Digest  6 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
