Tinga is wonderful as a warming stew or a filling for burritos, empanadas  or tortas (Mexican sandwiches). The flavors improve and intensify with  time, making this the perfect make-ahead dish.    INSTRUCTIONS: Blend together lime juice, olive oil and garlic salt. Rub on  chicken pieces. Grill over medium-hot coals or under a medium broiler. Cook  breasts for about 10 minutes per side; thighs for about 15 minutes per  side.    Tip: If you are in a hurry, you can cheat by buying a grilled chicken --  preferably from a Mexican deli. The chicken will finish cooking in the  sauce where it will absorb all the delicious flavors. Heat oil in a large  skillet. Add onions; saute until softened. Add garlic; saute for a minute  or two longer. Remove onions from pan and reserve. Add chorizo to pan;  saute until browned. Using paper towels, blot as much fat as possible from  pan. Return onions to pan. Add tomatoes, then stir in tomato puree,  chipotle, bay leaf, oregano, brown sugar and salt. Simmer for 20 to 30  minutes. Cut grilled chicken meat off bones; add to simmering sauce along  with diced potatoes. Simmer for 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender and  flavors come together. Serve garnished with avocado slices and lots of warm  corn tortillas. Note: To make chipotle puree from the softer, freshly  smoked chipotles, cut chiles open and scrape out seeds. Place 6 chipotles  in a blender with about 1/4 cup water, or just enough to facilitate  blending; process until smooth. Serves 4.
