Vegetable Cream Cheese
1-2 inch piece of celery, Finely chopped carrot, Salt, Radish, finely chopped, White pepper (optional), Cream cheese, Finely chopped scallion,, 
General instructions for all: Take cheese out of the refrigerator at least  1 hour before making mixtures. It is easier to work with the softer cheese.  I usually mix 2 8oz. bricks of cheese at a time and store in plastic  containers. If kept in the refrigerator, most will last up to two weeks.  Unfortunately, mine never last that long because they are fully consumed by  my wife and I much before that elapsed time!!!!    The recipies are for 1 8oz. block; just double for each block used in the  recipe. Place the cheese in the mixer, apply medium power (3 on  KitchenAide) and blend cheese to a creamy stage. Add additional ingredients  and blend on low (2 on KitchenAide) till fully mixed into cheese. Scrape  out of mixer bowl with a spatula and store in covered plastic bowls in  refrigerator for 24 hours for the flavors to mingle. Serve on toasted  bagels, as an omlett filling, with crudites or crackers, etc.  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v001.n002    From: Arnold Bochner <Arnold.Bochner@faa.dot.gov>    Date: 02 Jan 1997 15:06:40 -0500
