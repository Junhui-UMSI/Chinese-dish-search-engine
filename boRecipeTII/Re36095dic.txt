Spread each with mustard; sprinkle with salt  and pepper. Divide pickles, salt pork (or bacon), and onion among the  steaks equally.  Roll up steaks jelly-roll fashion; secure with beef roll  clamps, toothpicks, or thread. Heat oil in a heavy saucepan, add the steak  roll, and brown well on all sides, about 15 minutes. Pour in hot beef  broth, peppercorns, and bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 20  minutes. Remove beef rolls, discard clamps, and arrange on a preheated  platter.  Blend cornstarch with a small amount of cold water, stir into  gravy and bring to a boil. Boil until gravy is thick and bubbly. Correct  seasonings and serve separately.
