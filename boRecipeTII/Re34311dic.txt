Bbq Spareribs
Cloves of garlic, Onion BBQ SAUCE; (Heinz), Pork or beef ribs; (up to 9), Worchestershire sauce, White wine, Maple syrup, Soya sauce, Chilli sauce; (Heinz), Strong mustard, SAUCE, Vegetable oil, Tobasco, 
Boil ribs, simmer these for 45 min. Let cool. SAUCE: Mean will mix  together.    When the meat is cooked, put in a big dish, (I use two, If you have no  covers, cover with plastic wrap) Add the sauce and mix well to cover every  piece of rib. Cover. Let marinate 8 to 24 hours. (I know its long but...)  They can be cooked on the BBQ. but Im sure also in the oven. BBQ cooking  time is 25-30 min.    I dont know where you are in Canada, but Im in Quebec and (not to get any  jealous reactions) but our BBQ is closed in, there is a window I can open,  we BBQ all year round.
