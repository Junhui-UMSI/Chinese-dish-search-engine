Combine the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a double boiler. Beat at  medium speed with an electric mixer until thick and lemon-colored.  Place over boiling water, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook 10  minutes, stirring constantly. The mixture should be thick. Remove  from the heat and beat in the mascarpone until smooth. Cool slightly.    Beat the whipping cream until soft peaks form; fold into the cheese  mixture.    Combine the boiling water, coffee granules and liquor. Brush on the  cut side of the ladyfingers. Line the bottom and sides of a 3-quart  bowl with the ladyfingers, cut side in. Spoon in half of the filling  and sprinkle with half of the grated chocolate. Top with the  remaining ladyfingers, broken up, and then the filling. Sprinkle with  the remaining grated chocolate and the cocoa. Cover the bowl and  refrigerate. The tiramisu can be made up to 24 hours in advance.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
