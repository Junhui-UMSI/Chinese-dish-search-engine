Beer Sourdough Bread
LOTS of fresh rosemary--at, Yeast, Gluten, Warm water, White flour, Olive oil; optional, Tablespoons, Salt, Beer; flat, Sourdough starter, Sugar, 
Make dough in machine.  Rise outside the machine in a warm place (see ?How  to Make a Proofing Box).  Bake at 375 for about 35 minutes. I brush the top  of the crust with water to make the crust brown nicely.    >From: benford@cts.com (Susan Benford)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe  NOTES : I found and modified a good recipe for sourdough bread.  **  The       key for me is to use the machine to make the dough, and to rise       and bake the stuff OUTSIDE of the machine, which I call the       Invention Exchange with a nod to Mystery Science Theater 3000.       Its a proofing box fashioned from a sytrofoam cooler.[Susan]
