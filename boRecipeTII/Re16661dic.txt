For the torte: Whisk together the egg yolks and the sugar in a large bowl  until blended. Stir in the pecans and the lemon rind. In a separate bowl  beat the egg whites and the lemon juice until the whites are stiff, but not  until dry peaks form. Stir one fourth of the whites into the yolk mixture.  Gently fold in the remaining whites until blended. Scrape into a greased 9  inch springform pan that has been dusted with matzah meal. Bake in a  preheated 325 degree oven for 1 hour or until firm to the touch in the  center. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. The cake may sink in  the center. For the glaze: Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. Combine the egg  yolk, lemon juice, sugar; and butter or margarine in a small saucepan.  Bring to simmering over medium heat, whisking constantly. Remove from the  heat. Stir in the lemon rind. Poke holes in the top of the cake with long  skewers so that the glaze can soak in. With the cake still in the  springform pan, spoon the glaze over. Let the cake stand a few minutes  until the glaze seeps into the cake. Then remove the cake from the pan by  running a thin knife around the rim to release the cake. Garnish with lemon  rind, if you wish.
