Chinese-Style Vegetables
Chicken Stock, Snow Peas, Garlic, Fresh Ginger Root, Bok Choy, Soy Sauce, Canola oil, Cauliflower Florets, Broccoli Florets, Carrots, 
1. In wok or large non-stick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add  cauliflower, broccoli and carrots; stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add chicken  stock; cover and steam for 2 minutes.    2. Add snow peas; stir-fry for 1 minute. Add garlic, ginger root, and  cabbage; stir-fry for 1 minute. Stir in soy sauce or substitute. Makes 6  servings    NOTES : Any seasonal vegetables can be added to this colourful stir-fry.  Examples are celery, onion, sweet peppers, mushrooms, green peas, beans,  tomatoes, asparagus or Brussels sprouts. Green or red cabbage can be used  instead of the Bok Choy ("Chinese Cabbage") or Napa cabbage (crinkly leafed  lettuce). [In my experience, however, red cabbage may turn the entire  mixture purple.]    Recipe by: Anne Lindsay, The Lighthearted Cookbook, p. 120    Posted to EAT-LF Digest by "Ellen Pickett" <ellen@qnetix.ca> on Oct 2,  1998,
