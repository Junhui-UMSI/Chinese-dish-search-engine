Bone duck breasts and trim off excess fat. Cut each breast in half and  place in a shallow dish. Combine ingredients for marinade and coat breasts  thoroughly. Allow to marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.    In a small bowl, combine all ingredients for vinaigrette at least 2 hours  before serving, to allow the flavors to develop.    To assemble the salad, preheat broiler or prepare a fire in a charcoal  grill. Artfully arrange baby greens on individual serving plates. Wipe  excess marinade off duck breasts and grill or broil until medium rare,  about 2 1/2 minutes per side. Do not overcook. Quickly slice breast on the  bias and arrange on plates with greens. Drizzle vinaigrette over greens.  Garnish with flower petals if available and serve immediately.
