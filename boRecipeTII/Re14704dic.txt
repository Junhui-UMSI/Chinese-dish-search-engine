Date: Sat, 20 Apr 96 08:43:56 PDT    From: eboyd@shentel.net    Dice and saute first 5 ingredients. Add meat and brown. Add everything  else, including 1/2 can beer. (Drink the remainder, according to Annie).  Add water JUST TO COVER TOP. Cook about 3 hours on low heat. Stir often.  Remove bay leaves. Couple of notes: Better the 2nd day, if you can wait  that long. Also, those I substitute pure New Mexico ground red chili.  Whatever you use make sure its pure chili powder, no additional seasonings  added.
