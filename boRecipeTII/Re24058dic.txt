Tourta Athineiki (Orange-Walnut Cake)
Salt, Granulated sugar, Walnuts; coarsely chopped, Baking Powder, Eggs, Orange,(juice & grated rind), Butter; sweet, All-purpose flour, 
Cream the butter until light and fluffy, then gradually add the sugar.  Continuing to beat, add the eggs one at a time, beating well, on medium  speed, after each addition. Gradually add the orange juice and rind.  Meanwhile, sift the flour with the baking powder and salt and gradually add  to the batter.  Add the walnuts last, blend another minute on medium high  speed, and pour into a greased and lightly floured 8-inch tube pan. Bake in  a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 to 30 minutes until the color is a light  chestnut and the cake springs back to the touch. (Watch carefully because  this cake bakes quickly.) Turn onto a wire rack, round side up. Dust with  confectioners sugar and cool thoroughly before slicing.    From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles. Avenel Books, New  York.
