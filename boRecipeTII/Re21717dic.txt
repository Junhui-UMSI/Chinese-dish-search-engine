Apple Turnovers
Granny smith apples; cored,, Lemon juice, Butter, Nutmeg, Vanilla extract, Cinnamon, Sugar, White bread; crusts removed, 
In a saucepan, combine the apples, lemon juice, sugar, vanilla extract,  cinnamon and nutmeg. Cook until softened and let cool. Lightly roll out a  piece of white bread and place some filling in    the center of the bread. Fold one corner over diagonally, forming a  turnover. Pinch the edges closed. The turnovers can be frozen at this  point. If baking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Brush the top of the  turnover lightly with the melted butter and place on a cookie sheet. Bake  for 10 minutes or until golden.    Yield: 8 turnovers    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8962    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #801 by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Sep 24, 1997
