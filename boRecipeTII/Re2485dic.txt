Rub the chicken with the oil. Season with salt and pepper. In a hot stock  pot, sear the chicken on all sides. Put chicken aside.    Wipe the stock pot with paper towels, removing chicken fat and leaving only  a coating of oil. Saute onions, garlic and ginger. Caramelize well (about 5  to 7 minutes), then add the curry powder. Mix quickly for up to 2 minutes  making sure not to burn the curry powder. Add the chicken stock, banana,  bay leaves and stir well. Add the chicken pieces to the pan; bring to a  boil; cover and simmer slowly for 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth or water as  needed. Add the yams and cook an additional 20 minutes or until yams are  tender. Serve with rice, dabs of plain yogurt, and a green vegetable.

REVIEW: You might expect the banana to be more noticeable but it blended  with the sauce. Very good with jasmine rice, steamed broccoli and yogurt.  Some would want more curry powder. Boneless skinless chicken thighs would  make for a more graceful meal.
