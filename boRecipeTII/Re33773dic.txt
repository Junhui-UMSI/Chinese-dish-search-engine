1. Slice ocean perch fillets into pieces about 2x1". Dredge in corn starch  and allow to dry slightly on wax paper. Make a batter of about 1/2 cup  flour, 1 egg, 1/2 cup water, and salt    2. In a separate small pot, dissolve 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup cider  vinegar over medium heat. Stir up corn starch in 1/2 cup water, add to pot.  Stir thoroughly. Add pineapple, carrot, sweet pickles, and tomato. Cook 3-5  minutes until sauce is clear and not cloudy. Reserve.    3. Pour oil halfway up wok. Turn heat on highest point. When you think oil  is hot enough for deep frying, take a piece of bread crust and place in oil  to see if it is ready. If the bread crust is not browned readily, then oil  is not ready. If the bread crust is medium brown, then oil is ready. If the  bread crust is a dark brown, then turn oil off and allow it to cool at  least 5 minutes before using. Be sure and retest oil before deep frying  anything in it. When the oil is ready, place 8-10 pieces of fish in batter.  Take a pair of chopsticks or fork and carefully lift pieces of fish from  batter into oil. At first the fish will sink to bottom of oil. They will  rise. When the fish is risen, deep fry about 4 minutes, 2 minutes on each  side. Remove fish to paper toweling to drain excess oil, then arrange fish  on serving platter. repeat procedure until all fish is deep fried. Pour  sweet and sour sauce over fish.    NOTE: Shrimp or chicken are good substituted for the fish in this recipe.
