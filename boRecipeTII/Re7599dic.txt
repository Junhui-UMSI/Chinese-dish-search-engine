1. Have the butcher cut the spareribs into strips 1 1/2" wide and you cut  the bones apart and trim off the fat.    2. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil, and parboil the meat for 3 minutes;  drain well.    3. Wash black beans thoroughly two times; drain, and then crush beans with  the handle of your cleaver or chop very fine with a sharp knife.    4. Heat wok, add oil, garlic and spareribs.  Stir-fry for 5 minutes.    5. Add black bean mixture and all remaining ingredients except the  cornstarch and 4 tablespoons cold water. Bring to a fast boil and then turn  to medium heat, cover, and cook for 40 minutes.    6. Make a thickening with cornstarch and 4 tablespoons cold water and add  to the sparerib mixture.  Bring to a boil again, and serve.    NOTE: Pork spareribs with black bean sauce will still taste delicious the  second or third day.  Reheat for 7 minutes before serving. Serve over rice  as a plate dinner, accompanied by a condiment prepared with Chinese Hot  Mustard.  Hot mustard requires 2 tsp. dry mustard to 2 t. cold water.
