I think my family originally got this from Margaret Rudkins  cookbook.    Beat eggwhites until very foamy, add half the sugar and beat until stiff  but not dry. Cream butter and remaining sugar, beat in egg yolks, and stir  in flour. Fold in eggwhites and pour into buttered and floured pan. Bake at  350F until toothpick comes out clean.  Makes one large tube pan, 2 loaves,  or numerous cupcakes.    Good with fruit or chocolate, but dont try to frost, somehow the flavor  clashes with the standard frostings.
