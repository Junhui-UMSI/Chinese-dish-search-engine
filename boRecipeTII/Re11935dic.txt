Rebekahs Potato Bread
Margerine, Buttermilk; (I use lemon, Dry yeast, Dry potato flakes, Water; (I usually have to, Bread flour, Dry milk, Sugar, Turmeric, 
1. Place all ingredients except yeast into the bread basket.    2. Place yeast in yeast dispenser.    3. Set bread machine for regular bake, sandwich mode. This will take 4  hours.    Note: The turmeric gives the bread the lovely, delicate yellow color. Ive  made this on the dough setting and used the dough for pan rolls, hamburger  buns, hot dog buns. Start with the 1 cup of water, and if its dry at the  first kneading, add two tablespoons water or milk.    This is my standard bread recipe. We much prefer this one to basic white  for sandwiches, rolls, etc.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H. Frye" <shfrye@PEN.K12.VA.US> on Mar  30, 1998
