Date:    Mon, 24 Jun 1996 11:00:50 -0400    From:    Mary H Mizwa <Mzmiz@AOL.COM>  This is a recipe from my mother, Rhae House, that produces wonderful  biscuits.    Sift all dry ingredients into bowl, work in shortening.  Add buttermilk,  then yeast.  Knead gently on floured board, roll and pinch off small ball  or cut. Melt margarine or butter in biscuit pan. Turn biscuits in butter,  when placed in pan. Bake biscuits at once at 350 degrees until brown, or  store in refrigerator and cook as needed.    This makes a big batch, and stays good in refrigerator up to a week.    EAT-L DIGEST 23 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
