White Onion Soup
Cloves, Chicken broth, Cream, or 1 to 3 Tbsps., Ground mace or ground nutmeg, Butter or margarine, Onions, thinly sliced, Bay leaf, (heaped) flour, salt and pepper, milk, 
Heat the butter, then add the onions and cloves. Let onions soften, but not  change color. Sprinkle on flour. Mix well and cook stirring constantly for  1 minute, then add mace or nutmeg, bay leaf and broth. Stir all the time  until mixture boils and you can see that it is smooth. Simmer until onions  are well-cooked, then gradually add the milk. Stir continuously and, when  it boils, remove the cloves and bay leaf and season with salt & pepper to  taste. Serve soup with a garnish of cream or grated cheese.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 06 Feb 97 by "Joanne L. Schweikj"  <SCHWEIKJ@FREDONIA.EDU> on Feb 7, 1997.
