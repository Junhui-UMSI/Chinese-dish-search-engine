Sweet Potatoes and Corn
Corn kernels; fresh or, Butter & olive oil for, Sweet potatoes, 
Try this one on your own. You do not need a recipe for this  early-American dish. Simply precook the potatoes a bit, then cool and peel  them. Slice and pan-fry with a bit of olive oil and butter, along with some  corn kernels. Frozen corn isnt bad with this dish. Keep the frying pan  covered as you cook and add some salt and pepper. Very basic but very good.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
