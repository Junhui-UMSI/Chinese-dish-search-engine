Apple Mash
Apple, cooking, Sugar, Butter, Potatoes, 
Peel potatoes.  Cook in salted, boiling water. Meanwhile peel, core, and  slice apples.  Place in a pot with a tablespoon of water, and the sugar.  Cook until soft. When the potatoes are cooked, drain and mash thoroughly.  Beat in the apples and butter.  This mash goes partic- ularly well with  bacon, or fried herring.                                       -- per Diane Duane                                        Fidonet COOKING echo
