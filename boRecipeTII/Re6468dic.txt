ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2308    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. For the cookies: In an electric mixer,  with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar together. Add the  vanilla, cinnamon, and lemon zest. With the mixer on medium, add the flour,  about 1/4 cup at a time. Stop the mixer once or twice to scrap down the  sides of the bowl. Beat until the dough is smooth and forms a ball around  the paddle. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Roll one tablespoon  of the dough into a ball and place onto the cookie sheet 1-inch apart.  Using your fingers, press down onto the balls to flatten it. Bake for 20  minutes or until slightly golden around the edges. Drizzle cooled cookies  with the melted chocolate. For the plums: In a saute pan, heat melt the  butter. Stir in the sugar to dissolve. Add the plums, lemon juice, and  zest. Saute the plums until they are completely coated with the sugar,  about 2-3 minutes. Flame the Madeira. Reduce to 1-2 minutes over high heat.  Remove from heat. Place the ice cream in an over-sized bowl. Pour the plums  over the ice cream. Position the cookies so they are coming out from the  ice cream. Garnish with fresh mint and powdered sugar.
