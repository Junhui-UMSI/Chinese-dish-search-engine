Wash birds well and season inside cavities  generously with salt, pepper and Louisiana Gold Pepper Sauce. Stuff each  cavity with onion, celery and garlic. Place birds, breast side up, in a  roasting pan and continue to season. In a mixing bowl combine syrup, orange  juice, margarine or butter, thyme and sage. Brush birds lightly with glaze  and sprinkle with paprika to ensure even browning. Surround the birds with  remaining vegetable seasonings and orange sections. Cover tightly and roast  for forty-five minutes. Uncover and allow birds to brown evenly. Continue  to glaze with syrup mixture during the browning process. Once cooked remove  birds and deglaze baking pan with white wine. Add chicken stock and reduce  over medium high heat for a wonderful sauce accompaniment.
