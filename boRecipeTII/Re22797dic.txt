Butter a small souffle dish (6 1/2 " diameter, 2 1/2" deep), dust with  sugar, and spread 1/4 cup apricot mixture on bottom.  Add about a third of  the egg whites to the remaining apricot mixture; gently fold together.  Repeat, carefully folding in remaining egg whites in two batches.  Do not  overmix.

Dust generously with confectioners sugar and arrange sliced apricots on  top.  Serve immediately.
