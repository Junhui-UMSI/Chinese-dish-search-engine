Microwave on medium (50%) 2 to 3 1/2  minutes or until mixture can be stirred smooth and is glossy, stirring  twice. Stir in pistachio nuts.    Spread chocolate mixture evenly into prepared pan. Drop cream cheese  mixture, by spoonfuls, over chocolate; swirl lightly over chocolate. Let  stand until firm or place in refrigerator. Cut into 25 even squares by  making 4 lengthwise and 4 crosswise cuts equidistant from each other, then  cut each square diagonally in half. Store in airtight container with waxed  paper between layers. Keeps best if refrigerated. Makes 50.    From: Steve Herrick Source: [1,001 HOME IDEAS, FEBRUARY 1990]
