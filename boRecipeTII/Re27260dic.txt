Arrange the ladyfingers on a plate and lightly soak them with the cooled  espresso.  Put half of the soaked ladyfingers in one layer in a rectangular  serving dish. While the ladyfingers are soaking, beat the egg yolks with  the sugar until the yolks turn pale in color. Add the mascarpone, the  liquors, and the extract, and stir gently.    In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a wire whisk until they are  stiff.  Gently fold the whites into the mascarpone mixture.    Use half of this mixture to make a layer on top of the ladyfingers in the  serving dish.  Sprinkle with half of the chopped chocolate. Repeat the  procedure with another layer of soaked ladyfingers, the mascarpone mixture,  and chocolate.  Cover with tin foil and refrigerate for at least 1 hour  before serving.
