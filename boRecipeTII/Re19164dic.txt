Vegetable Marinade 3
Mill ground mustard, Red wine vinegar or, olive oil, 
If you use balsamic vinegar in this recipe (if you dont, add some honey to  sweeten it) you will get a pretty glaze. This is great with broiled or  roasted peppers as well as root vegatables. Remeber, you can grill almost  any non-leafy vegetable. I am sure this recipe also works well with  broccoli or cauliflower. Experiment and enjoy!
