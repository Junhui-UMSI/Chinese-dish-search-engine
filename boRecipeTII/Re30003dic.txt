This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a  fraction of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats,  sugar, and nuts. The results will fool anyone.    1. Combine pistacho nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small  bowl. Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to  prevent from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased  13x9" baking sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly  with nut mixture. Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing  after every third sheet and top sheet.  2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form pattern of  about 35 diamond shapes. Bake at 400F. 25 minutes or until golden.  Place on wire rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over top  and allow to soak several hours. Stud each diamond-shape with whole  clove.    Each piece baklava with syrup contains about: 85 calories; 32mg  sodium; 0 cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 9 grams carbohydrate; 2 grams  protein; trace fiber.    Exchanges: 1/2 bread; 1/2 fat.
