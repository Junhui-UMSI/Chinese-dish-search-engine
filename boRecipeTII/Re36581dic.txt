Strawberry Apple Pie
strawberries, Granulated sugar, Cornstarch, Apples, Brown sugar, 
Heres another recipe from the Great American Recipes. Havent tried it  YET, but strawberries are in season and this looks good.    Mix sliced strawberries and chopped apples. Blend together sugars and  cornstarch. Mix with fruit for filling, toss gently. Pour pie fillig into  unbaked pie shell, top with remaining crust. Bake pie at 375 deg F for  about 45 minutes or until crust is lightly brown and apples are soft.    The directions dont indicate this, but the picture looks like they  sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Either that or its my eyes!!
