Chickpeas a la Provencial (r D)
Chickpeas  , Olive Oil, Leeks, Water, Spinach, Garlic, Herbes De Provence, salt and pepper, Seasoned Croutons, 
*I adjusted this recipe    Note 1: soak dried chickpeas overnight, drain. Note 2: Original recipe used      1/2 c  olive oil    Saute in olive oil the leeks (or onions). Add water, add chickpeas,  spinach, stir well.    Add herbs de Provence, garlic, salt and pepper, cook about 15 min.  (Original directions said to Let cool, then blend. Reheat to serve.) I  didnt let it cool or blend it ... we just ate it as is. Put in bowls with  croutons.
