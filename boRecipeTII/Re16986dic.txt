Almond Butter Disks
Ground almonds, GLAZE, Kirsch, Sugar, Egg whites, Seedless raspberry preserves, Grated zest of 1 lemon, BATTER, Butter, Dark rum, Flour, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    Cream the softened butter and add the sugar in a stream. Continue beating  until the butter/sugar whitens. Beat in the zest and rum, then the egg  whites, one at a time, beating smooth between each addition. Mix the  almonds and flour together and stir them into the batter by hand.    Pipe the batter on paper lined pans in 1-inch mounds using a 1/2-inch plain  tube. Bake the cookies for 12 to 15 minutes.    For the glaze:    Bring the preserves and the Kirsch to a boil in a small pan over medium  heat, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Apply glaze while it  is still very hot.    Cool the cookies on the paper and sandwich them with raspberry glaze after  they have cooled.
