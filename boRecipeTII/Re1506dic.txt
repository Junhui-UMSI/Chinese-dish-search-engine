Bread Pudding (very low fat)
Raisins, EnerG (egg sub.), Sugar, Salt, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Warm skim milk, Vanilla, Sugar, White bread, 
Preheat oven 325F. Toast the bread and slice into cubes. Spray an 8" square  pan and arrange the bread in the pan, sprinkling the raisins on top. In a  small bowl, mix the EnerG according to directions. Add the spices, vanilla,  1/3 cup sugar and milk, stirring to combine. Pour over the bread and let  stand for 30 minutes, pressing down occasionally on the bread to absorb the  liquid. Sprinkle with 1 tsp sugar, then bake 50-60 minutes until golden  brown and puffed up. Serve warm or cold.    Variations: Use chopped apricots instead of raisins. Spread the bread with  jam before cutting. Add the grated zest of an orange to the liquid.
