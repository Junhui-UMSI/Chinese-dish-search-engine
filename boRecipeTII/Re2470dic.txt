Sift Rice Krispies with confectioners sugar. Pour into the peanut butter  mixture and mix with a wooden spoon. Shape into balls. (I make the balls  small, about 1/2". The bon bons are so rich that if they are bigger, it is  quite a mouthful.) Form all of the mixture into balls while it is still  warm. After the mixture has cooled, it is very hard to form additional  balls. Melt chocolate chips and shortening together over a low flame until  chips are melted. Dip bon bons in chocolate, turning to coat all over.  Place coated balls on a wax paper lined cookie sheet. freeze until firm. (I  do this in shifts.)    Note #1: These freeze well. Keep frozen until about 15 - 20 minutes before  you are ready to serve them.    Note #2: Insert a toothpick into the center of each ball in order to easily  dip in the chocolate. This usually works very well.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by dsabraham@juno.com (Deena Abraham) on Nov  29, 1998,
