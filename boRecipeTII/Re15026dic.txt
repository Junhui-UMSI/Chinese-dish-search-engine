Wash and dry chicken pieces. Brown in heated oil in a large skillet until  golden on all sides. With tongs, remove from skillet and set aside. To  drippings in skillet, add onion, garlic, green pepper, and salt; saute  until lightly browned; add saffron and salt and cook until vegetables are  soft. Add rice, stir to coat evenly with oil. Return chicken to skillet.  Add tomato pieces, chorizo, chicken broth, sherry and shrimp; bring to  boil. Lower heat and simmer, covered, stirring once or twice, for about 20  minutes or until half the liquid is absorbed. Add the frozen peas or  artichokes and simmer about 15 minutes longer, or until all ingredients are  tender and most of the liquid is absorbed. If using mussels, you can steam  them in a little water until the shells open and use as garnish.    This is a very basic recipe for paella. There are endless variations and  combinations that accomodate any taste or availability. Hot peppers, canned  pimientos and/or capers suit some tastes. Ground coriander (1/2 teaspoon)  or oregano (1 teaspoon) can be used in seasoning. Clams can be substituted  for mussels, and often one finds both shrimp and clams and mussels in a  good paella. Fresh coriander leaves on top are a fine addition. Good  accompaniments are fried plantains, green salad, French bread.
