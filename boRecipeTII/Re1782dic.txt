Chicken Breast Supreme
Onion, grated, Garlic powder, Toothpicks, Large boneless chicken, Salt, Black pepper, olive oil, Butter, Slices of baby swiss cheese, Spears of asparagus, 2 or 3 sour cream, Mushroom or mushroom pieces, Thin slices of deli ham, 
Place chicken breasts halves between sheets of wax paper or plastic wrap.  Pound slightly with mallet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbs of  olive oil in large skillet.  Cook chicken over high heat for 4 minutes on  each side.  Don not cook longer or they will be over-cooked and dry.  Transfer to baking pan. Prepare asparagus. In a small pan, cook in water  until tender. Drain. To assemble, place one piece of ham on each chicken  breast and top with one slice of baby swiss cheese and two spears of  asparagus. Fold breast over and close with toothpick. Bake at 350 degrees  for 15 to 20 minutes. For sauce, saute onions and mushrooms in skillet in  remaining butter and 1 teaspoon olive oil until onions are clear. Add sour  cream and garlic powder. Heat until warm, stirring constantly. Pour sauce  over chicken and serve immediately.    Recipe by Sue Thatcher; as published in the Cedar Rapids Gazette 19Nov94    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by q591b4@ilos.net on Oct 26, 1998
