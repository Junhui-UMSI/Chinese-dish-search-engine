Butter, Oranges; thinly sliced, Cornstarch, Vegetable oil, Grand mariner, Mango; sliced, Eggs, Heavy cream, Orange juice; freshly, Loaf french bread, Sugar, 
In large skillet, melt butter. Add sugar and cook until mixture is bubbly.  Add orange slices and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. In 1-cup  measuring cup or small bowl, combine orange juice and cornstarch.    Add orange juice mixture to butter mixture; cook, stirring constantly,  until sauce thickens slightly and becomes translucent. Remove sauce from  heat; pour into serving bowl and keep sauce warm.    With bread knife, cut bread crosswise into four 1 1/2 inch thick slices.  With a sharp knife, make an incision horizontally to center of bread to  create a pocket. Stuff each pocket with 1/4 cup mango, being careful not to  poke a hole through top of bottom of each bread slice.    In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. In pie plate or wide-mouthed  bowl, combine eggs, cream, and Grand Mariner. Dip stuffed bread slices into  egg mixture until bread is saturated. Reduce heat to low and fry bread  slices, in batches if necessary, turning once to brown both sides, about 7  minutes per side. Cut slices in half diagonally and place 2 halves onto  each of 4 serving plates. Spoon orange sauce over stuffed bread slices and  serve.
