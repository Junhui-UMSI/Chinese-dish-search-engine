Place the springform  sides over the baked base.  Roll the remaining dough 1/8 inch thick and cut  to fit the sides of the pan, pressing firmly to fit and seal the base. Trim  the dough to come only 3/4 inches up the sides.    Turn oven up to 550 degrees.    Cream cheese with sugar and flour until smooth.  Add eggs and two addi-  tional yolks one at a time and blend. Add the flavorings and cream, mix  well, and pour into prepared springform. Bake at 550 degrees for 10 to 12  minutes, then reduce temperature to 200 degrees and continue to bake for  one hour.  Cool the cake to room temperature before glazing. Submitted By  SAM WARING <SAM.WARING@382-91-12.IMA.INFOMAIL.COM>  On MON, 13 NOV 1995   132305    GMT
