Scald milk, stir in sugar, salt, butter and cool to lukewarm. Combine  water and yeast in a large bowl, stir until dissolved. Beat in milk  mixture and egg. Add half the flour, beat until smooth. Stir in  remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Add more flour if necessary.  Cover tightly and refrigerate dough at least 2 hours. It may be  refrigerated up to 3 days. Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured  roll out one half to a 9x18" rectangle. Brush with half the melted  butter. Sprinkle half the cherry mixture over dough, pat lightly.  Starting with an 18" edge, fold 1/3 of dough to center. Then fold  over remaining 1/3 of dough to make a 3-layer strip. Pinch to seal  edges. Cut each strip into 8 sections. Make 4 slashes through a cut  edge of each section.  Place on a greased baking sheet, and shape  into bear claws by separating the slashes.  Repeat using remaining  dough and cherry mixture. Blend yolk and water, brush onto rolls.  Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup nuts and 2 tablespoons sugar. Let  rise about 10 minutes, and bake until golden brown.    CHERRY MIXTURE Make this recipe while the Sweet Rich Dough is rising.  Drain and chop cherries, drain again on paper towels. Combine chopped  cherries, dates, raisins, lemon peel, the 1/2 cup walnuts, and 2  tablespoons sugar.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
