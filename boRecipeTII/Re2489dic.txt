Braised Kale, Potatoes and Mushrooms
Shallots, red potatoes, Kale, salt and pepper, Water, portobello, Garlic, olive oil, 
Place potatoes in a medium saucepan of salted water. Bring to a boil,  reduce heat, and simmer until tender, about 7-10 minutes. Drain and set  aside. In a large wide skillet, heat oil over medium heat. (I imagine you  could use wine, broth or water for the saute). Add mushrooms, shallots, and  garlic and cook stirring often until shallots are soft and mushrooms are  tender, about 5 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. Add kale to mushrooms  and cook stirring often, 1 minute. Add water and cooked potatoes. Cover and  cook until kale is bright green, about 5 minutes.
