Saffron strands, Lemon; thinly pared rind,, Black Pepper, Parsley, Washed and trimmed leeks, Long-grain brown rice, olive oil, Frozen peas, Garlic, Light Vegetable Stock, Onion; peeled and sliced, Salt, Black olives, or more, TO GARNISH, 
Heat the oil in a large, deep pan.  Add the long-grain brown rice and onion  slices and stir until the rice is coated and begins to turn opaque. Add the  garlic, saffron, stock or wate, lemon rind and salt and pepper. Mix well,  then bring to a boil. Mix again, to distribute the saffron coloring.  Arrange the vegetables and olives attractively on top of the rice. Bring to  a boil.  Cover with a lid or foil and simmer for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with  parsley and serve straight from the pan. May be served with blanched  almonds, slivered Brazil nuts or whole cashew nuts- separately, in a bowl -  for people to help themselves to if they like. Variation: VEGETARIAN PAELLA  WITH ARTICHOKES: Use 4 to 6 globe artichokes instead of the leeks. Very  tender baby artichokes can simply be quartered; otherwise cut the leaves  and choke from the artichokes, then halve or quarter the artichoke bottoms.  Garnish with artichoke leaves.
