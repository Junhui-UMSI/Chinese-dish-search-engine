olive oil, Margarine, Garlic, Dry white wine, Capers, Black pepper, Thyme, Turkey breast, Chicken broth, Bay leaf, Fresh parsley, 
* For this recipe, you will need about 1-1/2 pounds of turkey breast  tenderloin steaks, cut into 8 slices.    1. Place each turkey steak between sheets of waxed paper and pound with  meat mallet until about 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper if  desired. Use a heavy skillet large enough to hold all turkey slices in one  layer or use 2 skillets. 2. Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the  margarine. Add turkey, garlic, bay leaf and thyme. (Use sprigs of thyme if  using fresh.) Cook over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes or until  lightly browned on both sides. Do not overcook. 3. Remove turkey to serving  platter and keep warm. Leave other ingredients in pan. Add the wine to pan  and cook over high heat until reduced to half. Stir often to mix in the  brown particles in skillet. Add the broth and boil until reduced by half.  4. Stir in remaining margarine, capers and chopped parsley if using. Add  the turkey back to the skillet and reheat briefly. Remove bay leaf before  serving.
