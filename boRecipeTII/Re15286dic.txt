Taste for seasonings and add more herbs or lemon juice if necessary. Spread  mixture on 4 slices of bread.  Cover remaining 4 slices with layer of  slightly overlapping cucumber slices. Top with lettuce or sprouts. Grams of  fat/serving: 0.6    Hummus makes a great filling too, though the garlic keeps me from taking it  to lunch.  I work closely with people and feel like I am one big clove of  garlic!    fatfree digest V96 #191    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
