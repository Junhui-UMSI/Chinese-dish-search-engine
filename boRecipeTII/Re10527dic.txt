Cover  and cook for about 15 minutes; set aside. In a large skillet, cook carrots,  zucchini, and yellow squash in butter just until softened, about 2 to 3  minutes. Add wine and cook for 2 minutes more; set aside and keep warm. Add  remaining 1/2 cup broth to hot rice over medium-high heat, stirring until  broth is absorbed. Stir in cooked vegetables, cheese and pepper. Serve  immediately.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MealMaster recipe list.
