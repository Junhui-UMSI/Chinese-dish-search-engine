Zucchini Parmesan Latkes
Russet potatoes, peeled, Lemon juice, Zucchini, Sugar, Eggs, Chopped parsley, Chopped scallions, Grated Parmesan cheese, Peanut oil for frying, Salt, Flour, Pepper, Garlic, 
Grate the zucchini and potatoes and toss in the lemon juice to prevent  browning. Squeeze the zucchini and potatoes through towels or a sieve. It  is imperative that you get almost all the moisture out of the vegetables.    Add the scallions, cheese, garlic, 1/2 cup of the parsley, salt and pepper,  sugar, flour, and eggs and toss to make sure that the ingredients are well  mixed.    Heat a 1/2 inch of peanut oil in a pan until hot and add thin silver  dollar-size pancakes, frying over high heat until golden brown and crispy.  When serving, sprinkle with a little more salt and the remaining chopped  parsley.
