Ail Ou Echalotes Confits (Garlic or Shallots in Duck Fat)
Quatre epices (5 spices), Graisse de canard, Pepper, Black, ground, Shallots, 
1. Peel the garlic and cut off any green sprouts within. If using shallots,  cut off both ends before peeling. Heat the duck fat in a small saucepan  over medium flame.    2. When the fat is warm, add the garlic or shallots, the quatre epices, and  the ground pepper. Cook until they are soft, about 20 minutes for the  garlic and 30 minutes for the shallots.    3. Remove them from the fat with a slotted spoon and cool on paper towels.  If they are not used immediately, they can be refrigerated in a small  container for several days.  Do not cover them with fat. Yield - 6 servings  as a garnish.    [ Per serving: 30 calories, 0 g. protein, 2 g. carbohydrate, 2 g. fat, 2  mg. cholesterol, o mg. sodium.
