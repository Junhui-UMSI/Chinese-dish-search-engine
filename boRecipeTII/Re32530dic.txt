Sweet Fried Rice with Almonds and Cinnamon
Of vanilla, Water, Peanut oil, Cinnamon, Ground cloves, Sugar, Salt, Whole almonds, Mixed dried fruit, diced, Rice, Butter, Thinly sliced onion, 
Heres an unusual use of the wok.  I dont usually think of fried rice and  fruit going together...    Soak the dried fruit in the water with 1 teaspoon of the vanilla for 40  minutes.    Heat the oil in a wok; add almonds and stir-fry until toasted, about 1  minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon.    Reduce the heat to moderate and add 2 tablespoons of the butter.    Add the onions and stir-fry until lightly browned.    Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and continue to stir-fry until the sugar is melted  and lightly caramelized.    Add 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon and the dried fruit mixture. Stir- fry for        1    minute.  Remove to a bowl.    Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the wok; add rice, remaining  vanilla, sugar and the salt.  Stir-fry until rice is in separate grains and  some grains have toasted lightly.    Push the rice up the sides of the wok and pour the fruit in the center. Mix  in the rice.    Turn out onto a platter and decorate with the toasted almonds.    Sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon mixed with cloves.    Serves 4.    San Francisco Chronicle, 2/6/91.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg; February 13 1991.
