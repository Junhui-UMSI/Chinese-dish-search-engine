Phillip Graebing wrote that he had lost his blueberry recipes. I have a  cookbook called "The Blueberry Connection" - 209 pages of nothing but  blueberry recipes. Being its that time of the year, hopefully some of the  following will refresh Phillips files    Dissolve gelatin in boiling water. Add sugar, juice and lemon rind. Chill  until syrupy. Whip chilled milk. Fold berries and whipped milk into chilled  syrup mixture. Pour into baked pie shell. Chill. Ymmmy! "The cultivated  blueberry has been on the market for only about 45 years. It is, indeed, a  20th century child."    Posted to EAT-L Digest 24 Aug 96    From:    Pat Belanger <cookie@CWCONNECT.CA>    Date:    Sun, 25 Aug 1996 19:25:44 -0700
