From: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich)    Date: 20 Jul 96 04:57:51 -0800  Hi!  I was making Amparos rice and it suddenly occurred to me that you  would probably really enjoy it.  That is assuming I am right that you are  one of the chili-heads? I am not on the list and I doubt that this recipe  has made it there (possible tho - my brother is on the net and he should be  on the list). Anyway, here it is. If you like, pass it on the list. It is  probably not as hot as some of you like but substitute hotter peppers or  skim milk for some of the cream and it will heat up. As it is, I use 1  pepper and, if I want it really mild, I skip the peeling process and just  core it.  As a side note, today I used 2 old sandwich bags instead of  gloves, one became the garbage sack and the other is now in the freezer  with 3 small strips of pepper for next weeks stir fry.    (Bahia de Kino, Sonora, Mexico)    Peel and core 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers.  Cut pepper into narrow strips.  Place on top of 1 cup (I use Basmati) rice in a star pattern.  Add 1 cup  milk and 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of half and half. Salt to taste. Bake for  about 1 hour at 350 degrees or until milk is gone and rice is soft. Serve  hot.
