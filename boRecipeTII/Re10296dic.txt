Quick Bean and Rice Salad

I adapted a Bean and Rice Salad recipe from the McDougall Program for  Maximum Weight Loss to make it quicker. Those of you who are looking for  something quick to make for the family, or want something fairly portable  in a cooler, this is a good one. Very satisfying, and a complete protein.  This was another invaluable recipe that saw me through my pregnancy. I kept  a bowl of it in the refrigerator pretty regularly so I could just scoop  some up for a quick meal.    Empty the bag of frozen salad into a strainer and run cold water over it  for about 30 seconds to start the thawing process. Toss all the ingredients  together, let sit for at least an hour so the flavors blend, and youve got  a great side dish or a satisfying main dish. Good for picnics, potlucks,  you name it!
