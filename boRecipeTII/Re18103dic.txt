Put all ingredients in machine according to your manufacturers    specifications.  Select Basic Bread Cycle, light crust.  Be    sure the vegetables are cooled.    Watch the water content on the vegetables for this one so that your dough  is not too wet.  You simply check the dough after the machine has been on,  at about the 5 minute level.  If the dough is too loose and wet, add more  flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it pulls from the side and lumps more  firm and smooth like it should.  Not a loaf recommended for the first time    user.      This is one recipe I have really played with; and, with happy    results.  It makes a great vegetable sandwich; a lovely compliment    for soups, stews, or little teas sandwiches spreach with cream    cheese and fresh dill/olive slice garnish.  Play with this one...    some suggestions follow:      *gluten additive     helps from dough elasticity  I dont use this.                         If I want a higher loaf, I usually lower the                         salt.  I found no need for gluten in this loaf.     **oregano, dried      I love fresh herbs and personally use the 2                         fresh to 1 dried conversions  Finely chop or                         process fresh herbs in mill, processor or blender.                         I have used basil or dill with wonderful results.  ***onion, dry mince    I love fresh onions.  I normally use fine chopped                         scallion (dont forget the stems), or white onions.                         Be aware fresh ones might affect the shelf life of                         this loaf.  I never have any left over after the                         sandwich mentioned above. Makes my mouth water!                         I have use the dried minced onion flakes.  You                         get a slight crunchy texture.    ****vegetable puree     To be honest this I have not done.  I did not want                         a "colored" bread...but a "confetti bread".  The                         pretty flecks of a fine dice broccoli/carrot and/                         or corn is sooooooo pretty.  I carefully drain                         the vegetables and pat very dry.  I then carefully                         dice them down in the processor to look like                         confetti bits.  You could use all green vegies,                         cabbage or a fine chopped fresh spinach leaf.                         be aware of your storage desires.  The puree would                         last one or two days longer, I am sure.    *****Lecithin            I have never added this.  It acts as a  preservative                         in this application.  In health applications it                         works on cholesterol and helps to break down fat                         and stimulate bile secretion for your liver.  You                         can buy capsules in your local food chain in the                         vitamin section, or use granuals.  Both will work.                         And, of coarse, theres the health food stores.    >From: Katie E Green <kgreen@u.washington.edu>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
