Vegetarian Lasagne (Dairy)
Egg, Box oven ready lasagne, Ricotta cheese, Mozerrella cheese (up to 4), Jar spaghetti sauce, Parmesan cheese, 
Mix the riccotta and the egg. You may season with basil and oregano if you  like.    Spread a little spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a microwave safe 9x13 pan.  Add 1 layer of noodles (as directed on the package). Top with 1/2 or 1/3 of  the ricotta cheese (depending on how many layers of noodles you want), some  mozerrella, and some more sauce. Repeat the layers until you run out of  ricotta. Top with another layer of noodles.    Cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high 15 minutes. Carefully remove  wrap, add a layer of mozerella and sprinkle some parmesan. Microwave 4 more  minutes or until cheese is bubbly.    Leftovers freeze well.    (My husband commented last night that he likes the new streamlined lasagne  better than the old oven version. I use the same recipe, just different  noodles and cook in the microwave instead of the oven. You could use  whatever recipe you like best and switch to these noodles and cook in 15  minutes.)
