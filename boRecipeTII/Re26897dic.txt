Source: "The Spice and Spirit" cookbook    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9 x 5 " loaf pan.  Combine all  the batter ingredients in a bowl and beat well. Pour half the batter into  the loaf pan.    Mix all filling ingredients in a separate bowl and beat well.  Pour filling  over batter.    Cover with second half of the batter.  Bake for one hour.  Let cool for 10  minutes.  Serve with applesauce or sour cream.    I add a little bit of cinnamon to the filling.  It is also good with  raisins added.
