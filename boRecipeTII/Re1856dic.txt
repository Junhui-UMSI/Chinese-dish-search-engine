Chicken with Red Wine Vinegar (Chicken Potacchio)
Frying chicken, olive oil, Salt and pepper, Garlic, Rosemary, Red wine vinegar, 
In a heavy fry pan with a tight cover, heat olive oil. Add chicken and salt  and pepper. Cook chicken quickly to a nice golden brown, stirring often.  Add garlic, rosemary, and vinegar. Lower heat, cover, and let cook gently  for 15-20 minutes. When chicken is fork tender, remove cover, turn up heat  to reduce liquid in pan, stirring chicken often to coat well with pan  juices. Usually served with crescia and sauteed escarole.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Paula <demoness@bellatlantic.net> on Sep  16, 1998
