Recipe By : Taste Show # TS4740    In a saucepan over high heat, reduce Asti Spumante to 1/4 cup. Set aside.  Combine gelatin with 2 tablespoons of cold water, set aside to soften.    Create a double boiler by setting a stainless steel bowl on top of a  saucepan half-filled with barely simmering water over low heat. Whisk  together yolks and sugar rapidly for 6 minutes, or until the yolks volume  has doubled and their color has lightened. Whisk gelatin into warm  sparkling wine. Whisk the mixture into the whipped yolks and place in the  refrigerator to cool. In a separate chilled bowl, whip heavy cream to stiff  peaks. When the wine mixture is cool to touch, fold in whipped cream until  smooth and thoroughly combined. Place mixture in a sealed container and  freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.    Serve warmed fruit compote -- apricot, peaches or nectarines -- in pretty  glass dishes. Spoon semifreddo onto fruit. Garnish with mint sprigs and  serve.
