Baby Food -- beef or, Cream Of Wheat, Chicken, Carrots, Dry milk powder, Jars, 
Combine ingredients in bowl and mix well. Roll into small balls and place  on well-greased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with a fork. Bake in  preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes until brown. Cool on wire racks  and STORE IN REFRIGERATOR.  Also freezes well. Another Prodigy member made  these substituing cream of wheat for wheat germ and then used tablespoon to  make cookie sized drops on plate. Microwaved for 4 minutes on Medium High.  Suggested keeping an eye on them in microwave and perhaps start out for  only 3 1/2 minutes. They do come out soft. Also suggested using  Beef/Vegetable Dinner Baby Dinner insted of Beef or Chicken.
