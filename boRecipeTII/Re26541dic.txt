In food processor fitted with chopping blade, process bacon, oil, garlic,  rosemary leaves, and pepper until a thick paste forms.    Heat oven to 475F. In shallow, open roasting pan, place capon, breast side  up, on wire rack. With pastry bushs, spread bacon paste over entire surface  of capon. Place bay leaves and rosemary and thyme sprigs in cavity of  capon. Tuck wing tip under shoulder joints. Push drumsticks under band of  skin, if present, or with string, tie together.    Roast capon 25 minutes or until golden brown. Loosely cover capon with  aluminum foi. Reduce oven temperature to 350F and roast capon 2 1/2 to 3  hours longer or until meat thermometer inserted into inner thigh registers  180F.    Transfer capon to large serving platter. To make sauce, remove wire rack  and all fat from drippings in roasting pan. Pour in chicken broth and heat  to boiling over high heat. With wooden spoon, scrape bottom of pan to  loosen browned-on bits. Reduce heat to medium and cook 20 to 30 minutes or  until sauce is reduced by half. Pour into sauceboat.    To serve, garnish capo with bay leaves and herb sprigs, if desired. Serve  sauce on the side.    NOTES : A bacon and herb puree keeps the capon moist and gives it a smoky  flavor.
