White-Cooked Pressed Pork
Water to cover, Salt, Pork, -(up to), 
1. Have pork boned, but kept intact. Wipe clean with a damp cloth; dry  with paper toweling; then rub with salt and refrigerate, covered, 2 days.       2. Wipe pork with a damp cloth to remove excess salt. Place in a heavy  pan with water. Bring to a boil; then simmer, covered, until tender (about  1-1/2 hours), turning meat several times. Drain, reserving liquid for  stock.       3. Squeeze pork snugly into a deep rectangular pan (like a cake pan) and  cover with a weighted tray. (Use heavy books or a kettle filled with water  for the weight.) Let stand until meat is compressed and rectangular (about  2 to 3 hours).       4. Remove weights and refrigerate pork to chill. Slice 1/4-inch thick,  then in rectangles 1-1/2 inches wide and 2 inches long. Serve cold with  dips for plain-cooked pork. (See recipes "Soy-Sesame Dip for Pork",  "Soy-Mustard Dip for Pork", "Chili-Soy Dip for Pork", or "Hoisin Dip for  Pork").       VARIATIONS: After step 1, add to the pork 1/2 cup sherry and 1 clove  star anise. Refrigerate a third day, turning meat several times. Drain;  reserve marinade and combine it with enough cold water to make 3 cups.  Bring to a boil as in step 2. Continue as above.       In step 3, wrap pork in a clean cloth. Place on a plate and top with a  weighted tray. Let stand overnight in a cool place, then refrigerate to  chill.    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4.
