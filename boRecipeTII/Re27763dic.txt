The Pfeiffer-Whites House Best Cookies
Oatmeal, Molasses, Sugar, Cinnamon, Vanilla, Flour, Crisco shortening, Baking soda, Egg, Salt, Chocolate chips, 
Combine all ingredients. Bake at 350F for approximately 8-10 minutes. Do  not overcook. Marilyn allows for exactly 9 minutes in her oven. Make  certain that you check at 8 minutes. They will look almost undercooked.  Remove from oven when they are just turning tan on top, yet still soft.  Yields 4 dozen.

Awaiting every guest in his or her room  is "a jar of these cookies along with a basket of fruit. Guests seem to  really enjoy the homemade and old-fashioned taste, and they are always a  topic of conversation!"
