He was in the United  States and I was living with my parents in South America.    Cream butter. Gradually add sugar and continue beating. Add beaten eggs.  Mix currants and candied orange peel with flour before slowly adding to  butter mixture. Pour into a greased and floured small (7X3X2 inch) loaf  pan. Bake at 275 degrees for 1 hour or until done and slightly brown.  Remove from pan. Wrap in aluminum foil while still warm. Cake keeps moist  for several days. Four times this recipe makes 3 large loaves (9X5X2  in).ch).    Variation:  Use 1 cup chocolate chips instead of the candied orange peel  and citron.
