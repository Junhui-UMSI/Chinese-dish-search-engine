Zabaglione #3
sweet Marsala wine, Granulated sugar, Egg yolks, 
1. In the bottom half of a double boiler, bring about 2 inches of water to  a simmer. It is most important that the water not be too hot, and that the  top half not touch the waters surface.    2. Beat the egg yolks and sugar together in the top half, using a strong,  balloon-type whisk.    3. Slowly add the Marsala to the egg mixture, continuing to beat about 4 to  6 minutes until custard becomes thick and fluffy. Pile into long-stemmed  glasses and serve at once. This particular type of Italian dessert should  always be served hot. You must use great caution to see to it that the  water does not come in contact with the egg yolk mixture, or you will have  scrambled sweet eggs. Other than that, it is very easy.
