submitted by: rayna@iconz.co.nz, From Rayna in New Zealand  Below is a national favorite of New Zealand.  Many of the favorite and well  used recipes are English based!  Let me know if you try it, what you think.  When my daughter visited from California - she asked for this recipe. Take  care and happy spring.    Use one sheet of pastry to line a 20 cm square shallow cake tin.  (8 inch)  Sprinkle onion, bacon and mixed vegetables evenly over pastry.  Dot the  chutney on top.  Break eggs evenly over, pricking the yolks so they run  slightly.  Carefully lift second sheet of pastry over filling.  Brush top  with milk. Bake at 200C (400 F) for 40 minutes or until well risen and  golden.   To serve - cut into squares. Serve hot or cold. Serves 6.
