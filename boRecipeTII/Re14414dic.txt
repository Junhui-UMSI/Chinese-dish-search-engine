Whole Wheat Dill Bread
Sugar, Baking soda, Gluten, Olive oil; - or butter, Plain Non-Fat Yogurt, Whole wheat bread flour, Ctn  eggbeaters ;-, Salt; - (I use Light Salt), -water, Whole dill SEED, Lecithin granules, White bread flour, Non-fat Cottage Cheese, Yeast; - or 2 1/2 tsp., Onion; minced dried, 
Warm together the water; cottage cheese, yogurt, sugar, onion, dill seed  and oil in microwave for about 30 seconds or until warm to the touch (about  110 deg). Set aside. Place all other ingredients above into the bread pan  in order listed. Add warmed ingredients. Select white bread setting (other  brands of B/Ms may have a whole wheat setting), but the white bread  setting works on the DAK. Set light/dark setting on side of B/M to 11  oclock. Press Start. Open lid after dough has kneaded about 2 mins. Press  dough lightly with fingertip. If wet, sticky dough adheres to your  fingertip OR dough is not forming into one soft ball (NO sticky dough on  bottom of pan), add 1 Tablespoon or more flour until dough is just slightly  tacky and makes one soft ball of dough. Judy Garnett --- Hope this does  well for you. I use my elec. knife to slice the bread top to bottom down  the center first. Then place the two cut sides down and slice them thin.  This makes a great sandwich bread or is good toasted with a little diet  margarine spread.
