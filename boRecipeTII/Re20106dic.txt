Stir constantly  until the mixture reaches a temperature of 155 F. or until it coats the  back of the spoon. Remove from heat, stir in cream and vanilla. Continue  stirring occasionally until the mixture has cooled to about 90 F. This will  take about 5 minutes if done over ice. Turn into the freezer can and  freeze.
