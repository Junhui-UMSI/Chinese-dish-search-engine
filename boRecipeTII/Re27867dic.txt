As  soon as the basic ingredients are down, this sauce can be made in large  batches to be frozen for later.    NOTE: The quantities of herbs and spices can be varied, depending on taste.  I usually measure them by estimation (i.e. no measuring spoons).    Brown sausages until firm. Remove from heat and slice into inch-wide  pieces. Brown ground meat. Drain. Add, in this order, tomato paste, sauce,  and whole tomatoes with juice to meats. Throw in herbs and spices. Stir. If  sauce is too thick, add up to 1 1/2 cups of water. Cook 30 min. to two  hours. The sauce gets better the longer it cooks.    Prepare spaghetti. When noodles are ready, top with sauce & parmesan  cheese.
