Ardshane House Irish Stew
Beef stock, Pearl barley, Potatoes, Middle neck of lamb, Onions, salt and pepper, 
"Thats the basic recipe. You can add a load of sliced carrots and leeks  to make it go further and about 5-6 tsps. of Worchestershire sauce or  regular brown sauce wot you Yanks pour over everything!! If you like, you  could add a half a pint of Guinness to your stock. I make my stock from  the potato peelings, carrot tops, leek ends, and any other stuff I find  lurking in the refrigerator. If you chuck in a few moldy lamb bones and  boil/simmer for several hours, you should get a damned good stock (strain  the liquid or youll get God knows what stuck in your teeth!!) Youll need  to start with about 5 pints of liquid. Then bung everything into a  ginormous pan, bring to the boil, and then simmer for about two  hours...should taste bloody orgasmic! Salt and pepper to taste, depending  on your level of drunkeness!!"    From:  Judith Caughey, Ardshane House, Holywood, Co. Down, N.
