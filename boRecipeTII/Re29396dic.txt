Baked Whole Garlic with French Bread
Cloves garlic; left whole, French bread loaf; sliced, Black pepper, Olive oil or clarified, Cream cheese or soft cheese, Salt, 
Heat the oven to 350F. Trim the tops of the garlic heads, leaving them  whole but removing about 1/4 inch. Remove excess dry skins. Rub the heads  with a little of the butter or oil and put in a very small baking dish or  crock the size of the four heads. Drizzle with the rest of the oil or  butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover loosely, reduce heat to 275F  and bake for 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake for about 1 hour and 15  minutes. Slice and heat the French bread (optional) in the last 10 minutes  of the baking garlic.    To serve: Spread French bread with soft creamy cheese (optional) or butter  and squeeze clove by clove onto the bread and spread it.    NOTES : Barely sweet and mild roasted garlic spread on French bread slices.  Each clove is squeezed out of its skin onto the bread. It can be served by  itself with the bread or with butter, cream cheese or soft cheese.
