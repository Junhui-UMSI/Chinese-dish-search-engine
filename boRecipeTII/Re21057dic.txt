Recipe By: The Palm Beach Post, November 17, 1994    Scrub and dry potatoes. Cut small, deep slit in top of each potato. Set  potatoes on middle rack of preheated 375-degree oven and bake for about 1  hour, or until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.    Let potatoes cool slightly, cut off tops and scrape pulp into a bowl. Dont  scrape so deeply that you tear the skin. Salt and pepper potato shells;  reserve.    Mash potato pulp and stir in chopped olives, diced chilies and enough cream  to give mixture the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and  pepper and stir in 1/2 cup grated cheese.    Divide potato mixture equally among shells, mounding filling slightly.  Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and place on baking sheet.    Bake again, at 400, until potatoes are hot and cheese is bubbling.    Top each potato with a generous dollop of sour cream and add a black olive  if youd like. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.    gunterman@ccmailpc.ctron.com    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
