Prime Rib
Rib roast standing, 
Cooking times,  20 min/pound = rare.  30 min/pound = med. 40 min/pound  ??????? Sprinkle with garlic powder, thyme and marjoram. Roast uncovered  with a little water in the pan to keep the roast from drying out.   Forgot to say at the start, use 325 Degrees.  Dont let the water >> dry  out in the bottom of the pan.   This is where you get your top quality au jus to make a great gravy.  Youll never use a bouillon cube or a can of garbage gravy again. When the  roast is done scrape the browned drippings from the pan, add a little more  water and bring to a simmer.  Add a bit of corn starch in water and let it  thicken, stirring all the time so it doesnt get lumpy. Top quality meal  along with your other > potatoes, veggies and salad.   No one can give exact step by step ways to make a great meal. Youll have  to get into the idea of cooking and spend time doing it. Youll find  yourself doing your own little things and making top quality food. FROM:  JOHN SLUIS   (KBCW96B)
