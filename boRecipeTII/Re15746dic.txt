Cut mushrooms, abalone, ham and pork all in strips, but keep them  separate. Mince ginger root.       4. Combine cornstarch, soy sauce and sherry. Add to pork and toss to  coat. Let stand a few minutes.       5. Heat oil. Add salt and ginger and stir-fry a few times. Add pork and  stir-fry until it loses pinkness. Remove from pan.       6. Meanwhile bring abalone-stock mixture slowly to a boil. Add mushrooms  and stir-fried pork. Simmer, covered, 10 minutes.       7. Add abalone, ham strips, pepper and remaining salt. Cook only to heat  through, about 2 minutes. (Dont overcook abalone; it will toughen.)       8. Garnish with a poached egg.       VARIATION: For the pork, substitute 1/2 cup chicken breast, cooked. Add  in step 6 after mushrooms have simmered 8 minutes, and cook only to heat  through.    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4. Downloaded  from G Internet, G Internet.
