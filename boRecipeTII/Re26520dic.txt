Here is the Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Bread recipe from "Bread Machine Magic"  by Lois Conway and Linda Rehberg aka "breakfast in a bread pan" for 1.5  pound loaf.......    1. In a skillet, cook bacon until crisp. Remove from pan, drain or pat with  paper towels, and reserve the drippings, crumble the bacon.    2. Place all ingredients in bread pan, using the least amount of liquid  listed in the recipe. Select light crust setting and press start.    3. Observe the dough as it kneads. After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry  and stiff or if your machine sounds as if it is straining to knead it, add  more liquid 1 tablespoon at a time until dough forms a smooth, soft,  pliable ball that is slightly tacky to the touch.    4. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack,  and allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.
