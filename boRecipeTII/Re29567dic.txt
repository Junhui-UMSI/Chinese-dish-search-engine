Tarte Aux Pignons
Eggs, Caster sugar (very fine), Ground almonds, Filling:, Finely grated zest of 1, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Orange flower water, Pine nuts, Honey, Puff pastry, 
Preheat the oven to 200 C/ 400 F. Roll the pastry out thinly and line a 8  or 9" tart tin with it, doubling the pastry over the rim and crimping it  securely. Pierce the base with a fork and rest it for half an hour in the  fridge. Cover with a square of buttered silver foil (butter side down) and  fill with baking beans. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the foil and  return to the oven for about 10 minutes to dry out. Leave to cool.    Mix the ground almonds with the orange zest and sugar. Make a well in the  centre and add the orange flower water, honey, eggs and olive oil. Mix  thoroughly to give a thick, smooth batter. Stir in two-thirds of the pine  nuts. Pour into the tart shell and sprinkle evenly with the remaining pine  nuts. Bake until browned and almost firm in the centre - about 20 to 25  minutes.

It comes from Antoine Bouterin, a Provencal chef who       now cooks at New       Yorks Le Perigord.
