Again this is traditionally cooked in a large deep wok, though unlike pla  jian it is cooked at very high heat.  Therefore, I caution you to use a  large skillet or an electric deep frier (though I have yet to see one of  them that gets the oil hot enough for the full effect of this recipe).    First the simple part; deep fry about a pound of mackerel or whiting,  preferably with the heads on, in smoking hot peanut oil until the skin is  crisp. Place it on a serving platter.    Sauce: In a small saucepan, saute the garlic and shallots in a little oil,  then remove and set aside.  Pour off the oil, leaving only a thin film on  the pan. Return half the shallots and garlic to the pan, and add the other  ingredients.  Stir to dissolve the sugar and then simmer to thicken the  sauce. Add the remaining shallots and garlic, stir until heated through,  then pour it over the grilled fish. Colonel Ian F.
