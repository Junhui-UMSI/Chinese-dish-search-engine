"Cracker" Toffee Triangles
Graham crackers, Brown sugar, Butter or margarine, walnuts, Chocolate chips, 
Heat oven to 350 F.    Lightly but thoroughly grease bottom and sides of jelly roll pan (some  versions of the recipe specify lining the pan with foil and also greasing  the foil).    Line pan with crackers to cover completely in a single layer.    Stir butter and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium heat until  butter has melted, sugar is dissolved, and mixture is blended and thickened  slightly (no longer than 3 minutes!).    Pour hot mixture over crackers, spreading to cover them completely. Bake 8  minutes (no longer!). Remove from oven. Wait a few seconds for topping to  stop bubbling, and then sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over surface. When  the chips have melted, spread the chocolate evenly over the crackers (now  one giant piece!). Sprinkle chopped nuts over all.    When chocolate has set, cut cookies: Make three lengthwise cuts and five  crosswise cuts to make twenty-four 2 1/2 inch squares. Cut squares on the  diagonal to make 48 triangular cookies.    Per cookie (with graham base) 100 cal, 1 g pro, 11 g car, 6 g fat, 5 mg  chol with butter, 45 mg sodium.    These are delicious. And no one ever guesses how easy they are.
