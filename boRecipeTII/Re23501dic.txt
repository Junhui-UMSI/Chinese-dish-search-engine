Leg lamb;about 4 lb. --, Bay leaves -- broken in, olive oil, (CWBJ78A), Dried Oregano, Garlic -- crushed or, Salt, Boned, Dry white wine, NANCY BERRY, Lemon, Black pepper to taste, Pieces, Chopped, 
Cut lamb into 1 1/2 inch cubes and place in a non-reactive (glass or  earthenware) dish. Add remaining ingredients to lamb, mix well to coat  meat, and cover.  You   can also place all ingredients in a heavy plastic  bag and seal. Leave in refrigerator to marinate for 12-24 hours, stirring  meat occasionally. Lift lamb out of marinade and thread onto metal skewers.  Pieces of bay leaf may be placed between lamb cubes. Since most vegetables  have different cooking times, I would suggest that you skewer peppers,  onions, etc. separately and serve them together with the lamb. If you wish  these may be marinated also (in a separate bag.)  Cook under a hot broiler  or over glowing charcoal, turning and basting frequently with marinade. I  like this best medium rare. Keep checking the meat -- the cooking time will  vary because charcoal fires are so variable. Place on a platter and garnish  with parsley and lemon wedges. Serves 6-8.
