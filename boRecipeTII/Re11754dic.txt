Once each is browned, combine them  together into one pan and continue to cook slowly, covered. Add bay  leaf, salt and pepper at this time.    Cook eggplant next, followed by the zucchini, then the tomatoes with  the garlic.    In large pan, combine all ingredients and cook for 10 minutes. Serve  warm.    NOTE: Cooking time is approximately a half-hour for all the  vegetables. They are cooked separately to keep them from getting  water-logged. Ratatouille should not be mushy.
