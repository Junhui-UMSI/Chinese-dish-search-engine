Vegetable Quiche
JOYCE BURTON, Flour, Vegetable oil, Pepper, Cooked vegetables*, Onions, (PDPP83A), Baking Powder, Salt, Grated cheese, Eggs**, Evaporated skim milk, 
*Your choice--can be frozen or fresh **Can substitute Egg Beaters, etc.  Dump vegetables, cheese, and onion in a 10" pie pan sprayed with non-stick  spray. Blend remaining ingredients in blender and pour over vegetables and  cheese. Bake at 375 D. for 20-30 minutes. WW Exchange per serving: 2  protein (1 egg & 1 cheese), 1/2 milk, 1 fat, 30 optional calories. I  usually use Egg Beaters and omit the vegetable oil. This will also freeze  well.
