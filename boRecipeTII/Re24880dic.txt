In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and saute the onion until  translucent. Add the garlic, jalapeno chiles, cumin and oregano, and saute  for several minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Then add  the potatoes and cook until just tender. With a slotted spoon, remove 1 cup  of potatoes and reserve. Add the diced chicken and pooach gently in the  onion- chili- potato mixturer until chicken is cooked through. Remove from  the heat immediatly, transfer to a bowl, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid in  a small bowl. Refrigerate the remainder to keep the chicken from  overcooking. In a blender, puree the reserved potatoes, half half the  Anaheim and half the poblano chilies, and the cilantro with the reserved  half cup of liquid. When the chicken mixture is no longer warm, add the  puree. Dice the remaining half of the Anaheim and poblano chilies in half  inch cubes and add to the mixture. Season with salt. Reheat just before  serving to retain the fresh green color and flovor of the soup.    NOTES : This recipe makes a spicy soup with the consistancy of a hearty  chicken-vegetable soup.
