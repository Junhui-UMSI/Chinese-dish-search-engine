Rafas Cafe Mexicaon Homestyle Salsa
Granulated garlic, Pepper, Tomatoes, canned, water, olive oil, Serrano peppers, (16-20), Cilantro, chopped fresh, 
Heat heavy skillet (cast iron is good) over high heat until very hot. Cook  chilies in dry pan on all sides until skins pucker and char. Place roasted  chilies in plastic bag, seal and "sweat" chilies for 3 to 4 minutes.  (Longer sweating will overcook chiles.)    Remove chilies from bag and peeel under cold running water. (Be careful not  to touch eyes, lips or nose while handling chiles. Wash hands thoroughly to  remove the fiery juices.) Discard Skin. Make small slit on side and remove  seeds, veins and stems.    Place chilies and 1 can tomatoes in blender. Pulse a few times, just enough  to break up tomatoes. Do not puree. Pour into large bowl.    Pulse remaining tomatoes, 1 can at a time, and add to bowl. Add salt,  granulated garlic, pepper, olive oil and cilantro. Stir to mix. Makes about        3    quarts.    Refrigerate unused salsa. It improves if made a day in advance    Recipe by: Dallas Morning News Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #619 by Thomas  Vath <tgvath@airmail.net> on May 25, 97
