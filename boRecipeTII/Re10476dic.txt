Hoisin sauce brings Asian taste to chicken    By Jean Kressy, Globe Staff, 03/11/98    Ground bean sauces such as hoisin are used all over China. Made from  fermented soybeans, sugar, and garlic, hoisin sauce is used for marinades,  stir-fries, and dipping. Its sweet and spicy flavors add a distinctively  Asian taste to this simple chicken dish. Once you open the jar, store  hoisin in the refrigerator, where it will keep indefinitely. This recipe  goes well with steamed rice.    In a small bowl, combine the broth, hoisin sauce, cornstarch, sugar, sesame  oil, and garlic. Whisk to combine.    Lightly coat the chicken with bread crumbs. In a large nonstick skillet,  heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden  brown on both sides, about 6 minutes. Add the vermouth, cover, and  thoroughly cook the chicken over low heat, about 10 minutes. Remove the  chicken to serving plates. Whisk the broth mixture again and add to the  skillet. Cook over high heat, stirring to remove any brown particles on the  bottom, until the sauce bubbles and is lightly thickened. Spoon over the  chicken.    Serves 4.
