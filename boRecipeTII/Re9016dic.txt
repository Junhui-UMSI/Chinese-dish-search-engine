Prickly Pears
See below, 
Prickly pear fruit is ripe in August in Tucson, and needs to be ripe for  good results. The purple fruit is best. Be sure to use a long-handled fork  or tongs to pick fruit, since besides the visible thorns, there are small,  hairlike "stickers" which are painful and hard, if not impossible, to  remove. If you cannot finish processing to jelly or whatever when fruit is  ripe, boil, strain and freeze juice until later (6 mos. max.).
