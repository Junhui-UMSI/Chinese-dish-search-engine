Zucchini Crust Pizza (Merrilyn Vaughan)    This is something my mother makes which even *I* like [and I dont like  chini!]  Got her to send it to me just for you folks!    Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Press liquid out of squash. Throw out liquid.  Combine zucchini, eggs, flour and salt. Spread on a well greased 9" x 12"  baking sheet or 12" pizza pan.  Bake until firm.    Remove from oven.  Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Spread with  pizza sauce and favorite toppings. Sprinkle with your favorite cheese.  Return to oven. Bake until sauce is bubbly and cheese is melted, about 10  to 15 minutes.
