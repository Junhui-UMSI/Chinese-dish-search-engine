Havent made this for a couple of years, but its pretty tasty. Saute  onions in olive oil for five minutes or until tender.  Add spices and  saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in vinegar and sugars, then simmer, partly  covered for 15 minutes.    Blanch peaches slightly in boiling water for 1 minute.  Drain, peel  pit and slice.  Add to onion mixture and simmer just until tender.  Transfer with slotted spoon to sterilized mason jar.    Reduce syrup over high heat to 1 1/2 cups.  Add slowly to jars to  almost cover fruit.  Stir.  Fill jars slowly with syrup, cap loosely  and cool.    Tighten caps and let stand in dark place at least 2 weeks.    I dont remember where this came from, but I suspect that it was  either Gourmet or Sunset Magazine.  In my handwritten copy it also  called for 2 teaspoons ground cumin as well as one tablespoon.  I  omitted it above, but I think it should have been 2 teaspoons ground  coriander.    Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; May 2 1991.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/cberg2.zip
