Apple Butter
Unsweetened Applesauce, Brown sugar, Nutmeg, Allspice, Cloves, Granulated sugar, Apple Cider, Cinnamon, SPICES, 
The thicker skinned, late Summer and Fall apples produce a grainier  texture thats best for applesauce.  Stir applesauce, sugars, and cider together and cook in a slow oven (325  deg F.) for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.  Add spices. Return to oven and cook 1 hour more. Apple butter requires  long, slow cooking. (Can also be made in a crockpot.)
