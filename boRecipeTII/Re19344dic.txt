All purpose flour, Salt, Baking soda, Egg yolk, Ice water, Vegetable oil, Zucchini, Green pepper, Onion, Button mushrooms, Broccoli, 
Separate the onion into rings.  Steam the broccoli 5 minutes (or microwave a  few minutes).   In an electric blender combine the flour, salt, baking soda,  egg yolk, and water. Blend to mix. Let stand 15 minutes.   Heat 3 - 4 inches  of oil in a deep heavy kettle, deep-fat fryer, or electric wok until it  registers 375F / 190C on a deep-fat thermometer. Test batter consistency by  dipping one piece of vegetable and letting excess drip off. There should be  a light coating left on.   Dip and fry, a few at a time, in the hot oil until  golden. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in the oven heated to 250F / 130C / Gas Mark   until all are cooked.
