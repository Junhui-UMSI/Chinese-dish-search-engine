1. Saute the onion and celery in the oil in a covered non-stick saute pan  for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the cover, add the garlic, and continue to saute  until wilted and tender. (Do not brown.)    2. Add the matzo farfel and stir until lightly toasted.    3. Combine the seasonings, egg substitute, parsley and chicken broth in a  bowl.    4. Add to the matzo mixture, mix, and use to stuff the bird under the skin  and/or in the seasoned body cavity. Secure with toothpicks or metal  skewers.    Lindas note: I made this recipe in a greased casserole dish and baked it  (covered with foil) at 325 degrees F for approximately 45 minutes.  Uncovered it and continued baking until top was lightly browned.... I have  made the mushroom and nut variations- both were delicious.    VARIATIONS:    Mushroom Stuffing: Saute 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms with the onion. You  may add 1 tsp of crushed dried thyme or 1 tbsp of chopped fresh thyme to  this mixture.    Nut Stuffing: One cup coarsely chopped toasted walnuts and/or almonds may  be added to the onion with the matzo farfel.    Fruit Stuffing: Ten, drained pitted chopped prunes or apricots; 2 cups  peeled, cored and diced apples; 1/2 cup dark raisins may be added with the  seasonings and broth.
