Baileys Cheese Wafers
Salt, All-purpose flour, Grated swiss cheese, Unsalted butter; softened, Freshly ground white pepper, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Preheat oven to 350F degrees.    In a large bowl, cream the cheeses and butter. Stir in salt and white  pepper. Mix flour in thoroughly until you can make a ball. Divide dough in  half, then keep dividing in half until you have 32 small balls, rolling  them with your hands. Place the balls about 2 inches apart on an ungreased  cookie sheet and flatten slightly.    Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden. Remove with a spatula to a cooling  rack.
