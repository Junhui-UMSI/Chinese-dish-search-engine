Get up a little early and start this so the yeast has a chance to get to  bubbling. Getting all the lumps out a the start is not critical -- the  yeast will win over the lumps.    Cook on hot griddle and enjoy the smell. These are tender and great with  real maple syrup.    * I usually omit the oil and use cooking spray on the griddle to lower the  "F" rating.    Notes: Works great with unbleached white flour, wholewheat pastry flour,  mixtures of flour, etc.    Use of beer in flapjack back in the "old days" provide yeast for the  pancakes. With the current microfiltered beer, yeast has to be added.    Beer can be replaced with milk -- most of the alcohol does cook off, but  Ficks Law rules and all will not leave in the time that a pancake cooks.  (yes I did a masters thesis on gas exchange in liquid) Those with alcohol  sensitivity should use milk or water.    Increase the oil, or use cooking spray on the irons to make waffles.
