If you dont have a pasta machine, roll the dough with a rolling pin on a  large, very smooth work surface. Allow time for the dough to rest while  rolling it. Whenever it springs back, cover it to prevent drying, let it  rest for 10 to 15 minutes, then continue to roll it larger. Your noodles  will probably be thicker than machine-rolled ones but still delicious. For  leaf pastas, the dough should be evenly thick, no more than 1/8 inch,  before you place the herb leaves between the layers. The finished pasta  should be about 1/16 inch thick.    To cut fat and cholesterol from egg pasta, use three egg whites from  extra-large eggs in place of two whole eggs. You may have to sprinkle in a  little water or extra flour.    EGG PASTA    Makes about 2/3 pound, 4 to 6 servings.    The following recipes (starting with "Perfect") are all variations or  elaborations of this basic pasta. The recipe is easily expanded: just keep  the proportion of one extra-large egg to one cup of flour. A one-egg batch  will serve two adults as a main course or three as a first course or side  dish. If you are serving ardent pasta lovers or if you want leftovers, add  an extra egg and cup of flour to the batch. We are quite fond of leftover  pasta for breakfast.    2 cups unbleached flour 2 extra-large eggs    Mixing by hand:    Heap the flour and make a well in it. Break the eggs into the well and beat  them together with a fork, then stir the eggs into the flour from the  bottom of the well until the dough in the center is smooth and shiny. With  your hands, incorporate the flour from the outside into the center,  kneading gently until the mass of dough is consistent but still soft.    Continue to knead until the dough is smooth and resilient. You may need to  add more flour if the dough is sticky or very pliable, or you may not  incorporate all of the flour. Divide the dough into two portions and cover  it with plastic wrap or an overturned bowl. Let it rest for at least 30  minutes before putting it through a pasta machine.    Mixing with a food processor:    Place the flour in the work bowl fitted with the steel blade and pulse. Add  the eggs and process 30 seconds. The dough should just turn over itself at  the top of the bowl. Test by stopping the machine and pinching a bit of the  dough together. It should cohere readily. If it doesnt, add water, a  teaspoonful at a time, and process; add only as much water as necessary.  Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead for a few minutes.    Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling.    Rolling and cutting:    Begin rolling one portion of the dough through the machine at the widest  setting of the rollers (usually "1"). Fold it and run it through the widest  setting another time or two. Always put an open side into the machine when  adding folded dough. If the dough feels wet or sticky, dust it lightly with  flour before running it through the machine.    Advance the rullers a notch and put the dough through the machine with-out  folding. Continue rolling the dough once through each setting without  folding. The final setting of pasta machines varies; the ideal thickness  for cannelloni, fettuccine, or lasagna is about 1/16 inch (the last setting  on some machines, the next to the last on others). The pasta will be  difficult to handle if it is rolled too thin.    When the pasta is the desired thickness, trim the odd-shaped pieces from  the ends, reserving them for another use (in soup, for example). Cut the  long sheet of dough into lengtlls that will be easy to work with; 12 inches  is about right for many shapes of noodles. Set the pieces of cut pasta on a  smooth, lightly floured surface so that they do not touch. The pasta is  ready to cut into desired shapes, either by rolling it through the cutters  on the machine or by hand. Fettuccine and linguine are easiest to eat if  they are cut finally into 6-inch lengths. Roll and cut the remaining  portion of dough.
