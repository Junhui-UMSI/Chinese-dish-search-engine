Prepare the pie shell.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.  In a small saucepan,  melt the butter. Set aside to cool. In a medium sized bowl, beat the eggs  with an electric mixer. Add the sugars and flour, continuing to beat until  the mixture is light and creamy. Beat in the cooled butter until thoroughly  incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chops and walnuts with a mixing spoon.  Pour the filling into the pie shell. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Cool before serving.                         --The Streamliner Diner Cookbook
