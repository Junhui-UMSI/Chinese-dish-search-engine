Combine molasses and baking soda; set aside. Use mixer to cream  butter and sugar. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add reserved molasses mixture. Mix until combined. Combine flour and salt.  Add alternately with milk until combined and smooth. Transfer to prepared  pan. Bake until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 50  minutes. Set pan on cooling rack; let cool 15 minutes. Gently invert pan  and remove cake. Let rest at least 45 minutes before serving. Serve warm.  Can be made a day ahead and kept at room temperature, well-covered, or  frozen up to 3 months, wrapped airtight. To serve, reheat cake (thaw in  wrapping first, if frozen), wrapped in foil in 350F oven until warmed  through, about 15 minutes (or alternately, in microwave oven on medium  power until just warmed through, not hot). Sift confectioners sugar over  cake.
