Tequila Beef Steaks
New York strip steaks, Pepper, Salt, Tequila, olive oil, Lemon peel, Garlic, 
With a damp paper towel, wipe steaks; put meat in a 1-gallon plastic food  bag. Add tequila, oil, pepper, lemon peel, and garlic; seal bag, and turn  to mix seasonings. Set bag in a bowl; chill at least 1 hour or up to 1 day;  turn bag over occasionally. Drain steaks and place on a grill 4 to 6 inches  above a solid bed of hot coals (you can hold your hand at grill level only  2 to 3 seconds, or set gas barbeque at this heat). Turn steaks to brown  evenly; for medium-rare (cut to test), cook 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to  plates; season to taste with salt.
