Cut each bacon slice crosswise in half, wrap each  half around a scallop. Secure with toothpick. Sprinkle lightly with salt  and seasoned pepper. Broil 8-10 mins, turning frequently so bacon will  brown evenly, until scallops turn opaque through. Remove toothpicks.  Arrange on platter, garnish with lemon wedges. 205 cals per serving.
