Preheat a charcoal grill to high or an oven broiler to 500 degrees. If  wooden skewers are used, soak them in cold water until ready to use.      Cut the beef into 1 inch cubes. There should be 24 cubes.      Peel and cut the onions into 24  1 inch cubes. Reserve the remaining  onion for another use. Set the cubes aside until ready to cook.      Cut away and discard the pepper cores and seeds. Cut the peppers into  24 equal-size pieces and set aside until ready to cook.      Combine the meat and remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl.
