CRUST: Sift flour, sugar, salt and cinnamon into bowl. Cut butter into dry  ingredients with pastry cutter or 2 knives. Add just enough apple cider to  hold dough together. Form dough into a ball. Flatten slightly and roll out  on lightly floured surface. Fit pastry carefully into a 9 or 10-inch pie  pan. Trim crust 1/2-inch beyond edge of pan and roll edge under. Crimp  edges.    FILLING: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Pare and thinly slice apples. Mix  egg, sour cream, sugar, salt, vanilla and flour; add to apples and toss  until lightly coated. Spoon apples into pastry shell. Bake 10 minutes, then  reduce heat to 350 degrees F and continue baking until apples are tender,  about 40 to 45 minutes.    TOPPING: Mix together sugars, cinnamon, flour and salt. Add nuts and melted  butter and blend thoroughly. When pie has been in the oven for about 35  minutes, spread topping over it and continue baking until golden, about 10  or 15 minutes.
