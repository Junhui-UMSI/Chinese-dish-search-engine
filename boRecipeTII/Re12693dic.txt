**bulgur cracked wheat may be substituted.    Bring 2 cups water to a boil in the saucepan and slowly pour in the  quadrotriticale (or bulgur) so that the water keeps on boiling. Reduce the  heat and simmer with the lid on for about 10 minutes, or until the water is  all absorbed. Then take off the lid and cook for a few minutes more,  stirring constantly, to dry it out a bit. Spread it on the sides and bottom  of a large salad bowl so it can cool more quickly and put it in the  refrigerator to chill it.    Meanwhile peel and dice the cucumber, discarding the seeded center part  if it is not firm. Clean and slice the green onions into 1/8" pieces,  including abut 3" of the green tops. Cut the core out of the tomatoes and  cut them into 1/2" chunks. Wash and chop the parsley. Chop the mint or the  pepper, if you are using one of them.    When the wheat is cool, break it up with a fork until it is loose and  there are no chunks more than 1/2" in size. Add the vegetables to it and  mix, then add the salt and pepper, lemon juice (or vinegar), and the olive  oil. Mix again thoroughly.    Note: It is traditional to add mint or green pepper to only a part of the  salad when the host is not sure of all his guests preferences.
