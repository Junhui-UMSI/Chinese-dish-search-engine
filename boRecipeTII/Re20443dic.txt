Vegan Salad Dressing with Tofu
Water, garlic, Mori-Nu Lite, Rice vinegar, Nutritional yeast, Tamari, Salt, 
Throw the first 5 ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend  until smooth. The dressing will be about mayonnaise consistency. Gradually  add water until the desired creamy consistency is reached. Add salt, tamari  or more vinegar to taste and blend in. This keeps about 3 days in an  airtight container in the fridge.    To roast garlic, peel off loose skin layers until the individual cloves  show. Dont peel the cloves. Brush them with a little veg. oil (dont  worry, it wont soak in) and put in a ceramic dish. I do 4 heads at a time  in an 8x8 cake pan. Bake at 400F for 15-20 min. until the skin chars a  little. Peel the cloves and mash them with a fork to use as a breadspread  or in the salad dressing above.    Variations: add 4 halves of reconstituted sundried tomatoes, diced, or 1  tbs baked eggplant, or your favorite fresh or dried herbs to taste, or sub.  balsamic vinegar for rice.
