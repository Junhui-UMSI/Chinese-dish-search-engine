Lazy Mamas Hearty Pancakes
Dry oatmeal, Egg replacer, Banana; (you can saute the, Water; (may need more), 
I make these all the time as a hearty breakfast for myself and my  14-month-old. He cant eat them fast enough!    Whiz banana in blender to paste consistency, then add remaining ingredients  and blend well. You may need more water if it is too thick. Pour as with  regular pancakes. Batter tends to thicken as it sits, so you may need even  more water to thin it if you have to step away.    Posted to fatfree digest by Brent Van Ryn <vanrynbg@erols.com> on Aug 11,  1998,
