Pickled Shalots
White vinegar, TABASCO pepper sauce, Water, Sugar, Crubmled dried rosemary, Slat, Small shallots or pearl, 
Heres a couple from Tabasco Cookbook that I have used and are good.    Drop the shallots into a large pot of boiling water and cook for 1 minute.  Drain and rinse with cold water. Cut off the roots, slip off skins and set  aside In a large saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients and simmer for  3 minutes. Add the shallots and simmer for 15 minutes, until tender-crisp.  Cool them slightly, then cover and refrigerate. Allow the shallots to stand  for 2 to 3 days to blend flavors. They may be kept refrigerated in sealed  containers for several weeks. Serve them at room temperature.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Lillian Mount <BirdsEtc@AOL.COM> on Feb 16, 1998
