Pennsylvania Dutch Shoofly Pie
FILLING, Water, flaky pie dough, Unsalted butter, Dark corn syrup, All purpose bleached flour, Light brown sugar, Baking soda, Molasses, 
Prepare and chill the dough.    For the filling, bring the water to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan and remove  from heat. Stir in molasses and corn syrup. Stir in baking soda/water  mixture (the mixture will foam up in the pan). Set aside to cool. Combine  flour and sugar in a mixing bowl and rub in butter until the mixture forms  1/4 to 1/2-inch crumbs. Set aside.    Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the lowest level. For the  bottom crust, lightly flour the work surface and the dough and roll it to a  12-inch disk. Fold the dough in half and place it in the pan; unfold the  dough and press it firmly into the pan. Trim away all but 1/2-inch excess  dough at the edge of the pan. Fold excess dough under and flute edge.    Pour cooled molasses mixture into crust and evenly scatter the crumbs over  it.    Bake the pie for 15 minutes on the bottom rack of the oven. Lower the  temperature to 350 degrees and move the pie to the middle rack. (Place a  jelly roll pan lined with aluminum foil on the rack below and under the pie  to catch drips if the filling begins to boil over). Bake the pie about 20  to 30 minutes longer, until the crust and crumb topping are a deep golden.
