Pepper Vinegar
Pepper Vinegar, 
Find an empty Worcestershire bottle, or the like, remove the inner cap and  wash well. Wearing gloves, drop as many peppers as you can into the bottle.  Fill with warm cider vinegar, replace "sprinkler cap" and lid and allow to  ripen. Use over mustard greens, red beans, salads, etc. Add vinegar as it  gets used up. Keeps its zest for about a year, which works out well,  because by that time you have another crop. A great gift item!! Some people  use sherry instead of vinegar. Use them fresh to stuff pot roast along with  the garlic. Look before you bite!!    Recipe By     : DDMmom    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
