Theyre  much better than the store-bought kind.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In medium bowl with mixer at low speed, beat  all ingredients until blended, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber  spatula. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, onto ungreased  cookie sheets. Bake cookies 10 to 12 minutes until edges of cookies are  browned. With pancake turner, remove cookies to wire racks to cool. Store  cookies in tightly covered container to use up within 1 week. --makes 4  dozen    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
