Unusual Green Pepper Jelly
Crushed red pepper, Salt, Liquid fruit pectin, Sugar, Vinegar, Green peppers, 
Seed peppers, and chop coarsely.  Place half of chopped peppers and 3/4  cup vinegar in container of electric blender; process on high speed until  smooth. Repeat with remaining chopped peppers and vinegar.    Combine pureed peppers, red pepper, sugar, and salt in a large Dutch  oven; bring to a boil, and add pectin.  Cook, stirring often, for 30  minutes or until mixture sheets from a metal spoon. Quickly pour jelly into  sterilized jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Cover at once with a 1/8-inch  layer of paraffin.  Cover with metal lids, and screw metal bands tight.    Serve with cream cheese on crackers as an appetizer. From Southern  Living, June, 1982.
