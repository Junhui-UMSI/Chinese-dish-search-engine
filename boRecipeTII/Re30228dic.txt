They are light rather like a sponge cake in consistency.     This makes two, and they freeze well.     NOTE: the amount of milk is dependent on the ripeness of the bananas. The  mushier they are the less or no milk.>     Cream the butter and sugar well. Add the eggs one at a time and cream  well. Add mashed banana. Add flour, salt and baking powder to the mixture  and if necessary the milk, to keep the mixture "slack" rather than like a  thick batter. Add the vanilla. Put into the tins, loaf or cake.     Bake in a moderate oven for 45 mins to 1 hour. Moderate is about 180  degrees Celcius, 250 Farheinheit, and about Gas Mark 5.     Pierce with a knife to ensure its cooked. if the knife is clean then its  done.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
