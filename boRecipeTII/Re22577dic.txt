Place ingredients in the bread machine in the order listed.  Use the dough    setting. Add the apricots 5 minutes before the end of the kneading phase or  work into the dough before shaping. If you dont have a dough setting stop  the    machine after the rises.    Prepare the baking sheets or use nonstick sheets. Remove dough from the  machine, punch it down, and roll it out into a rectangle about 14 x 18.  Divide into equal pieces and shape into bagel form or use a cutter. Place  the bagels on the sheets and let them rise again.  I put them in the oven  to provide a draft free location.    This rise can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 4 hours depending on what else  is going on in your life.    Fill a 4 to 6 qt soup pot with water 3 to 4 " deep.  You can add 2 T of  malt syrup, honey, sugar or non-diastatic malt powder. Get the water to  boiling.    Preheat the oven to 400.    Drop the bagels one at a time into the boiling water.  Boil only 3 or 4 at  a time so they dont crowd. Simmer each side for a minute and return to the    baking sheet.    Add glazes or toppings as desired.    Bake just below the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven.  The book calls  for 20 to 25 minutes. I usually start at 15 minutes for the 1st sheet and  less for the second.    These are best eaten while they are still warm.  They can be frozen - you  may want to slice them first so you can defost them in the toaster.    Serving Ideas : for peach bagels sub dried peaches for the apricots    NOTES : I use orange oil instead of the orange extract. These are really  excellent.
