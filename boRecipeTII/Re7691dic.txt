Terrys notes: Tsakistes are cracked green olives that are marinated in  herbs and brine. They can be purchased in Greek specialty shops. Variation:  Omit slivered almonds and tsakistes olives. Slice 12 green olives stuffed  with almonds and add with 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice to the cooked  tenderloin. Heat to blend flavors.

I also omitted the mushrooms because I dont like  them. I added more almonds than called for and I chopped the onions instead  of slicing. It was yummy!
