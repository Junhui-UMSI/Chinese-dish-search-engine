Small white beans, soaked baking soda    Bring beans to boil.  Boil for 2 minutes.  Turn off heat.  Add 2 tsp baking  soda to water and allow to soak 10-12 hours.  Drain water off and rinse a  few times.  Bring beans to a boil and boil another 2 minutes. Drain and  rinse again. Place beans in large bowl. Add chopped onions and mix well.  Mix all ingredients for sauce together and bring to boil. Meanwhile, place  once piece of salt pork on bottom of pint jar. Fill with bean/onion mixture  and place another piece of salt pork on top. Arrange all your jars of beans  on counter and then fill with hot sauce. Seal with two piece lids and  arrange in pressure canner. Process at 11 pounds pressure for 70 minutes.  Allow canner to cool on its own. When pressure is completely down, remove  canner lid. Place jars on towel and adjust lids. Allow to cool on their  own, adjust lids again.  Label and store in cool, dark storage.    **My notes**  This is the most simplest method for making beans that I have  ever done.  No baking with the oven going all day long, and no having to  sand blast the baked black parts off of the bean crock. 8-}    Origin: Adapted from a basic recipe in Putting Food by.
