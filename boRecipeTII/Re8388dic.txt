* Bake potatoes at 400F until soft, about 45 minutes. Cool, and slice in  half, lengthwise. Scoop out most of the insides and reserve for mashing  later.    ** You can use any veggies or cooked meat of your choice.    Spray the potato halves lightly with cooking oil spray and sprinkle on  seasoning(s) of choice. Place under broiler until brown and crisp. (If you  like your skins very crisp, you can broil the bottom of the skins first.)    Note that these broiled skins can be wrapped in foil and refrigerated for  several days.    Lightly beat the Egg Beaters with the skim milk and salt and pepper. Saute  the red bell peppers, Southwest seasonings, garlic, and scallions under  tender. (I use water to loosen the veggies when they begin to stick, but  you may use any sauteing medium of your choice.) Remove the veggies from  the skillet, and add the eggs. Gently scrap the bottom of the pan to move  the edges of the eggs to the center. When almost cooked, add the sauteed  veggies. Cover and stir occasionally until the eggs are cooked.    Spoon a little salsa into the cavities of the potato skins. Fill the skins  with the cooked eggs. Top with some pieces of sliced nf cheese. Place under  broiler until melted. Serve with salsa and nonfat yogurt or sour cream.
