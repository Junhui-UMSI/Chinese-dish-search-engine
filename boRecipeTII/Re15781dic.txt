Abm Spelt Bread
Water, Bread flour, Gluten, Spelt flour, Lecithin granules, Rolled oats, Dry milk, Red Star Active Dry yeast, Salt, Barley malt, 
I made this in a 1-lb. Panny. For larger loaves, tell Meal Master to change  the servings to 3.    Spelt is said to have enough gluten to substitute 1/1 for bread flour, but  I thought Id play it safe the first time and mix it with bread flour. Its  also cheaper that way. Spelt flour, btw, has 21 grams of protein per cup as  opposed to 16 grams per cup of bread flour.    Its a nice down-to-earth bread--nothing flashy. Light brown with a chewy  crust. It slices easily with my new Slice n Easy. Good for sandwiches.    Cheers, Margie, NY  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #828 by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on  Oct 06, 1997
