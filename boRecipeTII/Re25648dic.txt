Avocados with Strawberry Salsa and Crispy Tortilla Stri Pt 2
See part 1, 
(about 1/8 inch thick) and transfer to a baking sheet. Using a 9-inch plate  as a guide, trim dough to a 9-inch round. Prick round all over with a fork  and chill 30 minutes. Bake round in middle of oven until golden, about 30  minutes, and cool completely on baking sheet on a rack.    Just before serving, assemble tart. Have ready a flat serving plate at  least 10 inches in diameter with a slight lip. Run a thin knife around edge  of creme caramel and rotate pie plate back and forth to make sure creme  caramel is loosened. Slide crust on top of creme caramel and invert serving  plate on top of crust. Invert tart onto serving plate (caramel will run to  edges of plate) and garnish with strawberries.
