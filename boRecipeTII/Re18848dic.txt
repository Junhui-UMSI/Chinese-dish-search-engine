Andouille Sausage Making
Ground mace, Pepper, Garlic, Minced thyme, Ground cloves, Onions, Parsley, Pork, Bay Leaves, Salt (not iodized), Chili pepper, Ground allspice, Minced marjoram, Cayenne pepper, Tripe or chitterlings, 
Pork should be approx 2 lbs fat and 2 lbs lean [usually Boston butt] The  tripe is the inner lining of pork stomach and chitterlings (largest  intestine) may be used instead. You can use an extra pound of pork instead  of the tripe/chitterlings.    Chop, do not grind the meat.  Mix with seasonings. Stuff into casings. Age  at least overnight and then smoke several hours using hickory, hackberry or  ash. (Do not use pine.) Throw anything sweet, such as cane sugar or syrup,  raw sugar, molassess, sugar cane or brown sugar on the wood before  lighting. [-=PAM=-]    Paul A.
