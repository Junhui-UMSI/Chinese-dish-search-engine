DESCRIPTION:  A rich, sour-cream dough is laden with poppyseeds and braided  into 5-inch sticks.    Combine flour, poppy seed and baking soda; set aside. Beat together butter,  sugar and salt until combined. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each  addition. Beat in sour cream and vanilla. Add flour in 1-cup increments,  blending after each addition. Gather dough into a ball and wrap in plastic;  refrigerate one hour. Preheat oven to 375. Divide dough in half;  refrigerate one half. On well-floured surface, roll out half of dough into  a 15" by 5" rectangle, 1/4 inch thick. Using a floured knife, cut dough  into 60 5- x 1/4-inch strips; dip knife in flour often to facilitate  cutting. Lay three 5-inch strips side by side on floured surface. Braid  strips (working from middle toward the ends will make a more uniform  braid), pinch ends together. Brush completed braids with egg white glaze;  sprinkle lightly with poppyseed. Arrange braids, 1" apart, on buttered  baking sheets. Repeat with second half of dough. Bake 13-16 minutes, or  until golden and crisp. Cool on racks. Store airtight at room temp 5 days,  freeze for three months. From "The Joy of Cookies," formatted by Theresa  Grant, HWWK11b.
