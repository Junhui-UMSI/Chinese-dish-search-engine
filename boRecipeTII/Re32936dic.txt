Sweet Squash Soup
Sliced onion, Chopped carrot, Water, Minced fresh ginger, Peeled & chopped apple, Butternut or buttercup, 
Put the whole squash in a microwave oven and cook on high power for 8  minutes. Peel the squash and cut into cubes. (If you dont have a  microwave oven, this step may be omitted. This brief cooking time simply  makes the squash easier to peel and cut up.)    Place all of the ingredients in a large soup pot and simmer over  medium-low heat for 45 minutes. Place the soup in a blender or food  processor, in batches, and blend until smooth and creamy.    Inputted by Sue Smith. From _The New McDougall Cookbook_ (1993).
