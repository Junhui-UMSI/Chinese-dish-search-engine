Cut off tops of the pumpkins and clean out the seeds and strings. Scoop out  part of the pulp to form a clean cavity. In a 4 quart heavy saucepan or  stockpot, melt 1/3 cup butter over medium heat and saute onion until  translucent, about 3 minutes.    Add the flour and stir to form a paste. Cook and stir over low heat for 2  minutes. Gradually whisk the warm milk or half-and-half into flour mixture.  Add the bay leaf. Bring to a simmer and cook gently for 15 minutes. Add the  pumpkin puree and simmer an additional 15 minutes over low heat.    Strain through doubled cheesecloth or pass through a food mill. Season with  salt and pepper to taste. In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2  tablespoons butter and saute the apple for 2 minutes.    Add the thyme and nutmeg and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer or until the apple  is tender by not mushy.    Spoon a portion of apple into each carved pumpkin bowl. Add the sherry, if  using, to the hot soup and pour into the pumpkin bowls on top of the  apples.    Top with a dollop of whipped cream and serve.
