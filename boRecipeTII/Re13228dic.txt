Worlds Greatest Playdough
Flour, Water, Salt, Vegetable oil, Alum, Food coloring, 
Mix together flour, salt, and alum. Boil together water, oil, and food  coloring. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and mix well. Will be a  little tacky at first. Add more flour, if necessary. Will set up more as it  cools.    busted by sooz    Recipe by: Key Gourmet    Posted to recipelu-digest by sooz <kirkland@gj.net> on Mar 19, 1998
