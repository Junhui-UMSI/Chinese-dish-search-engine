Twice-Baked Potatoes #1
cheese, Baking potatoes, butter, Sour cream, Onion, salt and pepper, 
Wash potatoes, but do not scrub too hard. Make several pricks in each  potato with a fork & bake on rack at 350 degrees until done. (Do not wrap  in foil, as shells will be too soft.) When done, slice potatoes in half  lengthwise. Scoop out potato into large mixing bowl, leaving shells intact.  Saute onion in butter until soft. Beat potato until all lumps are out. Add  other ingredients & mix well. If too stiff, add a little milk. Spoon  mixture back into shells & top with more grated cheese. Bake until bubbly &  cheese is melted. May be made ahead, refrigerated & heated in oven.    MRS. STEVE TONEY    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.
