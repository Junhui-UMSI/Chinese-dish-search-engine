Ron asked for winter squash recipes. This is a favorite at my house, I make  it several times each winter. Substitute any variety of hard winter squash.  It is from Linday Wagners cookbook, The Higher Road to Health.    * Or, bring to a boil for 1 minute, turn off heat and let soak for 1 hour.  Drain and rinse peas, cover with water and simmer for 20 minutes.    ** butternut, buttercup, banana, acorn, pumpkin, etc    Bring to a simmer, cook for 30 - 45 minutes, or until all is tender. Then  add Corn, cut from 4 cobs fresh or 2 cups frozens sweet corn. Heat through.  This is good to cook ahead and serve the next day. Or for the crockpot,  soak the peas overnight, then put it all in the crock pot in the morning,  (hold off on the salt and corn). Cook on low all day, add corn, heat and  serve. You can serve this in bowls by itself with corn bread or crusty  french bread or serve it over grains, such as bulgar or rice.
