Line nori sheets with half of the spinach. Place a strip of ahi  crosswise on leaves, top with remaining spinach. Roll and seal with water.  Combine the 1 cup flour, eggs, and water to make a batter. Dredge rolls in  flour, batter, and then in panko. Heat oil to 375 degree F; fry rolls until  evenly browned. Slice each roll into 6 pieces. Place 2 tablespoons  Wasabi-Ginger Butter Sauce on 6 individual plates; arrange 4 pieces ahi on  each. Makes 6 servings.
