Wok-Fried Sweet and Sour Pork
Water, Peanut oil, Pork, Egg yolk, Glutinous rice, Cornstarch, Garlic, Pineapple chunks in juice, Green peppers, All-purpose flour, 
~-- Sauce: --- 3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon soy sauce  1      tablespoon    catsup 4 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons wine vinegar  1      dash          hot pepper sauce    SAUCE: Blend the water and cornstarch until smooth. Stir in the catsup, soy  sauce, sugar, vinegar and, if desired, a few drops of hot pepper seasoning.  Set aside.    PORK: Beat egg yolk with the water. Blend in 1 tablespoon flour and 1  tablespoon cornstarch until smooth. Add the cubed pork and mix to coat  well. Drain off the excess mixture from the pork cubes. Place the wok over  heat and add oil to 1-1/2 inch depth. Heat to 340 degrees. Use a  thermometer if you can; it is more reliable than a wok with a temperature  gauge. Add the drained meat and cook until golden brown, about 10-13  minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep meat warm. Pour off all the  oil and wipe wok with a paper towel. Return 2 tablespoons of the oil to  wok. Place over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add the garlic and green  peppers. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes, or until garlic is light brown. Add  the pineapple, the sauce you prepared ahead of time and the pork. Stir this  mixture until it boils and thickens (about 1-1/2 minutes). Serve over  steamy hot rice.
