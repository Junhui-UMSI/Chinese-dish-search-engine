Zen Barbecued Chicken
Bottle vinegar, Bottle open pit barbecue, (large) finely chopped onion, Box (small)dark brown sugar, Chicken thighs; enough for, Hoisin sauce, Jar orange marmelade, Hot sauce to taste, 
No one asked, but...  Some years ago I learned the secrets of chicken  barbecue from a Zen Chicken Master. Here they are, revealed for the first  time:    1. The chicken. Dont even bother to try barbecuing chicken breasts.  They  end up dry and tasteless. Use mainly thighs; theyre tastier and have  enough fat to be self-basting.    2. The sauce. Start by bringing to a boil a bottle of vinegar with a large  finely chopped onion. Simmer until the onion is very soft.  Add a small box  dark brown sugar (whats that- a pound?) and cook until dissolved and  smooth. To this add a bottle of Open Pit barbecue sauce. Finally, add the  Secret Ingredients: 1/2 cp Hoisin Sauce, 1 jar orange marmelade, Hot sauce  to taste.    3. The cooking: Dont add the sauce until the chicken is almost done. Brush  and turn a couple of times. The finished product should be a sticky mess.  (NOTE: Im guessing at the amount of chicken this will take!--Glen.)
