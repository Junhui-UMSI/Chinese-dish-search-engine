Pumpkin Ice Cream Squares
pumpkin, canned, Sugar, pecans, vanilla ice, pecans, Ginger snaps, salt and ginger and cinnamon, 
Leave out ice cream to soften to mixable consistancy. In a large bowl,  blend the ice cream, pumpkin, sugar, salt, spices and chopped pecans. Cover  the bottom of an ungreased sheet cake or lasagna pan (I prefer to use  glass) with a layer of ginger snaps. If desired, you can also place a row  of gingersnaps along the sides, standing on their side. Pour half the ice  cream mixture on top. Make another layer of ginger snaps on top of the ice  cream misture, and again along the sides if desired. Pour the remaining ice  cream mix on top. Garnish with whole pecans and/or ginger snap crumbs.  Re-freeze. Leave out 15 min or so before serving to make cutting and  removing from the pan easier. Cut into squares and serve. May be served  with a dollop of whipped cream.    Notes: I use a bit less sugar and a lot more spice than the recipe actually  calls for. You can really judge by taste as you mix -since this isnt baked  or cooked, the spices will taste the same when served as they do while you  mix them in. If using a prepared pumpkin pie filling, rather than plain  pumpkin, I dont add any more sugar, but do add a bit more spice.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Kim Malo <kmalo19@IDT.NET> on Nov 18, 1997
