Stir the cornmeal gradually into the rapidly boiling  water.  When the mixture is smooth, add butter, salt and stir in the milk.  Remove from heat and stir in the egg yolks.  Allow the mixture to cool to  warm (90-100 degrees).  Meanwhile, beat the egg whites to hold a peak. Fold  into the mixture.  Pour batter into the baking dish (one 1-quart baking  dish, greased or buttered).  It should come to no more than 3/4 way up the  sides.  Level with rubber spatula.  Bake in the oven until it is puffed and  nicely browned.  A knife blade slipped into the bread will come out clean  when it is done. Remove bread from the oven. Serve immediately, and with a  spoon.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
