Sweet Pickled Peaches
Stick cinnamon, Cloves, Brown sugar, Peaches, Peck, Vinegar, 
Boil sugar, vinegar, and cinnamon for 20 minutes.  Dip peaches quickly in  hot water, then rub off the fur (their words, not mine) with a towel. Stick  each peach with 4 cloves.  Put into syrup and cook until soft, using one  half of peaches at a time.  (Unfortunately, the recipe doesnt tell how to  store them). From a cook book dated 1896 from the Boston Cooking School.
