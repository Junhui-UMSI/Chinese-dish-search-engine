Tuna with Madeira, Orange, and Soy
Orange juice, Cream, Butter, Medallions of yellowfin, Flour, Madeira, Soy sauce, Salad oil, 
Dust tuna medallions with flour and shake off excess. Heat oil over medium  flame in a saute pan large enough to hold the medallions. Fry for 2 minutes  on each side, until browned.  Remove to a holding pan and keep warm in the  oven. Pour off and wipe out any excess oil from the pan and return to the  heat. Combine all remaining ingredients except the butter and boil to  reduce by half. Remove sauce from heat and swirl in the butter until just  melted and blended in the sauce. Place tuna medallions on dinner plates and  pour sauce over them. Serves 2.    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS  1-201-822-3627  Posted by FAYLEN    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
