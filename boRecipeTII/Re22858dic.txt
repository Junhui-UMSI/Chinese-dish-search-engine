Combine apricots, sugar, & jalapeno/pepper/vinegar mixture in large  saucepan. Bring to a boil. Boil rapidly, 5 minutes. Remove from heat; skim  off any foam that forms.    Allow mixture to cool for 2 minutes. Then mix in pectin (and food coloring  if youre going to use it).    Pour into sterilized jars, seal, and cool. (I processed in a boiling water  bath for 10 minutes.) Yield: 3 pints (I got 7 half pint containers.)    From "Chile Pepper: The Magazine of Spicy Foods" May/June 1990.  Vol. IV,  No. 3, pp. 30-31. In "Fiery Fruits" article by Nancy Gerlach.    Gerlach also wrote: "This recipe calls for apricots but peaches,  nectarines, and pears work equally well. Any fresh green chile can also be  substituted, depending on your heat preference. Serranos will make it  hotter; roasted, peeled New Mexican chiles will tame it down."
