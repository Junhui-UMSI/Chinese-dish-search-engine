* You may substitute a firm, white-flesh fish such as swordfish, tofu or  pork for the chicken.    Combine cornstarch and water in a large mixing bowl until well blended. Add  the chicken, making sure it is well coated.    Heat the oil in a nonstick fry pan over low heat. Add the dried chiles and  cook until they puff up and are slightly brown (not black), about 10  seconds. Remove, drain on paper towels, and set aside.    Increase the heat to high and add the lemon grass, garlic, sugar, chili  paste, and fresh chili until fragrant, about 1 minute. (The sauce is  exquisite when the sugar is slightly caramelized.)    Add the chicken, and using chopsticks or a spatula, stir to separate. Cook  until chicken begins to turn opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce the heat if the  pan starts to burn.    Add the chicken stock, fish sauce, salt, onion and carrots and continue  cooking for another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the reserved chilies, garnish with  the cilantro and serve immediately with rice.    Notes: The technique of creating aromatics is particularly important in  this recipe. Once the pan is sizzling hot, add the seasonings. Stir often  to extract the flavors and to prevent burning. If the fire is too hot,  simply slide the pan to an empty burner to cool a bit. If the seasonings  burn, start over from scratch or the dish will taste bitter.
