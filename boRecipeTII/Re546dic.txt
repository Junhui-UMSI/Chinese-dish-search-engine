Preheat oil for frying.  In a sauce pan, melt the butter.  Add the apples  and saute for 2 minutes.  Stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg, 1/4 cup sugar, and  brown sugar.  Continue sauteing for 1 minute, stirring constantly to  dissolve the sugar.  Add the water and lemon juice. Bring the liquid up to  a boil.  Add cornstarch dissolved in 1 Tablespoon of water. Whisk the  vanilla and slurry into the liquid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook  for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the apples are soft. Remove from heat and  cool completely.    In a mixing bowl, sift the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder, together.  Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, working it to make a  thick dough.  Break the dough into 12 equal portions. On a lightly floured  surface, roll the dough pieces into thin rounds, about 5 inches in  diameter.  Put 1/4 cup of the mixture in the center of each round, fold  over and crimp the edges with a fork.  Fry the pies, two to three at a  time, in the hot oil, until golden brown. Remove from the oil and drain on  paper towels.  Powder the pies with the powdered sugar. May serve with  vanilla ice cream. ...
