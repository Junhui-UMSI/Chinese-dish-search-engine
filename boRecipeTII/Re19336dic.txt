Vegetable Supreme for 12
Cream of Mushroom Soup;, Grated sharp cheddar, Box; (6oz) Seasoned, Eggs, Mayonnaise, Butter, Onion, Fresh cauliflower, Fresh broccoli, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Cook vegetables separately in boiling salted water 5  minutes. Drain thoroughly. Distribute evenly in a lightly buttered  casserole. Beat eggs. Combine with mayonnaise, onion, mushroom soup, and  1/2 cup grated cheese. Pour evenly over vegetables. Sprinkle remaining  cheese over top and level evenly. Pour melted butter over top of casserole.  Distribute crushed croutons over melted butter.    Bake 40 minutes.    Should be prepared early in the day (or even the day ahead) so the flavours  blend and the topping mellows. Bake again just before serving to heat  through.
