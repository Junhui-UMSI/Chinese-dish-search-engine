Quick Pound Cake
Eggs, Basic Cake Mix, milk, Vanilla extract, 
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.    Beat eggs until foamy; add milk and vanilla and continue beating.    Add dry mixture to eggs, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each  addition.    Pour into a greased 9-inch loaf pan and bake for 1-1/2 hours.    Idea: For a fruit shortcake, pour batter into a greased 9-inch square pan  and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. When cook, cut cake into 2-inch  squares. Slice each square in half, fill with berries and juice, and  replace top half.  Cover with sweetened whipped cream.    Variation: For a chocolate pound cake, add 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa to the  batter before baking.    SOURCE: Cheaper & Better, by Nancy Birnes Typed for you by Nancy Coleman
