The pork has to be barbecued - that is, cooked long and slow over a real  wood fire, preferably hickory. Temp should be around 220 degrees, and it  takes at least 1-1/2 hours per pound, or until internal temp. reaches  150-160 degrees. Needless to say, this is difficult to accomplish in the  average backyard Weber kettle, although it can be done. It has to be served  on a CWB: Cheap White Bun. After that, the only question is "with or  without?" Sweet cole slaw on top, that is.
