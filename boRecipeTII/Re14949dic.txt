3 Pepper Salad
Yellow pepper, Cayenne pepper, Balsamic vinegar, Basil sprigs, olive oil, Green pepper, 
FROM MY GARDEN SHOW #5520    Roast peppers by placing whole pepper on a broiler sheet or a grill. Turn  frequently until all sides are blackened. Place peppers in a brown paper  bag or a bowl covered with plastic wrap. This will steam the pepper and  make the skin easy to remove. Remove skin. Slice and arrange in a colorful  display on a platter. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and garnish  with basil sprigs.
