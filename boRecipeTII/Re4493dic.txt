With  machine running slowly, add oil in a slow, steady stream until mixture is  the consistency of thick mayonnaise. This sauce can be sored in a jar in a  refrigerator for up to 3 months.  Good on soup, best on pasta and French  bread.    EAT-L Digest 28 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
