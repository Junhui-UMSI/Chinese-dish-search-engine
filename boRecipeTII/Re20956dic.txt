Recipe by: Eat More, Weigh Less Combine the flour, egg substitute, 1 cup  yogurt, baking powder, orange juice, and 2 tablespoons maple syrup into a  batter. If you like thinner pancakes, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of water at  this point. Let rest for 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, in a nonstick skillet, saute  the sliced apples with 1 tablespoon water until the slices are tender and  caramelized. Combine the remaining yogurt and maple syrup with the  cinnamon. Using a nonstick omelette pan, make thin crepes by pouring 3  tablespoons of the batter into the preheated pan and rolling it around to  uniformly cover the surface of the pan.      Cook over medium heat about 1  minute, flip with a spatula and cook the other side for about 10 seconds.  Continue until all the batter has been used. For each serving, roll each of  two crepes around 2 tablespoons of the apples.  Garnish with a dollop of  flavored yogurt and a mint leaf. 278 calories, 1.2 grams fat per 3 (4- to  5-inch) pancakes with filling.
