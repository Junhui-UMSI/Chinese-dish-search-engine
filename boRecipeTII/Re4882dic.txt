Pickled Chillies
Salt, garlic, rosemary, Extra white wine vinegar, Whole fresh chillies, bay, White wine vinegar, 
But speaking of chiles (?), here are a couple of recipes I found in a small  book called _The Goodness of Peppers_ by John Midgley/illustrated by Ian  Sidaway (Pavilion Books Unlimited, London/copyright John Midgley 1993/ISBN:  1-85793-058-4). Havent read it all the way through, but its a short read,  abt. 30+ recipes, and some background/history of chiles....or chillies.  Cant say it looks like a "must-have" book, but it was a gift. Sez it only  costs L4.99 (what? oh you Brits...<g>).    Inspect the chillies for damage, discarding any that are bruised, lacerated  or otherwise blemished. Snip off all but the base of their stems. Bring the  vinegar and the chillies to a boil in a pan. Add the remaining ingredients  except the vinegar and simmer for 6-8 minutes. With a clean spoon, transfer  them to a jar previously sterilized with freshly boiled water. Pour in the  pickling liquid with its herbs, top up with the additional vinegar to  cover, and allow to cool before sealing. The chillies will be ready within  a month.    This quanitity will fill a medium-sized jar with whole chillies, preserved  with herbs and garlic and up to 675ml/1 1/2 pints/3 cups of vinegar.  Increase the vinegar quantity and dilute it with a little water if you want  to preserve a larger quantity of chillies, or sweet red and yellow peppers,  which should first have their caps, seeds and pithy membranes removed.
