Lightly saute onions in a mixture of water and oil.    Add celery and tomatoes, but only saute very little to soften and stop.  (the celery, if not over-cooked, gives a nice "crunch" to the loaf)    Combine all the ingredients and mix well, add bread crumbs and tomato juice  to make stiff.  Add water if the mixture seems too dry. Place in lightly  oiled loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.    Serve with favourite veggy ``gravy (optional.) After baking, cover with  towel to keep moist, or if you like it dry, dont cover.    Serve with Parsley "Gravy" Entered Separately    From: Jay Stevens                     Date: 10-11-93
