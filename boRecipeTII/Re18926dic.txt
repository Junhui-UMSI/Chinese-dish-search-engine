To prepare filling, in a medium saucepan, mix together berries, sugar,  liqueur, and lemon peel.    2.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until berries are soft  and sugar has dissolved, 5 to 8 min. (Do not overcook.) Let cool.    3.  Using a serrated knife, trim cake of any browned edges.  Cut cake into  1/2 inch slices; cut slices into triangles.    4.  Tightly line the bottom and sides of a 1 1/2 to 2 quart bowl or souffle  dish with three-quarters of the cake.  If necessary, fill any gaps with  small pieces of cake.    5.  Spoon filling into the cake-lined bowl.  Top with remaining cake  triangles, covering berries completely.    6.  Place a plate, just slightly smaller than the bowls diameter, on top  of pudding. Weigh down saucer with a 4 or 5 pound can. Chill for 8 hours or  overnight.    7.  Remove plate and can.  Carefully unmold pudding onto a serving plate.    8.  To prepare topping, beat cream at medium speed until soft peaks form.  Beat in confectioners sugar.    9.  Spoon cream mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip;  pipe small mounds of cream mixture on top of pudding. Garnish with fresh  berries and sprigs of fresh mint. NOTES  : Sinfully delicious, this puding just gets better as it sits (which is  never very long).  You can substitue frozen berries for fresh ones.
