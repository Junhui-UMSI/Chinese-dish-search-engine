Cut beans, crosswise, into 1/4 inch pieces. Boil with salt and turmeric  until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.    Heat oil in a small saucepan or skillet. When oil is hot, lower heat and  add chana dal, urad dal, mustard seeds, cumin, chili peppers and, if using,  curry leaves. Stir, cooking until dal turns golden and mustard seeds pop.  Remove from heat, add coconut, stir for a minute and mix into green beans.  Serve warm.    Courtesy, Sue Sista of "Sues India Cuisine", San Jose and Mountain View.
