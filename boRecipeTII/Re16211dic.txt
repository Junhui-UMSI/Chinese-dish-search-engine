I think someone a while ago requested medieval recipes. These come from  _The British Museum Cookbook_ by Michelle Berriedale-Johnson (1987, British  Museum Publications Ltd.). Its a great cookbook with recipes from the  civilizations from the museums collections. I personally havent tried  these recipes, but they sound interesting. I apologize in advance for any  typos!    Ms. Berriedale Johnson explains that wastels were good quality loaves  served to the gentry at a late medieval feast.    Put halved rolls in moderately hot oven for approx. 10 minutes or till they  are lightly browned and crips    Melt the butter in a pan and cook the mushrooms for a couple of minutes.  Add the spinich and the raisins and continue to cook gently for several  minutes, or till the butter has been almost absorbed by the veggies. Season  to taste with the slat, pepper, and spices. Beat the egg in a bowl, add to  the veggie mixture and cook it gently just long enough for the egg to  slightly bind to the other ingredients. Pile the filling into the halved  rolls and serve at once.    Posted to rec.food.recipes by "Jennifer A. Newbury" <jn1t+@andrew.cmu.edu>  on Sat, 25 Sep 1993.
