African Style Vegetables in Coconut Milk
Vegetable oil, Cloves, Onion, Garlic, Potato, Carrot, Green beans, Berbere, Hungarian paprika, Coconut milk, Salt & pepper, Cilantro, fresh, 
Heat vegetable oil with the whole cloves over low heat.   When hot,  add the onions & garlic & saute, stirring occasionally, for a few moments.  Add the carrots & potatoes & continue to saute for 5 minutes, stir to  prevent sticking. Add the green beans & saute for just a few more minutes.      Slowly stir in the coconut milk. Use only as much as you need to create a  thick sauce: the vegetables should not be swimming in milk. Carefully bring  to a boil, reduce heat & simmer until the vegetables are cooked, 15 to 20  minutes.   Stir occasionally otherwise the milk & vegetables will burn.  Garnish with cilantro.      Serve with an Ethiopian Lentil stew or with an Indian dal to mix cuisines,  & bread.    If you prefer the vegetables to be hotter, add more berbere.
