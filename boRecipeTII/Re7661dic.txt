Stilton Cheese, Chicken Broth, Whipping cream, Fresh Jalapeno Chilies, Pork Tenderloins, Canola oil, Port Wine, 
With a small sharp knife, trim surface fat and silvery membrane from pork.  In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, brown pork in oil,  turning to cook evenly.  Transfer meat to a 9- or 10-inch square pan. Bake  in a 400 degree oven until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part  registers 160 degrees, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, discard fat in frying  pan and add port and broth.  Boil over high heat until reduced to 3/4 cup,  about 3 minutes. Stir in cream and continue to boil until sauce forms large  shiny bubbles, about 5 minutes more.  Add cheese and chilies; stir until  cheese melts.  Remove from heat. Slice meat across the grain; fan equal  portions on each of 4 dinner plates.  Spoon sauce over meat.
