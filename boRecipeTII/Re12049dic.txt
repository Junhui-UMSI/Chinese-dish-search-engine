From The Jewish Star (Central NJ Jewish Newspaper)    Combine all ingredients in a one quart microwave-safe bowl and cook on high  for 2 minutes. Stir. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Pour mixture onto  a greased baking sheet to cool. Serve as an hors doeuvre or dessert.    Warning: when cooled, it sticks to whatever its on/in. Be prepared to do  the only type of prying appropriate for Rosh Hashana :-)    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #009    From: Sam Saal <saal@haven.ios.com>    Date: Sat, 31 Aug 1996 23:53:47 -0400 (EDT)
