Basic Barbecue Baste
Red chile and garlic sauce, Picapeppa sauce, Ketchup, Rice vinegar, Twist and Shout (see note), Honey, 
Mix the first 5 ingredients, microwave for 90 secs (until bubbling), and  add the honey. Brush on meat. Grill, and continue to baste until meat is  ready.    Note: My wife discovered, and I love,  a grocery-store bought Habanero hot  sauce by Mezzettas, called "Twist and Shout".  It has a very good Habanero  taste, and a nice little kick.  It sells for $1.50 per 8 ounce bottle. It  makes a great addition to barbecue sauces. David Wilkins A chile head stuck  in a state with a town named BLANDing.
