Crumble the tofu and drop it into a large kettle of boiling water. Bring  the water back to a boil and cook for 1 minute.     Drain the tofu through a colander lined with a clean dishtowel.     Run some cold water over the tofu to cool it off for easier handling.  Twist the towel and press the tofu to expel the excess water. Continue  pressing the tofu until it has a firm, ground-beef-like texture; then set  it aside.     Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion, garlic, thyme, basil,  celery seed, and sage. Saute until the onion is tender.     Add the pressed tofu and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5-10 minutes  more. Add the tamari, tomato paste, nutritional yeast and water. Mix well.     Use this mix in casseroles, spaghetti sauces, chili, pizza toppings, etc.  This freezes well and can be used in any recipe calling for ground beef.     From the files of DEEANNE
