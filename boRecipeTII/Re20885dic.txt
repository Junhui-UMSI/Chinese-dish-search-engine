I have seen several requests for apple muffins lately, so here is my  favorite recipe.  The multigrain oatmeal is sold in the US by Quaker and  can be found in the cereal aisle at the grocery store next to the Quaker  rolled oats. If you cant find it, you can probably substitute  quick-cooking oats.     In a mixing bowl, combine all of the dry ingredients (except granulated  sugar).  Add the chopped apple and stir to coat with the dry ingredients.  Add the remaining ingredients (except granulated sugar) and stir just until  moistened.     Spray 12 muffin tins with cooking spray (or use papers).  Spoon the batter  in to the tins, filling them full.  Sprinkle muffin tops with a little  granulated sugar.     Bake in a 400 degree oven for 18 to 20 minutes or until done.     Per muffin: 175 calories, 5 g total fat, 24 mg cholesterol, 120 mg solium,  29 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 4 g protein.
