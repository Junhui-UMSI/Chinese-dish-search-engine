Here is more recipes of Lebkuchen: from the Visions of Sugarplums    Beat eggs with sugar until thick and pale yellow. Add almonds, fruit, peel  and lemon rind. Sift flour with spices and baking powder and add gradually  to egg mixture, stirring well between additions. Add enough flour to make a  fairly stiff dough that is not sticky. Knead on a floured board until  smooth. Shape into finger-thick rolls; then cut in 1 inch slices. Arrange  on a buttered cookie sheet and let dry uncovered, at room temperature,  overnight. Bake in preheated 300 oven for about 20 minutes, or until pale  golden brown.    Makes about 3 dozen cookies    Variation: If you would like to prepare these cookies with bakers rice  wafers use 8 eggs to make a soft spreadable dough. Do not knead, but spread  onto wafers, let dry overnight and then bake. This softer mixture can also  be spread into a buttered 11" x 16" jelly roll pan, then dried and baked.  When still warm, cut into rectangles and cool thoroughly in pan before  serving.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #441 by aklatt@trxinc.com (Arlene Klatt)  on Dec 6, 1997
