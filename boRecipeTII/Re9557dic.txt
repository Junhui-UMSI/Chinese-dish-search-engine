Pumpkin Chutney Bread
Brown Sugar, Coarsely chopped pecans, Slivered dried apricots, Baking soda, Vegetable shortening, Bottle (9-ounce) Major, (16-ounce) solid pack, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Ground ginger, Salt, Eggs, beaten slightly, Ground cinnamon, Baking Powder, Grated nutmeg, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter and lightly flour a 9-by-5-inch  loaf pan.    Combine the flour, salt, baking soda and powder, cinnamon, ginger and  nutmeg in a bowl and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the shortening and  sugar together with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in the eggs and  pumpkin puree until well combined. With a wooden spoon, stir in the chutney  and then the flour mixture to make a moderately thick batter. Mix in the  pecans and apricots just until distributed evenly. Spoon the batter into  the prepared loaf pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of  the bread comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Let the bread cool in the pan  for 15 minutes and then invert it onto a rack, turn right side up and let  cool completely. Slice into 1/2 inch thick slices and accompany with  butter, if desired.
