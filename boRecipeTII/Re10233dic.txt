Quick and Easy Pizza Crust
Quick-rise yeast, olive oil, Warm water, Sugar, Cooking spray, Salt, Cornmeal, Bread flour, 
Combine first four ingredients in a large bowl; make a well in center of  mixture. Combine water and oil; add to flour mixture. Stir until mixture  forms a ball.    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and  elastic (about 10 minutes). Place the dough in a large bowl coated with  cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85  degrees), free from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Punch  dough down; divide in half. Cover and let dough rest 10 minutes.    Working with one portion at a time (cover remaining dough to keep from  drying), roll each portion into a 10-inch circle on a lightly floured  surface. Place dough on two baking sheets, each sheet sprinkled with one  tablespoon cornmeal.    To grill dough:    Prepare your grill. Place pizza round on grill rack coated with cooking  spray; grill 3 minutes or until puffy and golden. Turn crust over with  grill marked side up and top with your favorite toppings and cook with lid  closed until cheese is bubbly. (Ive tried this. Its easy and very  delicious!)    Yield: 2 (10-inch) pizza crusts.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by Jennifer F Cote <j.cote@JUNO.COM> on Dec 19,  1997
