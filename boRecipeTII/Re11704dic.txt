Raspberry-Cream Cheese Coffee Cake (1970)
powdered sugar, Vanilla, biscuit mix, milk, Raspberry preserves, cream cheese, Milk, almonds, 
I recently got a new cookbook (actually I got 4 new cookbooks!) and thought  that I would share a recipe from it with you. This is from the Better Home  and Gardens 75 years of All-Time Favorites.    In a medium mixing bowl cut cream cheese into biscuit mix until crumbly.  Stir in the 1/3 cup milk. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead  gently 8 to 10 strokes. On waxed paper roll dough to a 12X8-inch rectangle.  Turn onto a greased baking sheet; remove paper. Spread preserves down  center of dough. Make 2 & 1/2-inch-long cuts, at 1-inch intervals, from  edges of long sides toward the center. Starting at an end, alternately fold  opposite strips of dough, at an angle, across the filling. Slightly press  ends together in the center to seal. Bake in a 425 degree oven for 15 to 17  minutes or until golden brown. In a small mixing bowl combine powdered  sugar, vanilla, and enough of the 1 to 3 teaspoons milk to make it of  drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm coffee cake. If desired, sprinkle  with almonds.    Makes 12 servings.
