Marsala, WILSON  BWVB02B, Mascapone or cottage, Semi-sweet chocolate, Sponge finger cookies, Eggs, Strong coffee sweetened, 
Separate the egg and the yolks.  Set aside two white in another bowl.  Combine the yolks, the wine and the sugar and beat them together. Bring a  pan of water to just below boiling, then turn down to simmer and beat the  yolk mixture over the water until it begins to swell and thicken. (Use a  double-broiler or saucepan, if you have one.) Set the yolk mixture aside.  Whisk the two remaining whites into stiff peaks and fold them into the yolk  mixture, then set aside. Liquidize the cheese in a processor or blender and  fold into it the yolk and white mixture. Check the sweetness at this stage  and adjust it to taste. Dip each cookie in the coffee; let it soak well.  Arrange a floor of cookies on your dish then spread the cookies with a thin  coating of the egg/cheese mixture. Repeat the process until you have used  your last layer of egg/cheese. Run a knife around the edge of your little  building to smooth down the sides. Grate the chocolate and sprinkle it over  the sides and top. Chill until completely cold and set aside. Source:  Italian Cooking for Everyone - Diane Vowles, Editor.
