Rose Hansen & Associates (Sausalito, Ca.) donated this recipe which is  delicious served with saffron biryani, pilaf or couscous.    Dredge chops in flour and brown on both sides in hot oil in a Dutch  oven on medium heat.  Remove chops from pot and keep warm.  Saute  onion, garlic and spices in pot over low heat, stirring when needed,  until onion is limp. Add broth and chops.  Simmer covered until meat  is tender, about 50 minutes. Remove chops, keep warm.  Drain off  excess fat from pot, whisk in tomato paste and reduce liquid over  high heat to 1 1/2 cups. Meanwhile, mix last 5 ingredients together.  Pour hot sauce over meat, and serve with yogurt mixture around each  chop.    From "Wild About Saffron++A Contemporary Guide to an Ancient Spice",  by Ellen Szita.
