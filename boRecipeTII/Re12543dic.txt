Yeshimbra Asa (Pea Flour Fish)
Oil for frying, Chick pea flour*, Salt, Vegetable oil, Onions or shallots, chopped, Berbere, Cayenne, 
In a dry, heavy pot, stir the onions over low heat until browned. Add 1/3 c  water along with the cayenne, salt & oil. Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes & then  add another 2/3 c water & the berbere. Bring to a boil, cover & reduce  heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, add just enough water to the pea  flour to make a thick dough similar to that for rolled cookies. Try using  1/2 c water & add extra a teaspoonful at a time until the mixture adheres  to itself to form a ball. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface  to a thickness of a 1/4" & cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Ethiopians  make fish shapes & decorate them with all sorts of designs. Fry the pieces  in moderately hot oil in a heavy skillet for 3 to 4 minutes, turning  several times. When they are crisp & brown, cautiously spoon them into the  sauce in the pot.  Simmer gently for 5 or 6 minutes, being careful not to  break the shapes. Lift pieces out with a slotted spoon & drain on cloths.  Serve with the sauce. * Also called gram or garbanzo flour, it is easily  found in Asian foodstores.
