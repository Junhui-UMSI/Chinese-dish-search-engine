A Very Tasty Chili
(15-oz) tomatoes, Vegetable oil, Dried red New Mex chiles, Chipotles, Ground cumin, Dried origano, (15-oz) kidney beans, Onion, Habanero, Minced beef, Garlic, 
Cut the tops off the dried chiles.  Toast them in a hot frying pan for a  few minutes until fragrant and then soak them in hot water for 20 minutes.  Liquidise them with some of the soaking water.  Roughly chop the habanero  and the garlic and add them to the liquidiser along with the cumin and  origano. Puree some more.    Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the onion until softened.  Add the meat  and cook until browned.  Add the chile puree, tomatoes and beans.  Cover  and simmer for at least half an hour. Uncover, raise the heat a little and  allow the excess liquid to evaporate (about 10 minutes). Serve it any way  you fancy.
