I  have made this many times, and it is always a hit with everyone. You can  use other beans (white, pinto, etc.) and other vegetables in season. The  recipe says it "serves 4" but I served 6 last night and had a couple of  portions leftover!!!! This is also made very quickly if you use canned or  already cooked beans, and cut the veggies small for quicker cooking, so  its great for mid-week dinners. Mangia!    In a large pot, combine cabbage, onion, carrots, celery, potato, tomatoes,  and vegetable broth. Bring to a simmer over moderate heat. Cover, adjust  heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until vegetables are half done, about  15 minutes. Add zucchini, beans with their juice, and macaroni. Cover and  simmer until vegetables are tender and pasta is al dente, about 15 minutes.  Add oregano. Season to taste with salt & pepper.
