Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a baking stone in the oven or  sprinkle a baking sheet or pizza pan with cornmeal.    Toss together the zucchini, chiles, garlic, and lime juice in a small bowl.  Taste, and season with salt and pepper. Dust a work surface with cornmeal,  and place the pizza shell on it. Drizzle the olive oil over the shell, then  spread the zucchini mixture on top. Top with the cheese, spreading it  evenly over the zucchini. Scatter the parsley or cilantro over the cheese.    If you are using a baking stone, sprinkle it with cornmeal. Transfer the  pizza to the baking sheet, pizza pan, or baking stone. Bake the pizza until  the crust is lightly golden and the cheese bubbly, 15 to       20    minutes.    Meanwhile, cut the avocado in half, pit and peel it, and cut it lengthwise  into thin slices.    Remove the pizza from the oven, and let it rest for 5 minutes. Cut it into  8 slices, and top each one with avocado slices. Sprinkle salt, pepper and  crushed red pepper over the pizza, and serve immediately, with lime wedges  alongside.
