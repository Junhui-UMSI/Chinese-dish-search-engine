90-Minute Cinnamon Buns
All-purpose flour, Yeast, quick-rise, Sugar, Salt, milk, Water, Butter or margarine, Egg, Brown sugar, Cinnamon, Butter, Raisins, 
Set aside 1 cup flour. Mix remaining flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a  large bowl. Heat milk, water and 1/4 cup butter to 105-115 F. Stir liquids  into flour mix, stir to blend completely. Add the egg. Add enough of the  reserved flour to make a soft dough that does not stick to the bowl. Turn  out onto a floured surface and knead 5 times. Cover dough and let rest 10  minutes.    Mix brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together (amounts can be increased up  to 1 1/2 times given for extra sticky buns). Gently roll dough into a  12"x9" rectangle. Spread with cinnamon mixture and sprinkle with raisins if  desired.    Roll up from long side and pinch to seal the seam. Cut into 12 equal slices  with a sharp knife. Place cut side up in greased muffin tins. Place muffin  pan on a baking sheet on top of a large shallow pan half filled with  boiling water. Cover dough and let rise for 20 minutes.    Bake at 375 F. for 20 minutes or until browned. Remove from muffin tins  immediately to cool. Serve warm!    Typed by Bob 8-{)   Recipe from a neighbor.
