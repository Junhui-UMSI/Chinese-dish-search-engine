Combine all ingredients. Serve with slices of orange, lime or pineapple in  a tall glass with frozen fruit juice ice cubes. (Apricot or any fruit juice  mixed with water and frozen in ice cube trays. Make it fancy by dropping a  mint leaf or cherry into the ice cube.) Or for a diaquari effect, try  freezing 7-Up in ice cube tray. Or just plain ice. Whatever you have time  for.
