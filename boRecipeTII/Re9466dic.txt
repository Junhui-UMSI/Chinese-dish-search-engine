If the format seems  confusing, its for two different sized recipes.  She makes this for gifts.    Stir together the pumpkin, water, oil, sugar and spice mixture.  Sift flour  mixture into liquid mixture and stir.  Add fruits and nuts.  Is your arm  tired yet? Pour into greased 1-quart loaf pans. Bake at 350-degrees for 1  hour or until the toothpick test is passed.    More easily sliced for serving when bread is chilled or frozen (slices thaw  quickly).
