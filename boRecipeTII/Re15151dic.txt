Wheat Roast
Gluten flour, Peanut butter, Cumin powder, butter, Vegetable oil, Additional water, garlic, Black pepper, Water, Tamari, Ground coriander, Onion powder, Cider vinegar, Salt, Nutritional yeast, Garlic powder, 
Cut peanut butter or tahini into gluten flour (as you would shortening in  corn meal - this is my enhancement). Stir in nutritional yeast, cumin  powder, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper, mixing  well.    Add tamari and oil to one c of water and pour into gluten mix. Knead into a  rough ball and place into a slow cooker (crock pot) that has been sprayed  with non-stick spray.    Mix additional water (1 & 1/4 c) and cider vinegar and pour over gluten. (I  sometimes add about a tb and/or tamari of liquid smoke to add a bit of  flavor.  How about basil? Sprinkle it on. What the heck.)    Top gluten ball with margarine and garlic halves.    Cook in slow cooker on low setting for 5-7 hours.    Slice thinly and serve as you would roast beef. Makes great fajitas and  stir-fry pieces.    Note:  This recipe can also be cooked in a covered dish in a 250 degree F.  oven for 3-4 hours.    Note:  Makes a "leg of wheat" roast that weighs approx. two pounds. Double  the mix for four pounds but cook in 6-quart size crock pot.    At the urging of DEEANNE, I am sharing a secret recipe with you. I _hope_  it comes out for you.  If it doesnt, please keep it as your secret!    (The basics of this concoction are from Shirley Wilkes-Johnsons cooking  class.  Of course, Ive added some enhancements. I cant leave well enough  alone.)
