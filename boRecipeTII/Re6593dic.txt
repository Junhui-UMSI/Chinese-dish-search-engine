Heres a recipe for a Poblano Pesto that appears in _The Great Salsa Book_  and one that Ive enjoyed several times. Ill retype it (with my comments  like so):    The making: Toast the pumpkin seeds and let them cool. (I dry roast them in  a frying pan over medium heat until they stop popping. Theyll be all plump  and toasty-looking).    Heat the canola oil in a skillet and when almost smoking, turn the poblanos  in the hot oil for 45 seconds until blistered but not blackened. (the  chiles get a bit oily this way, but theyre not swimming in it and by  blistering the skins this way, the chiles retain more of a bright green  color) Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap (towels better - less  additional cooking happens that way), and let steam for 10 minutes (maybe a  bit longer - til theyre cool enough to handle). Peel and seed the  Poblanos, place in a food processor with the toasted pumpkin seeds, and  chop for about 1 minute. Add the cilantro and blend for 1 more minute. Add  the olive oil, lime juice, and salt, and run for 30 seconds longer, or  until smooth. (You can reserve some of the toasted pumpkin seeds to  sprinkle over the top)    I use this pesto as a pasta sauce or will put it on some chicken. Thats a  start. Enjoy!
