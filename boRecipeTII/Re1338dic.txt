Easiest Applesauce Ever
Macintosh Apples cored and, Water, Sugar, 
This recipe comes from my mother. This is what we begin all holiday cooking  with. All of my children (3 boys) and all of my grandchildren have made  applesauce with me.    Place in pot covered until apples are cooked through and have the look of  being melted almost.    Let cool until you are able to handle.    Sieve through using a Foley Food Mill in batches making sure that you have  gotten all of the essence.
