Baked Cornish Hens #1
Butter or margarine, orange marmalade, Salt and pepper to taste, Kitchen Bouquet, Cornish hens, white onions, pineapple, 
Clean and dry hens; season inside and out with salt and pepper;  refrigerate overnight. When ready to bake, insert a whole onion in cavity  of each hen and place in open roasting pan rack. Place a pineapple ring  under each hen, leaving a space between each hen.     In small saucepan put butter, Kitchen Bouquet and orange marmalade. Heat  together until butter has melted and mixture is blended. Spoon over hens  and bake at 350 degrees until hens are tender, about 1-1/2 hours, basting  often. If sauce cooks down before hens are done, add a little hot water to  the pan to assure having some of the delicious sauce left to accompany the  hens. If hens appear to be getting dry during the baking, place a piece of  foil loosely over the pan to retard the browning.     For entertaining, onions should be removed from the hens before serving;  as a family enjoyment, leave the onions in.    REFRIGERATE OVERNIGHT    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.
