Blanch the garlic for 1 minute, drain and peel. Cook it, but do not let it  brown, in half the oil for 10 minutes. Add the stock, thyme, salt and  plenty of white pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes and check the seasoning.    Sieve or blend the soup, keeping a few garlic cloves whole. Return the soup  to its saucepan and keep hot.    Beat the egg yolks and gradually add the remaining oil. Stir a couple of  spoonfuls of the soup into the egg mixture, remove the soup from the heat  and add the egg in a thin stream, stirring well.    Serve immediately with sliced French bread or toast, and a sprinkling of  grated cheese in each bowl.    Variation: Omit the oil and egg yolk mixture and poach six fresh eggs in  the simmering, unpureed soup.
