Measure 3/4 c of dough; flatten into disk.  Wrap  in plastic; chill. Using floured fingertips, press remaining dough over  bottom and up sides of 9" tart pan with removable bottom. Pierce dough in  several places with fork. Chill at least 1 hour. (Can be made 1 day ahead.  Keep chilled.)    Preheat 375o.
