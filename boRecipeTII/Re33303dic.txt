Basic Southern Tomato Sauce
Salt, Garlic, olive oil, Chopped parsley, Drained canned plum tomatoes, 
This is a typical southern Italian sauce. If you like it spicier, add  peperoncino (red pepper flakes).    COARSELY CHOP THE TOMATOES on a plate, saving the liquid they release.  Halve the garlic clove. Heat the olive oil in a broad saute pan and simmer  the garlic in it until lightly golden, then press the pieces against the  pan and remove them. Raise heat to medium-high and add the chopped tomatoes  and their juices from the plate. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10  minutes, until the sauce is lightly thickened. Add the chopped parsley and  1/4 teaspoon salt, stir all together once, then remove the sauce from the  heat.
