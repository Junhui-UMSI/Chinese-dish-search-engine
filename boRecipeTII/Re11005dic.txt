First, I made a big mess of curry. Mine was simple, probably not very  traditional, but Ive not made curry before, so I sorta freehanded it.  Anywho, it consisted of red curry paste (abt. 1 1/2 TBSP...sez its made in  Thailand, but it just didnt seem that hot...or at least not what I wuz  expecting...no mushroom clouds about my head...), abt. 3 TBSP fish sauce  (found some Colonel...thanks), a can of coconut milk, a couple TBSP chopped  fresh basil, about 2x that of chopped fresh cilantro (added at the end of  simmering), bamboo shoots, a portabello mushroom (hey, I had one..),  carrot, yellow onion, yellow bell pepper, 2 serranos, and I think that wuz  about it.    Simmer the coconut milk/curry paste abt. 10 minutes; add the rest, except  the cilantro, and simmer about 15 min., dump in the cilantro, eat.  Somewhere in there you need to make rice. I made plain ole rice.    All in all, simple, filling, hot, but not real hot, and Rael do feel good.  So, Im combining that with a big ole cup of hot tea (luv it as much as  coffee, but Im too lazy to wait for it to steep usually), some Bowie (no,  I dont listen to Jimi all the day long...close to it, but I do vary my  selection..), and some Bukowski. Toss in a cigarette or two, and there  aint but one thing that I could think of to make life better...but I shant  go there. Ha, like I *could*...jeez.    Peace, Hendrix, and Chiles.......
