4 Day Citrus Marmalade
Lemon, Whole oranges, Grapefruit, Water, Sugar; (4.4 lbs), 
Its not pure orange, but the best marmalade Ive ever made was a recipe  Mirj posted back in 1995:    Day 1:    1. Cut up oranges, grapefruit and lemon in small pieces.    2. Leave in pot of water for 24 hours.    Day 2:    1. Put pot on stove and boil for half an hour.    2. Set aside for 24 hours.    Day 3:    1. Put pot back on stove and boil for half an hour.    2. Add sugar and leave for 24 hours.    Day 4:    1. Simmer on low flame until marmalade is thick (3-4 hours).    2. Pour into jars. Seal lids.    This stuff is great to roast chicken with.
