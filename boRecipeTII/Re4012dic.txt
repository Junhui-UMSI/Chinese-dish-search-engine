Peppered Steak
Galric Cloves, peeled and, Sirloin Steaks, Excess fat, Heaped, Black Peppercorns, Slices of ginger, finely, Soy sauce, Butter, Oyster sauce, 
Preheat the oven to Gas Mark 6/400F/200C. Roughly pound the peppercorns and  fry, without oil, over a moderate heat for one minute or until you sneeze.  This should take about two minutes, but remove them as soon as you get a  strong spicy fragrance. In a frying pan heat the butter over a moderate  heat and when it has melted add the garlic and ginger and colour gently for  two minutes. Add the steaks and lightly brown on both sides. Transfer to  the oven and roast for five minutes, remove and keep warm. If you like your  meat well done, leave in the oven for another 3 or 4 minutes.    Add the crushed peppercorns, two tablespoons of oyster sauce and one  dessertspoon of soy sauce to the butter and cook over a moderate heat,  taking care not to burn the butter. Serve the steaks with the butter and  pepper poured over and some broccoli and new potatoes.    Source: Hugo Arnold, Evening Standard, London
