CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Toss the pecans and raisins with 1/2 c  flour and set aside.  Sift the remaining flour, the baking powder,  cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together and set aside.  Beat the butter and  sugar in a mixer bowl until light and fluffy.  Mash the bananas and beat  into the butter mixture.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after  each addition.  Fold in the sifted flour mixture and bourbon alternately,  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Fold in the pecan mixture.  Pour the batter into an ungreased 10" tube pan. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Cool and remove from the pan. Cut the cake in slices and serve with Bourbon  Creme Anglaise spooned over it. BOURBON CREME ANGLAISE: Heat the cream and  sugar in a small saucepan just until the sugar dissolves.  Remove from the  heat.  Whisk the egg yolks together in a mixing bowl. Slowly beat in a  third of the cream mixture; then whisk the egg yolks back into the cream  mixture.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, just until thickened. Be  careful not to let the mixture boil. Remove to a clean bowl. Stir in the  syrup and bourbon. Cool completely. From The Silver Palate Good Times  Cookbook by Julee Russo & Sheila Lukins.
