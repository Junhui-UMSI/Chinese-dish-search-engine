submitted by: sgjg6566@usa.pipeline.com (Julie, Michigan, USA)  This is another twist on Macaroni and cheese--my kids love it!    Cook bacon, saving about 1/4 cup of drippings. Crumble bacon, reserving 4  or 5 strips for the top of dish. Saute onion in remaining drippings. Add  cheese soup, milk, Wrocestershire sauce and mustard; mix well and heat  through. Stir in the bacon, macaroni, shredded cheese and pimiento. Place  in casserole dish (I use 3 quart). Top with remaining strips of bacon. Bake  in a 375 degree oven for 25 minutes. Enjoy!!
