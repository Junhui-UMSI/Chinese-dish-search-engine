Mix milk, butter and sugar and heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves.  Cool to lukewarm. Beat in egg. Add yeast and enough flour to make a soft  dough. Knead 8 to 10 minutes. Grease dough. Place in a greased bowl and  cover. Let rise in a warm place 1 to 1 1/2 hours or overnight in  refrigerator. Punch down. Form small lumps of dough the size of a walnut  into 2 inch circles. Put 2 or 3 pecan pieces and 2 or 3 raisins in center  of circel and form into a ball. Dip balls in melted butter. Roll in  cinnamon/sugar mixture. In bottom of bundt pan or tube pan, melt 2  Tablespoons of butter. Mix 1/4 cup raisins, 1/4 cup pecans, 1/2 t cinnamon  and 1/2 cup brown sugar and spread over bottom of pan. Stack nut filled  balls evenly over topping. Cover and let rise 2 hours or overnight in  refrigerator. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until browned. Invert and  leave pan on top while hot to spread topping. When all topping has run out,  take pan off and serve. May serve hot or cold by slicing or by pulling off  "bubbles". This recipe was given to me in Foods 101 in college and used by  me for teaching the last 23 years. It is also a Christmas favorite at our  house. I make it on Christmas Eve and let the final rising be in the  refrigerator overnight. We bake it while opening presents on Christmas  morning and the yeasty cinnamon/sugar smell accompanies our gift exchanges.
