Pierogi Dough
All-purpose flour, Salt, Eggs, Water, 
This is my Grandmothers recipe, and Ive eaten many dozens of Pierogi from  it.  My personal favorite is the cheese filling, but Ill also include the  sauerkraut filling.  By the way, these come from Poland. Mound flour on  bread board with a well in the center.  Drop eggs and  salt into well. Add  water, working from center to outside of mound, mix  flour into liquid in  center with one hand and keep dough mounded with  the other. Knead until  well mixed and firm.  Cover dough with a warm  bowl and let rest 10  minutes. Divide dough into halves.  Roll out 1/2 dough on floured surface  as thin as possible.  If it gets too thick, it turns noodle-like and they  are no good.  Cut 3 inch rounds with biscuit cutter or bowl mouth. Place  filling a little to one side of center.  Moisten edges with water fold over  and pinch edges together.  Be sure they are sealed well or all the filling  will leak out.  Drop pierogi into boiling water.  Cook gently 3-5 minutes,  or until they float.  Lift out of water with perforated spoon, and drop  them into a frying pan with butter or margarine. Fry until golden. This  recipe yields only about a dozen.  I always double or triple it. If Im  going to go thru the trouble of making them, Im going to freeze some too.  If you want to freeze them, make sure you boil them first, then rub  margarine on them so they dont stick together in the freezer. Then thaw in  the microwave and drop them in the frying pan.
