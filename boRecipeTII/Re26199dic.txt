Bring it to a boil and add all ingredients except shrimp.  Raw shrimp  (about 15 to the pound in size) are placed on the table (in Thailand we  dont bother cleaning them - you might want to remove the heads, legs and  shells, and devein them), together with fresh mushrooms. The guests then  cook these by placing them in small bronze-wire baskets and dipping them in  the suki pot. If you are using fondue forks, you might want to add the  mushrooms to the soup liquor just before everyone starts to dine.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #246    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
