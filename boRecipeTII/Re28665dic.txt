Texas Hash (Slightly Adapted)
tomatoes, Ground beef, Onion, long-grain rice, cooked, Sweet green pepper, Salt to taste, Chili powder, 
Cook the meat, onions and sweet pepper in a frying pan  until the meat is browned and the vegetables are  tender.  Drain off any excess fat. Add the tomatoes,  chili powder, and simmer briefly.  Salt to taste. Mix  the meat mixture with the rice, and place in a  casserole.  Bake at 350 until the mixture is hot and  lightly browned. We also like this topped with grated  cheddar or Parmesan cheese (added just before baking).
