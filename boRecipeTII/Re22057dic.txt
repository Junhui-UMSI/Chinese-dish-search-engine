Mix together turkey, cheese and chilies; set aside. In a different bowl,  mix together flour, cornmeal and salt. Cut in butter until particles are  the size of small peas (a pastry blender makes this an easy job). Sprinkle  with water and mix with pastry blender or fork until pastry can be formed  into a ball.  Add a little more water if necessary. Divide dough into  balls, one ball for each two servings; divide turkey mixture into same  number as dough. Turn one dough ball onto floured board and roll into an  11" square. Place on oiled cookie sheet. Spoon one part of turkey mixture  over 1/2 of pastry, coming to 1 1/2" of the edge. Fold other half of pastry  over it, and crimp edges to seal them. Repeat this procedure with each ball  of dough. Brush turnovers with milk.  Sprinkle remaining corn meal on top.  Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool  slightly; slice into wedges to serve.                                      -- per James Lor                                       Fidonet COOKING echo
