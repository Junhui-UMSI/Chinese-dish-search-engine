Bean Salad
Onions, Vinegar, Salad oil or melted butter, Fresh green beans, Salt and pepper, 
Evelyn Scoville    The cook of this period would have been likely to cook the beans far more  tender than currently is trendy and to use melted butter in the dressing,  since vegetable oil-except olive oil-still was little used.    Young green beans make an excellent salad. String them, cut them into inch  lengths, boil them in salted water until tender, and drain them. Beat the  vinegar and water together. Add the salt, pepper, and the onion, and pour  over the beans and onions. Mix well and set away for an hour or two before  using for the tastes to blend.
