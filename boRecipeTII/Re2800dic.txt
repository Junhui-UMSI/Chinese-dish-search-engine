Add egg and beat thoroughly. Sift remaining ingredients  together; divide in half and add to creamed mixture, one at a time, mixing  till well blended after each addition.  Shape dough into 1-1/4-inch balls  and place 3 inches apart on lightly greased cookie sheets. Flatten with  fork making criss-cross pattern, or use cookie stamps. Bake at 375F for  about 10 minutes. (makes about 3 dozen)    NOTE:  Recipe called for "2/4" tsp baking soda, so I assume that this is a  typo, but I dont know if it should be "1/4" or "3/4" or "2/3", etc--Glen    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
