Strain, pressing solids with a spoon to extract all juices.  Combine tamarind with remaining ingredients in a small saucepan and stir  over moderate heat until honey dissolves. Cool.    NOTE: These delicious sounding glazes, with nary a bit of fat (I have not  changed them at all),  were of course originally designed to go with and  flavor meat.  If any of you use them, please write and let us know what you  used them on, how you cooked it, and how it turned out.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #136    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
