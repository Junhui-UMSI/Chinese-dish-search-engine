No one can figure out exactly what this is when they taste  it, but they love it anyway.    Place two whole graham crackers side by side on a plate (long sides  together).  Spread with a thin layer of apple butter.  Top with two more  graham crackers.  Spread with another thin layer of apple butter.  Continue  until you have a stack about 4" high, finishing with graham crackers.  "Frost" with Cool Whip on all sides (except the bottom, of course! (g) ).  Refrigerate overnight. Slice from one short end. This is beautiful and  tasty!    EAT-L Digest 22 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
