4 Egg Butter Cake
Cake Flour, Sugar, Shortening (pareve), Vanilla, Baking Powder, Salt, Water, Eggs, 
>From The Complete American Jewish Cookbook (pg. 126)    note: I will be giving my pareve version of the cake:    Sift together flour,baking powder and salt.  Cream shortening until smooth.  Gradually add sugar, creaming until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a  time, beating after each addition. Add dry ingred. alternately with water.  Add vanilla.    cake: bake for 25 min. in medium oven.    cupcakes: fill greased cupcake pans 2/3 full.  Bake in moderate oven 20-25  min.  yield: 24 cupcakes.    Note: I put paper "cups" in the cupcake pans and spray them with kal-shemen  (a low fat spray) before filling with batter.  you can ice the cupcakes or  add any topping you like.
