1. Wash raw rice. Soak overnight in water to cover. Then drain well.    2. Blanch walnuts. Grind walnuts and rice to a fine powder, either by hand  (with a mortar and pestle) or in a food mill.    3. Gradually stir the powder to a smooth paste with the second quantity of  water; then stir in the third quantity.    4. Strain mixture through a double thickness of cheesecloth into the top of  a double boiler. Gather together corners of the cheesecloth and squeeze  every possible drop of liquid into the pan. Add sugar and the fourth  quantity of water.    5. Bring remaining water to a boil in the lower half of the double boiler;  then reduce heat to medium. Cook walnut-rice mixture over it, stirring  constantly until it thickens (7 to 10 minutes). Serve hot, in small bowls.    NOTE: This mixture, also known as Flowing Walnut Pudding, may be reheated,  but only over extremely low heat to prevent burning. VARIATIONS:    1. For the rice, substitute 1/2 cup glutinous rice. Wash thoroughly; then  soak 10 minutes in water to cover. In step 3, use 1 cup of the rice-soaking  water to make the smooth paste.    2. Omit the rice. After grinding the walnuts, simmer them 30 minutes in  water to cover. (Omit step 3.) Strain the walnuts as in step 4; then add  the sugar and water. Pick up step 5, adding to the mixture 1/4 cup rice  flour.    3. In step 5, add to the walnut-rice mixture 12 Chinese red dates which  have been cooked in 1 to 2 cups boiling water until soft (about 20  minutes), then pureed through a fine sieve or ricer to remove the skins and  pits.
