Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cupcakes with Chocolate Icing
Semisweet chocolate chips, Egg, Unsalted butter, Heavy cream, All-purpose flour, Vanilla, Chunky peanut butter, Double-acting baking powder, Firmly packed dark brown, milk, 
In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder and a pinch of salt.  In another bowl with an electric mixer cream together the brown sugar, the  peanut butter, and the butter and beat in the    egg and the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk,  beating well after each addition, and stir in 1/2 cup of the chocolate  chips. Divide the batter among 12 paper-lined 1/2-cup muffin tins and bake  the cupcakes in the middle of a preheated 350 F oven for 20 to 25 minutes,  or until a tester comes out clean. Turn the cupcakes out onto a rack and  let them cool completely.    In another bowl combine the remaining 3/4 cup chocolate chips and the  cream, scalded, let the chips soften, and whisk the mixture until it is  smooth. Let the icing cool completely, whisk it until it is fluffy, and  spread it on the cupcakes.    Yield: 12 cupcakes    NOTES : (Courtesy of Gourmet Magazine)    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8819    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #482 by Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net>  on Feb 12, 1997.
