Pork Chile Rellenos (Pork Stuffed Chiles) Pt 2
See part 1, 
solution for about 30 minutes.) Rinse the chiles and pat them dry. Stuff  the chiles until they are well filled out. If you are using bell peppers,  add some chopped fresh chile to make them a little picante. Set them aside  on paper toweling while you make the batter. Prepare the batter: Heat the  oil until it starts to smoke. Meanwhile, beat the egg whites until they are  stiff, but not too dry. Add the salt and egg yolks one by one, beating well  after each addition. Pat the chiles completely dry (or the batter will not  adhere) and sprinkle them lightly with flour. Coat them with the batter.  Fry the chiles in the hot fat, turning them from time to time, until they  are an even gold all over. Drain the chiles on the paper toweling and place  them in the tomato broth--it should come about halfway up the chiles--to  heat through over a low flame. Serve immediately. Variation: Chiles  Rellenos De Queso (Chiles Stuffed With Cheese) Follow the instructions for  Chiles Rellenos but stuff the chiles with slices of mozzarella or mild  Cheddar cheese instead of the picadillo. In Mexico the braided queso de  Oaxaca is generally used. garhow@hpubmaa.esr.hp.com    Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Walt Gray <waltgray@MNSINC.COM> on Sep 18, 1997
