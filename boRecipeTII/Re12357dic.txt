Cut it into strips by cutting the squash  lengthwise into 6ths or 8ths, depending on its size.  Cut into 2-3" strips.  Place the pieces skin side down on a heavy baking sheet, iron skillet,  baking stone or other device that gets very hot, having sprayed the pan  v-e-r-y lightly with cooking spray - just enough so they wont stick. If  you have an old steak platter (a heavy insert with a wooden board for  serving), this works real well.    Sprinkle very lightly with a small amount of salt or your favorite  seasoning.    Bake at 375 degrees until the moisture is almost gone, but they are not  dried out, approximately 15-20 minutes. Do not turn over while baking. Eat  as is or dip into pasta sauce.    fatfree digest V96 #205    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
