Canned Poppy Seed Cake
Flour, Salt, Baking Powder, Sugar, Poppy seeds, Eggs, Cooking oil, milk, Almond extract, Vanilla extract, GLAZE, Vanilla extract, Butter flavoring, Almond flavoring, Nutmeg, Orange juice, Powdered sugar (sifted), 
Grease 5 wide-mouth pint canning jars.  Divide dough evenly between jars.  (Jars will be slightly over 1/2 full.)  Bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.  Pull jars out of oven 1 at a time.  Pour glaze over hot bread. Immediately  apply and firmly tighten a two-piece wide-mouth canning lid.    The lid will form a vacuum seal as the jar cools. Jars of canned bread may  be stored on the pantry shelf with other canned foods or may be placed in a  freezer.  The bread is safe to eat as long as jars remain vacuum sealed and  free of mold growth.    Original Source not noted on file    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by DENISE ROUNDS on Sep 14, 98
