Sweet Rice Pudding Cake (Bok Tong Go)
compressed yeast, Water, Long grain rice, Sugar, 
PREPARATION: Soak rice in water (have sufficient water     to cover 1 inch  above level of rice) for 2 days. Drain     well. Mix compressed yeast with  1/2 cup lukewarm water. Add 1/4 cup sugar. Cover and set in warm place  while you do the next step. Put 1/2 of the soaked rice     and 1/2 cup  water into blender and blend at high speed     until rice is liquified and  mixture is smooth (about 3     to 4 minutes). Set aside in mixing bowl.  Blend             remaining rice and water by 1/2 cup quantities, setting  aside each portion into the same mixing bowl.      Now pour the entire  mixture back into blender and add      1 1/4 cups sugar. Blend at high  speed for 2 more minutes. Add yeast mixture and blend at low speed for 30  seconds. Pour into mixing bowl, cover and leave in      a warm place until  mixture is bubbly and almost double     in bulk (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours).  STEAMING: Start          water in steamer boiling. Lightly stir batter  again to mix evenly. Pour batt er into round or square cake pan to about  1/2 inch high. Steam for 12-15 minutes. Cool completely. Lightly rub a  little oil on top to give it a glossy appearance. Cut into diamond shapes.  Pudding      is eaten when it is at room temperature. DO-AHEAD NOTES: Bok  Tong Go is a perfect dessert recipe, since it must cool completely before  serving. The pudding cake will keep for 2-3 days at room temperature.  COMMENTS: The rice needs to be soaked for     2 days so it will be easily  liquefied. The fermenting      process is extremely important, so dont  hurry it. The textural appearance in the cross section of the Pudding, cake  should be one full of holes (air             pockets) throughout. Ms. Yee  has tried using rice          flour, but it has a much coarser texture and  a most unpleasant odor. The recipe itself appears deceptively simple. The  secret is in the proper proportion of          ingredients and technique in  combining the m. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted for MM by  Karen Adler FNGP13B.
