Slice eggplants lengthwise into 1/4" slices:sprinkle with a little salt.Let  drain in colander for 30 minutes.Bake on greased baking sheets at 350  degree oven for 15 minutes.Turn and bake a further 15 minutes.    In nonstick pan,cook onion and garlic,stirring for 2 minutes.Add chick  peas,mashing slightly.Stir in tomatoes,oregano,basil,cinnamon,pepper and a  little salt.Bring to boil.Reduce to simmer,cook uncovered for 20  minutes,stirring occasionally.Process in food processor until mixture  resembles coarse meal.    Lightly spray 9 X 13 pan with Pam.Layer half the eggplant,then all the  chickpea mixture,a little parmesan.(I used bread crumbs-very dry ones),then  the remaining eggplant.    Topping:in food processor,puree tofu,onion,egg whites and nutmeg.Spread  over Moussaka.Sprinkle with a little parmesan(I used bread crumbs seasoned  with a little oregano and pepper).    Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.Serves 8.  For extra texture,you  can use grilled green peppers,zucchini to the eggplant layer.I might try  mushrooms also next time.
