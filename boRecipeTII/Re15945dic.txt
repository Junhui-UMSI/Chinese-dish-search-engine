Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste.  Look  for them at Mexican and Latin American markets. Adobo marinade goes  particularly well with pork.    Juice the oranges and lime. Finely chop chilies and garlic. Place citrus  juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar and salt in  blender and puree until smooth.    Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    From the MealMaster recipe list.
