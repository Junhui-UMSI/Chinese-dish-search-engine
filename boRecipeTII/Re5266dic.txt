Pina Colada Cake in a Jar
Unbleached flour, Pineapple crushed  , Baking Powder, Rum, Brown Sugar, Margarine, Baking soda, Coconut, Eggs, 
Preheat oven at 325. Before starting batter, wash 8 (1 pint) wide mouth  canning jars with lids in hot soapy water and let drain, dry, and cool to  room temperature. Generously prepare jars with cooking spray and flour.  Drain pineapple for 10 minutes, reserving juice. Puree drained pineapple in  a blender. Measure out 1 1/2 cups puree, adding a little juice if necessary  to make 1 1/2 cups. Set puree aside. Discard remaining juice. In a mixing  bowl, combine applesauce, half brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in  eggs and pineapple puree. Set aside. In another mixing bowl, combine flour,  baking powder, and baking soda. Gradually, add to pineapple mixture in  thirds, beating well with each addition. Stir in coconut. Spoon 1 level  cupful of batter into each jar. Carefully wipe rims clean, then place jars  on baking sheet (or theyll tip over) in the center of oven. Bake 40  minutes. Keep lids in hot water until theyre used. When cakes are done,  remove jars which are HOT from oven one at a time. If rims need cleaning,  use moistened paper towel. Carefully put lids and rings in place, then  screw tops on tightly shut. Place jars on a wire rack; they will seal as  they cool.
