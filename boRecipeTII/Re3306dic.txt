Add 3 cups milk to  these ingredients and cook them for 3 hours in a double boiler - over - not  in - hot water. Cool. Preheat oven to 325 F. Beat and add egg yolks, lemon  rind and juice and sugar.  Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Line  a baking dish with a layer of the tapioca mixture, a layer of the egg  whites, another layer of tapioca and end with the egg whites on top. Bake  for about 15 minutes. Serve hot or cold, with or without a sauce such as a  fruit sauce. Recipe is from _The Joy of Cooking_.    EAT-L Digest 26 June 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
