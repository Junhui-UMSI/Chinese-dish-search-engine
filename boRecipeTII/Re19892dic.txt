Sauteing  them first to let the water evaporate ensures a crisp crust.  Prep time: 1  hour plus cooling Baking time: 35 to 40 minutes    Apple Layer: Peel and slice apples.  Melt butter in Dutch oven over high  heat.  Add apples, sugar and cinnamon; cook, stirring occasionally, until  apples are tender and juices are evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes.  Cool.    Nut Mixture: Combine all ingredients in small bowl.  Preheat oven to 400^F.  Trim phyllo sheets to 13x9-inch rectangles; cover with plastic wrap.  Brush  13x9-inch metal baking pan with butter.  Place 1 phyllo sheet in pan and  brush with some of the melted butter (keep remaining phyllo covered). Layer  5 more phyllo sheets on top, brushing each with butter. Spread 2 cups nut  mixture on top and repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and butter.  Spread apple mixture on top; repeat layering with 6 more phyllo sheets and  butter. Sprinkle remaining nut mixture on top; sprinkle with bread crumbs  and layer with the 6 remaining phyllo sheets and butter. With sharp knife,  cut lengthwise through pastry and filling into 1 1/2 inch-wide strips, then  cut diagonally at 2-inch intervals to make diamonds. Bake 35 to 40 minutes  or until golden. Drizzle honey on top and bake 5 minutes more. Cool in pan  on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped or ice cream.  Makes 12 servings.
