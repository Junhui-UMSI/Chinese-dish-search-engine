*Pasta with Marinated Tomatoes, Capers, Olives, Garlic, Chilies, and Herbs.  Authors note:  "This pasta dish would not be the same without the piquancy  it picks up from the capers, and from its Italian name. The dish loosely  translates as bad woman pasta, as several other lusty tomato and garlic  and herb pasta dishes do.  Legend has it that these dishes are so named  because they are very aromatic and lure customers in when other charms  fail. Another explanation is that the dishes are so quick they can be  prepared between customers."    Combine olive oil with olives, capers, garlic, tomatoes, basil, salt, and  pepper flakes.  Let sit and marinate for half hour if possible. Cook penne  in rapidly boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and toss with sauce.  Serve immediately, or let cool and enjoy as a salad.
