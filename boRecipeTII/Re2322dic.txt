Basic White Sauce
Salt, seasonings, Milk, Butter, Flour, 
Melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the flour, stirring  continuously over a medium heat `til mixture begins to bubble. Now,  gradually stir in the milk until smooth and desired thickness is achieved.  Then add your seasonings as desired. (i.e. salt and pepper, etc)    *Note: For a thinner white sauce, reduce the flour and butter to 1  tablespoon each. For a thicker white sauce, increase the flour and other to        3    tablespoons each.    **Note For an Alfredo sauce add garlic powder, onion powder, and Parmesan  cheese as desired to your particular taste.    ...I was surfin the net and look what I found...!
