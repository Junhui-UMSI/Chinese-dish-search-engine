>From the rfcj newsgroup ...    Cook noodles until barely tender. Drain well, return to pot and toss  briefly with 3 Tbs. oil. Keep warm on stove (without cover). Pour remaining  oil in saucepan. Add sugar and cook over low heat, shaking pan gently,  cooking until sugar turns dark brown (may take 15-25 minutes). Gradually  add to noodles, mixing carefully. Beat eggs with salt, pepper and cayenne.  Add to noodles and mix well. Adjust seasonings (mixture should accent a  peppery flavor). Place mixture in greased 7-8 cup casserole. Cover with  foil and lid. (May be refrigerated 3-4 hours.) Bake overnight in 180-degree  oven (14 hours). Loosen edges and turn out onto platter. Serve hot. Quicker  method: Bake uncovered in 350-degree oven for an hour. Cut as you would cut  a cake.
