STEP ONE:    Combine marinade ingredients in a large pot.  Boil for 10 minutes.  Let  mixture cool.  Add beef, and marinate in refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.    STEP TWO:    Simmer beef in marinade until tender, on low heat.  Add water as needed so  meat is covered with liquid.    STEP THREE:    Strain liquid.  Discard vegetables and spices.  Cut cooled beef into 1/2  inch slices.    To the liquid, add sour cream thickened with corn starch [note from Jocie:  works better if you add sour cream first, then mix corn starch with a  little milk before adding] , and the kitchen bouquet (just enough to add a  little color).    Cook gravy, stirring constantly, until perfectly smooth and slightly  thickened.    Add sliced beef to the gravy, and bring to a full boil.
