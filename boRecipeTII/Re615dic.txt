The following recipe is very easy to do and is great for Shabbat lunch,  especially in the summer.    Source: my friend Eleanor    Chunk first four ingredients and puree in food processor with metal blade.  Add (salt) and pepper, wine vinegar and 1 c. tomato juice; blend in  processor. Add to rest of tomato juice. If you like it a little spicy (I  do), put in some tabasco sauce.    For company, I dice some chives and float on top.
