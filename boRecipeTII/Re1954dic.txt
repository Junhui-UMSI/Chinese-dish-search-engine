Chocolate Grand Marnier Sauce
Silken soft tofu; *, Cocoa powder, Maple syrup; to 4 tbs, Grand Marnier; to 3 tbs, Vanilla extract, Strawberries or sliced fresh, 
* For best results, use the fresh (refrigerated) tofu, not aseptic-packed.    Makes 1 1/2 cups.    Drain the tofu in a fine-mesh strainer for 15 minutes.    In a blender or food processor, puree the tofu until creamy, about 30  seconds. Add the cocoa powder, maple syrup, Grand Marnier, and the vanilla  extract. Blend thoroughly, scraping down the sides of the container. Blend  until the mixture is extremely smooth.    Transfer to a well-sealed container and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Keeps  for up to three days.    NOTES : "This rich, velvety topping has a lovely sheen and makes an elegant  dessert when spooned over small whole strawberries." [Lorna Sass]  Alternatively, use this sauce over sliced fresh peaches, lowfat pound cake,  or angel food cake. It can even be consumed alone, as a pudding.
