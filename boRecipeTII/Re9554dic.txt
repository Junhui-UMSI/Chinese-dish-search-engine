Pumpkin Chocolate Crunch Pie

For a change of pace this season, try a version of pumpkin pie that  requires no baking. Simply fill a graham cracker crust with a light pumpkin  cream. Chocolate chips and almonds add flavor and crunch.    1.  Pour milk into mixing bowl. Add pie filling mix.    2.  Beat with wire whisk until well blended, 1 minute. Mixture will be  thin. Let stand 5 minutes.    3.  Blend in pumpkin, spice, almonds, chops and 2 cups of the whipped  topping. Spoon into pie crust.    4.  Chill at least 4 hours. Just before serving, spread with remaining  whipped topping. Garnish with chocolate curls.
