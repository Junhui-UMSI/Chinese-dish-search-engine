Melt the margarine and place it in a small mixing bowl.  Blend in the sugar  and beat in the egg.  Add the rest of the ingredients and stir, just until  the mixture is smooth.  Spoon the batter into muffin tins, that have been  sprayed with a non stick spray, (Pam or something like that), filling the  cups half full.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes, or until  done.  Cool on a rack before serving.    From "Make Mine Healthy" by Mimi Morgan.
