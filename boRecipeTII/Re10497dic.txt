* Use your choice of canned biscuits, usually sold in cans of 8-10 biscuits  or cans of 5 giant-sized.    1. In small bowl, mix the cinnamon and sugar. Mix the chopped raisins,  minced apricots and chopped nuts in another bowl. Place the nut mixture  into the bottom of a lightly greased 10 or 12-inch oven-proof dish or pan.  2. Cut each biscuit into 4 pieces; coat in the sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Place the coated biscuits atop the nut mixture, fitting into the pan  lightly. Keep stacking until all are used. 3. Melt the margarine; add the  brown sugar and orange zest. Pour this very carefully and evenly over the  biscuit pieces. Bake in a preheated 375-degree oven for about 20 minutes,  checking after 15 minutes. 4. Invert onto serving dish immediately. Serve  warm.
