Strawberry Crumb Pie
Salt, Minute tapioca, Solid vegetable shortening, Cinnamon, Sugar, Fresh strawberries, Flour, Light brown sugar, (To 3 T) water, 
Mix strawberries with sugar and tapioca.  Let stand while making pastry.  Combine flour and salt in bowl. Cut in shortening until uniform, but  coarse.  Reserve about 1/2 cupful of mixture; set aside. Sprinkle water  over remaining mixture in bowl; toss with fork and press into ball. Roll on  lightly-floured board to fit pie plate. Fill with strawberry mixture. Cut  an 8 inch round piece of foil; lay over filling. Bake in preheated 400 oven  for 35 minutes.  Blend reserved 1/2 cupful of flour mixture, brown sugar  and cinnamon. Remove foil; sprinkle mixture over pie. Continue baking for  30-40 minutes or until crust and crumb topping are browned. Cool.    Note:  If pie bubbles over during baking, place a sheet of foil beneath it.
