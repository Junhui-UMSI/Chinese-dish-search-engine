1,2,3,4 Cake
Lemon extract, Baking Powder, Flour, Milk (minus 1 tbsp), Eggs, Vanilla, Sticks butter, Sugar, 
When a southern lady, and she is a lady, told me about this cake I  responded with utter ignorance. She could not believe that I had never  heard of such a thing. The recipe resembles a fine pound cake in terms of  both flavor and texture. Sliced thin, with a cup of black coffee, it makes  a wonderful southern afternoon snack.      Using an electric mixer, cream the butter, sugar, and egg yolks. Mix the  flour and baking powder together and sift into the creamed mixture, adding  alternately with the milk. Add the flavorings. Whip the egg whites to form  stiff peaks and gently fold into the batter. Bake in a loaf pan in a  preheated oven at 300? for 1-1/4 hours, or until a toothpick stuck into the  center of the cake comes out clean.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
