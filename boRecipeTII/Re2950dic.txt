Cool whip or whipped cream, milk, Creamy peanut butter, Sugar, Cornstarch, Chocolate chips, 6-oz prepared pie crust, 
submitted by: PPFQP@aol.com  This is just about the easiest pie Ive ever made! The directions here are  a microwave method, but it can be made just as easily on the stovetop.    In large, microwavable bowl, combine sugar and cornstarch. Gradually stir  in milk, stirring until smooth. Microwave on high 7-9 minutes, stopping 3  times to stir mixture with a wire whisk or fork. You want the mixture to  come to a boil. Once it does, continue heating on high for one minute.  Remove from microwave and stir in peanut butter til the mixture is creamy.  Reserve 1/2 cup and set aside in refrigerator to chill. To the remaining  mixture, add the chocolate chips and stir in til melted. Pour into pie  shell and refrigerate. When the peanut butter mixture is chilled, gently  fold into Cool Whip or whipped cream. Spread evenly on top of pie. Garnish  with stripes and swirls of chocolate syrup, chopped peanuts or chocolate  chips.
