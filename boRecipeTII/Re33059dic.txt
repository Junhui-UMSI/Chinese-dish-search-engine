Basic Curry Powder (Indian Curry)
Ground ginger, coriander seeds, Dried red chilies, Cumin seeds, Fresh curry leaves, Black peppercorns, Ground turmeric, Mustard seeds, Fenugreek seeds, 
This medium-hot curry blend can be used in any dish that calls for curry  powder.    Remove the seeds from the chilies. Dry roast the whole spices over a medium  heat until they darken, stirring or shaking the pan frequently to prevent  burning. Leave to cool, then grind to a powder. Dry roast the curry leaves  in the pan for a few minutes, then grind and add them to the mixture with  the ginger and turmeric, blending well.    * To make Aromatic Curry Powder, add 1 tsp ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp  ground cloves with the ginger and turmeric, and use only 2 or 3 chilies.
