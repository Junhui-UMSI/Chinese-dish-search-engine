Tortilla a la Espanola
Onions, Eggs, Salt & fresh black pepper, olive oil, Potatoes, 
1.  Cut the onions into thin slices. Peel & thinly slice the potatoes.    2.  Heat all but 4 tbs. oil in 1 or 2 very large frying pans. Cook onions  over medium heat for 5 mins. Add the potato slices & salt & pepper to  taste, & cook for another 5-8 mins., or until potatoes are soft. Transfer  onions & potatoes to a colander & drain off the oil. Thoroughly beat eggs  in a large bowl & stir in vegetables.    3.  Heat the remaining 4 tbs. oil in a large frying pan over high heat. The  oil should be very hot. Add the omelette mixture to the pan & cook over  medium heat for 3-4 mins. If you are feeling adept, flip the tortilla w/ a  quick flick of the wrist. Alternately, place a large plate over the frying  pan, invert tortilla onto plate, & slide it, uncooked side down, back into  pan. Cook other side 4 mins. Cut into wedges & serve at once.
