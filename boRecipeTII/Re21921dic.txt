Apples in Maple Syrup
Apples; halved & cored, Maple syrup, Water, Butter, 
Such a special treat. Apple seeds were brought from England, but the  wonderful flavor of maple syrup was here waiting for those apples. This is  the legitimate ancestor of the more common baked apple.      Place the apples in a tightly fitting baking dish, cut side up. Mix the  remaining ingredients and pour over the apples. Bake at 350?, uncovered,  for 1-1/2 to 2 hours, or until the apples are soft and the syrup has  reduced and is fairly thick. Baste 3 or 4 times during the baking process.
