Artichoke and Cracked Wheat Bread Abm
Black pepper, BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER, Cracked wheat, WATER; WARM, Parmesan, Sugar, Yeast, Salt, Bread flour, Whole wheat flour, Marinated artichoke hearts, 
Drain artichoke hearts, reserving 3 tb liquid.    Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" at 10 oclock. Select "white bread" and push Start.    In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.    Since the flavor of this loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is  substantial, it is a good sandwich bread for spicy meats, such as salami or  pate, and ripe cheese. For early in the day eating, toast and spread with  orange marmalade or apple butter.    Tested in DAK R2D2.
