Pizza Dough Martha Stewart
Salt, Warm water, Active dry yeast, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, All-purpose flour, 
In a small bowl, combine 1/2 cup warm water and yeast. Let stand 10  minutes, or until creamy, then stir well.    Combine flour and salt in a food processor. Add yeast mixture and olive oil  and process just until the dough comes together.    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1 mintues.  Shape dough into a log and cut into 4 equal pieces. Flatten each piece  lightly with the palm of your hand to form a disc.    Place discs on a well-oiled cookie sheet and brush tops lightly with olive  oil. Cover discs with a large piece of plastic wrap and then cover with a  hot, damp cloth. Let stand in a warm place until dough has douled in bulk,  about 1 hour. Dough is now ready to be rolled into a crust about 7 inches  in diameter.
