At the end of each month, The Cook & Kitchen Staff select some of the best  recipes sent to Recipe-a-Day during the month, and post them to the entire  membership. Todays offering is from Recipe-a-Day member J. Stric, and its  just in time for your holiday entertaining menu!    Our recipe contributor recommends that you use a bundt cake pan to freeze  your pineapple juice into the shape of a festive wreath to float in your  punch bowl. Or, if you dont happen to have a bundt cake pan handy, you may  want to add a half-cherry to each compartment of an ice cube tray to freeze  your pineapple juice.    Mix lemonade, orange juice, white grape juice, white soda, and champagne in  punch bowl. Add frozen pineapple ring to chill 15 minutes prior to serving.  Garnish with lemon and orange slices, if desired.    Posted to dailyrecipe@recipe-a-day.com by Recipe-a-Day  <recipe-a-day@bignetwork.com> on Nov 30, 1998, converted by MM_Buster  v2.0l.
