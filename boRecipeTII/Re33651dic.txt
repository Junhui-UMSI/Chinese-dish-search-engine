Preheat oven to 425?.    Rub the potatoes all over with the butter or margarine and bake in  preheated oven for one hour, pricking them several times with a fork AFTER  the first 30 minutes of baking.    At the end of the hour baking time, remove the baked potatoes from the  oven; when JUST cool enough to handle, cut a lengthwise slice from the top  of each potato.  Then cut an X in the pulp of each potato, cut around the  circumference; scoop the pulp from the skin, leaving a 1/2" shell. Force  the pulp through a ricer into a bowl .  Add the unsalted butter, the cream  and salt and pepper to taste.   Beat the mixture until fluffy. Stir in the  salmon.  Mound the filling into the potato shells.

Bake the potatoes on a baking sheet in a preheated 425? for 10 - 15 minutes  (if they are freshly made) or 20 - 30 minutes (if they have been  refrigerated).
