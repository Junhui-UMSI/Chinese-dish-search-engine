From: John Rodakowski <whyme@u.washington.edu>    Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 22:35:36 -0700 (PDT)  Sift together the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt.  Cut in the  butter until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs.  Add sugar, caraway  seed and mix thouroughly. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg  and mix slowly. Pour in sufficient milk to bind it all together to make a  stiff dropping consistency. Pour into a greased and floured cake or loaf  pan. Bake at 375 for 30 min.          Ive only made the first recipe, and cant vouch for the second. With  the first, Ive made it with only half the butter, and it turned out fine,  not as rich though.
