Valerie- here is a light little dessert from "Chiles" by W. Park Kerr its  called Pineapple Sorbet w/ Serranos and Purple Basil: Youll need 1 1/2  cups water, 1 cup + 2 tbs sugar, 3 fresh serranos cut into thin rounds, 5  med. springs of purple basil (or sweet), 1 med. pineapple, peeled,cored,  and cut into 1 inch chunks, and 1/4 fresh lime juice.    combine water, sugar and serranos in a small sauce pan. Bring to a simmer  over med. heat, stir to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat, stir in basil,  let stand, covered until cool. Strain the syrup and toss basil and  serranos.    In a food processor, combine pineapple and lime juice and process until  smooth. Add puree to serrano syrup, cover and refridge until very cold (at  least 5 hours). Transfer mixture to an ice cream maker and churn. Cover and  freeze. You can make this up to two days ahead of time.    Glens note: Dont know the exact amount of lime juice, recipe called for  "1/4 fresh lime juice", so dont know if it is juice of 1/4 fresh lime, or  maybe      1/4    cup fresh lime juice??????
