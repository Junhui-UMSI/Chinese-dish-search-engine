Select fresh tender beets and cut off the tops and roots. Wash the  beets, without removing the skins, and boil in a large pot with ample  water.  Meanwhile, clean the beet greens with the stems; add to the pot  after the beets have cooked 30 min.  When beets are tender, remove and  strain the liquid.  Peel the beets and cut them into round slices; chop up  the greens. Mound greens in center of a platter and surround them with the  beet slices.  Pour oil and vinegar over all, and serve. or serve with  Skordalia (garlic) Sauce. Serve hot or cold.       SKORDALIA SAUCE:  Clean garlic and mash it completely (you may use food  processor).  Mash in potatoes, one by one, until you have a thick paste  (the more potatoes you use, the more sauce you get--but less potent).  Alternately add the oil and vinegar, beating constantly. If the sauce is  too thick for your taste, add a little water or fish or chicken stock. NO  LUMPS IN THIS SAUCE, P-L-E-A-S-E !!       NOTE:  Many people like to add almonds or walnuts to skordalia. These  are mashed to a pulp and added to the paste before the potatoes, oil, and  vinegar.
