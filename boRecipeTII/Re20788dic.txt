Stir in orange juice gradually, mixing with wooden  spoon, until dough cleans the bowl.  Use only as much orange juice as  needed. Cover, chill for 1 hour. Roll out 2/3 of dough on a floured board  into a 10 inch square. Place into a greased 8-inch pan so the dough comes  up around the sides of the pan.    Combine the filling ingredients; spread evenly on the crust. Roll out the  remaining piece of dough into a 9-inch square and put over filling. Moisten  edges around the pan, and press both sides together to seal.  Prick top of  crust with a fork. (My mother always brushed the top with a beaten egg  mixes with water and then sprinkled top with a cinnamon-sugar mix. I omit  that) Bake in a preheated hot oven - 400f- for 35 to 40 minutes or until  brown. Cut into squares and serve warm.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 311    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
