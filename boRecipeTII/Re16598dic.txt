Potatoes-boiled; peeled, Pine nuts, Egg, olive oil, Cloves garlic; peeled, Juice of a lemon, 
"Combine the garlic and the nuts in a blender or food processor and  puree.Add the potatoes, and puree. Pour potato mixture into a bowl and,  using a wisk, beat in the lemon juice, a bit at a time. Gradually add the  olive oil in a thin stream while continuing to beat so oil combines with  potato mixture. When oil has been absorbed, add the egg and beat well.  Giovanni de Bourbon- Sicily, French Vogue Note: If you omit the raw egg,  you still get a nice sauce."    This came from a lady who uses this sauce for pommes frites she eats in  Amsterdam.
