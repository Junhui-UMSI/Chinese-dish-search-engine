Quickest Puff Pastry
water, Unbleached, all-purpose flour, Salt, unsalted butter, 
Cut 8 ounces butter into 1/2 to 1/4-inch dice, place on a plate and  refrigerate while preparing remaining ingredients.    Measure water and add salt; stir to dissolve and set aside.    Coarsely dice remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Place flour in work bowl of  food processor fitted with metal blade; add 4 tablespoons butter and pulse  until butter is absorbed - about ten to twelve 1-second pulses. Add  remaining butter and pulse one or twice to distribute. Add water and pulse  3 or 4 times, just until dough forms a rough ball - do not over process.    Flour work surface and scrape dough from work bowl. Shape dough into a  rough rectangle and place between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Press dough  with rolling pin to flatten, then roll back and forth several times with  rolling pin to make a 12 by 18-inch rectangle of dough. Peel away plastic  wrap and invert dough to floured work surface. Peel away second piece of  wrap. Fold dough in thirds in the width, folding the top third down and the  bottom third up, to make a 6 by 18-inch rectangle, then roll up the dough  from one of the 6-inch ends, making sure to roll end under dough. Press the  dough into a square, wrap in plastic and refrigerate 1 hour, or until firm.    Yield: 1 1/2 pounds of dough    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8988    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #902 by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Nov 12, 1997
