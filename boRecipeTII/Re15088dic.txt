Caprial Pence, co-owner and chef at Westmoreland Bistro, included the  recipe for this special holiday dessert in her latest cookbook, "Caprials  Cafe". This will be a nice change from pumpkin pie for Christmas.    In a heavy saucepan over medium temperature, heat the pumpkin puree, cream  and vanilla bean halves to a boil and set aside.    Place the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium stainless steel  bowl (or the top of a double boiler) and place the bowl over a pot of  barely simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture forms a ribbon  when you lift the whisk, about 6 or 8 minutes. Be careful not to scramble  the egg mixture.    Slowly whisk in hot pumpkin mixture to the egg mixture and stirring  frequently, cook over medium heat until the mixture has the consistency of  softly whipped cream, 40 to 50 minutes. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice  and ginger and mix well. Pour into 6 custard cups and refrigerate for 3  hours or overnight.    When ready to serve, sprinkle each custard with 4 teaspoons sugar and place  under a preheated broiler for 2 or 3 minutes or until sugar is browned.  Serve immediately.    Makes 6 servings    Source: Chef Caprial Pence, Westmoreland Bistro as printed in the Oregonian  FoodDay 1995    Typos by Dorothy Flatman  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #196    Date: Fri, 12 Jul 1996 21:42:46 -0500    From: pickell@cyberspc.mb.ca (S.Pickell)
