Another Hummus
Garbanzo beans, Fat free yogurt, Lemon juice, Garlic, Coriander, Sesame Oil, 
Note:  Oil must be TOASTED SESAME OIL (I  found in Asian food section of HFS.Very strong flavor, a bottle should last  for years)      Mash garbanzos (I mash with a potato masher, then run in batches in  blender, because I like my hummus smooth)  Mix in everything else, tasting  as you go along.  Salt can be added, if you like. I also add some red  pepper on the top before serving. Chilling seems to mix the flavors. Serve  with pita wedges.    With the sesame oil you really get the taste without all the fat. Play  around with it.  I have never tasted hummus that was the same, it all  varies depending on who makes it!  Oh yes, cucumber goes well with this (on  top of pita wedge).    Enjoy!   Tyrrell in Texas
