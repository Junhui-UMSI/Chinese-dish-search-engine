Mash cooked 7 Bean & Barley.  Mix tomato paste with water.  In skillet,  saute onion in oil and combine all Group I ingredients. Let these cook  over medium heat; if the beans were hot to begin with, no more than five  minutes cooking is needed.  Stir constantly to prevent sticking.    Adjust seasonings to taste.  Combine the ingredients of Group II except  for cheese in a heavy pan, and cook over medium heat until cornmeal  thickens and comes to a boil, stirring constantly.  Oil a 8" x 8" pan and  spread 2/3 of the cornmeal mixture over the bottom and sides.  Pour the  bean mixture into the cornmeal crust and spread rest of cornmeal mix on  top.    Sprinkle the top crust with grated cheese and cook in a 350 F. oven for 30  minutes or until golden brown.
