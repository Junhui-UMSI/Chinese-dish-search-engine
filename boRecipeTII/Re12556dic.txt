Saute the onions, garlic, berbere, and paprika in the niter kebbeh  for 2 minutes.  Add the beans, carrots, and potatoes and continue to  saute for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.  Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock.  Bring  to a boil and then simmer for 15 minutes, or until all of the  vegetables are tender. [personal comment: we simmered more like 40  minutes, until it eventually thickened.]    Add salt and pepper to taste.  Mix in the parsley (optional).    Serve with injera and yogurt or cottage cheese.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/ethiopia.zip
