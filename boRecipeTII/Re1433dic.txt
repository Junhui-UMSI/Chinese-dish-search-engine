Someone was asking about recipes with Tofu. Heres a couple of good ones  from Chile Pepper Magazines "Hot, Spicy & Meatless" cookbook.    Place a double layer of paper towels in colander. Place the tofu cubes on  the towels to drain for at least 25 minutes. Combine the vegetable broth  and cornstarch in a bowl until the cornstarch is dissolved. Whisk in the  chile paste, brown sugar, soy sauce and peanut oil, set the mixture aside.    Heat two tablespoons of the safflower oil in a wok or a large pan over high  heat. Add the tofu and stir fry until it is light brown. Remove the tofu  and place on a plate4 using a slotted spoon. Put the rest of the oil in the  wok and continue to heat on high. Add the mushrooms first and stir-fry for  about 5 minutes. Next add the rest of the ingredients, including the tofu  and stir-fry for about 1 minute. Last, stir the broth-cornstarch mixture  into t he wok and bring to a boil. Divide the rice onto plates and top with  stir fry.    Serves 4.
