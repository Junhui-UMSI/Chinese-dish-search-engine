Cover,  set control and cook for 5 minutes after control jiggles.  Reduce pressure  instantly.  For a heavier consistency, this mixture may be thickend by  cooking uncovered with mixture of flour and water, stirring constantly.    NOTE: This is exactly as the recipe came across -- one amount makes 4  quarts, but exactly double that amount makes only 6 quarts!?!?! -- Glen.
