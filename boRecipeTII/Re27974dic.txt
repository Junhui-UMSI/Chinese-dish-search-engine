(April 1996 Gourmet)    Preheat oven to 350. Make crust: In a bowl, stir together crust  ingredients. Sprinkle the crumbs into a 9 inch springform pan and press  evenly over bottom and up the sides about 1 1/2 inches. Make filling: with  an electric mixer beat cream cheese until fluffy and add eggs a little at a  time. Beat in vanilla and sugar until just combined. Pour filling into  crust and bake in the middle of the oven for 45 min. Transfer cake to a  rack and let stand 5 min. Leave oven on. Make topping: stir together  topping ingredients. Gently spread over top of cake and return to oven.  Bake cake for 10 min. Remove from oven and let cool completely. Cover with  plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Remove cake from refrigerator and  let stand at room temperature 30 min. Serve with strawberries if desired.    *) I used yogurt cheese made from fatfree yogurt and left to drain for 36  hours.    **) I used lf sour cream.
