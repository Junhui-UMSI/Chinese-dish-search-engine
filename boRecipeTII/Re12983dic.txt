Sweet pineapple is enlivened by fresh, crisp cucumber spiced up with  garlic, chilies and tangy lime juice. The heat of the chili is in the  seeds and ribs, so remove them before mincing (wear rubber gloves).    1. Combine diced pineapple, cucumber and onion in a bowl. Mix gently.    2. Toss in minced chili, garlic, lime zest and lime juice. Cover and  refrigerate up to 2 hours before use.    3. Add basil and cilantro just before serving. Serve chilled.    Yield: 2 cups.
