Wash corn in stock.  Drain corn, reserving stock; chop  finely and return to stock.  In a cup, mix cornstarch  and cold stock to make paste.    In heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat oil until hot.  Saute  green onions & ginger for about 30 seconds, stirring  constantly to avoid burning. Add stock & corn; stir &  bring to just under boil. Add salt, pepper & sugar.  Simmer 15 minutes or until ready to serve. Just before  serving, turn up heat again to a bubbly boil. Dribble  in cornstarch paste until soup acquires a waxy  translucence.  It should still be thin, but not  watery. Add sherry. Now beat egg white with a fork to  a light froth. Turn off heat. Quickly swirl in egg  whites. Pour into serving bowl. Garnish with ham.  Serve.
