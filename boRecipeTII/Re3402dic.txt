Pecan Balls
Finely chopped pecans, Sugar, Flour, Salt, Vanilla, Real butter; softened, not, 
Mix everything together, and knead to make a large ball. Roll pieces of the  dough between your hands to make small balls. Place about aninch totwo  inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 for about 15 to 20  minutes. Remove from oven, and while hot coat with about 1cup of powdered  sugar. Set aside, allowto cool. Coat in powdered sugar again. Make sure to  store these in an air-tight container ... moisture causes them to mush  ..Makes about 20 balls.    NOTES: The trick to making these wonderful, Is to chopthe pecans VERYsmall.  Iusually buy the cookie pecan pieces at the store, andthen chopthemeven  more in a food processor.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Winkie2421 <Winkie2421@AOL.COM> on Dec 6, 1997
