Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Coat baking sheet with non-stick spray or  parchment.  In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, anise seeds, baking  powder, baking soda, and salt.  Whisk together egg equivalents, lemon zest,  and lemon juice, and add to the dry ingredients. Mix well. Working on a  floured surface, shape dough into two logs, each about 14 inches long and  1-1/2 inches thick.  Set the logs on prepared baking sheet, at least 4  inches apart (the dough will spread during baking). Bake for 20 to 25  minutes, until firm to the touch. Transfer the logs to the rack to cool.  Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F. Cut the logs diagonally into  1/2-inch-thick slices, using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion.  Stand the slices on their sides on the baking sheet and return to the oven.  Bake for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing.  Biscotti will crisp as they cool.  Store, in an air-tight container, up to  one month.    Makes about 4 dozen biscotti.    note: I made 43 cookies, about 40 cal, < 1 g fat each, but it depends on  what you use for the "egg"    > From: Christina Hulbe <chulbe@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>.
