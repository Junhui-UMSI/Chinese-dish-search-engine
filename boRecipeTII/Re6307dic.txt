Plainest Italian Sausage
Salt, Foot of sausage casing,, Boneless pork, Black Pepper, Fennel seeds, Dry Red Wine, Fresh pork fat, 
SCRAPE THE LOOSE SALT OFF the sausage casing and set the casing in a bowl  of cold water to soften for at least 30 minutes. (You will need only about  4 feet of casing for this amount of meat, but its useful to have extra in  case of ruptures.) Cut the pork and fat into pieces that will go through  your meat grinder and grind them, using the coarse blade. Mix the salt,  pepper and fennel seeds thoroughly into the ground meat. (Hands are the  best implement.) Then mix in the wine. Drain the casing, open one end  gently with your fingers and run a stream of cold water into it, to flush  any remaining salt out of the interior. Thread the casing onto the stuffing  horn and fit the horn over the meat grinder. Feed the sausage meat through  the horn, supporting the emerging tube of sausage with your hands to  prevent rips. (Actually, sausage making is much more conveniently done with  two people.) When all the sausage meat is in the casing, lay the filled  tube on the work surface and pinch it at 4-inch intervals to produce  individual sausage links. At the same time, fill and firm any air pockets  in the casing. Tie off the links with kitchen string. Coil the sausages  onto a plate and set it, uncovered, in the refrigerator to season for 48  hours. Turn the sausages over once or twice during that time.
