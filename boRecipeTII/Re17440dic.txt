Walnut Sauce
Whole wheat flour, Vegetable stock, Liquid aminos, Walnuts; raw, Black pepper, Garlic cloves, crushed, Lemon juice, 
Put the flour in a small dry frying pan over medium heat and toast,  stirring often, until it has darkened evenly to a light brown. Transfer the  flour to a blender. Add the walnuts, liquid aminos, lemon juice,garlic,  pepper, and 1/2 cup of the vegetable bouillon to the blender and blend  until smooth. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of the bouillon and blend until  smooth. Scrape the mixture into a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over  low heat, and simmer, stirring often, until the mixture is thickened, about  2 minutes. Serve hot. This was developed especially for the zucchini boats,  but is also good over brown rice, potatoes and vegetables.
