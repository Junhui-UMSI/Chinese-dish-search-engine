Cream the butter and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the  eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. Sift the flour,  baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger together  twice. Add the sifted flour and spices to the egg mixture, then add the  buttermilk and mix well. Add the pureed pumpkin and the chopped pecans and  blend thoroughly, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure  proper mixing.  Divide the batter equally between two buttered and floured  layer-cake pans and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately  25 minutes, or until a tester inserted through the center comes out clean.  Cool the layers for 10 minutes. Remove them from the pans and place them in  the refrigerator for 45 minutes, or until cold. Whip the cream, vanilla  extract and confectioners sugar together until peaks form. Place first  layer of cake on cake platter, cover with half of the whipped cream. Place  other cake layer on top and finish frosting cake with remaining whipped  cream. Submitted By RHOMMEL <RHOMMEL@IX.NETCOM.COM> On SAT, 25 NOV 1995   164645    ~0500
