1)  Using a sharp vegetable peeler, cut away the zest of the lemon in  strips, taking care not to include any of the bitter white pith. On a  cutting board finely chop the zest with the parsley and garlic. 2) Place  the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover them by 1  inch.  Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to moderately high  and cook the potatoes until tender, approximately 15 minutes. 3) Drain the  potatoes in a colander and return them to the sauce pan. Using a potato  masher, mash potatoes over a very low heat, gradually incorporating the  heavy cream and the butter.  Stir in the salt and the gremolada and serve  immediately.
