Bacon Cheese Bread
Real bacon bits (I used, Water, Yeast, Salt, Butter (I used margerine), Grated sharp Cheddar cheese, Bread flour, 
Place ingredients in the bread maker according to the directions of the  manufacturer. Start machine.    Personal notes: With my Panasonic, I put in the dry ingredients, then the  wet, and I have a separate dispenser for the yeast. I selected sandwich  mode, which would be light crust.    I found this recipe last week while "surfing." I mailed it to myself, but  from what I have printed out, it came from recipes@soar.berkeley.edu. This  goes into my notebook of "keepers."
