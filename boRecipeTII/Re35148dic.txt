Bring to a boil, and simmer 20 minutes or until the gizzards are  done. Drain the gizzards, reserving the broth, and chop them into  bite-sized pieces. Skim the broth.    Make a light roux of the flour and butter, then add the garlic. Bring the  reserved broth back to a boil, then pour about a cup of the boiling broth  into the roux, stirring constantly. When the mixture thickens, gradually  pour in enough of the broth to make a cream-soup consistency, stirring  constantly. Return the gizzard pieces to the stew, and heat a few minutes.  Serve with challah.
