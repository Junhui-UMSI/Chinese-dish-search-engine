Melt choc chips in a double boiler over low heat or in microwave (if you  know what youre doing).  Put tofu, sweetener, and melted chocolate into a  blender and process until very smooth. Pour into a serving bowl or bowls  and refrigerate, covered, for at least a couple of hours. Cover this well,  because it will pick up EVERY odor in your refrigerator otherwise...    Note: if your budget allows, use a really good vegan chocolate bar (like  Rapunzel Organic Bittersweet) instead of some or all of the chips.  Enjoy!
