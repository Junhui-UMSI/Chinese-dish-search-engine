Basic Tomato Sauce (Tomato Leather)
Margarine, Salt, Onion, chopped very fine, Garlic, Tomato paste, Sugar, Black pepper, olive oil, Basil, Oregano, Parsley, chopped, 
Saute the onion and garlic together in the fat until they are soft and  golden, stop before they begin to brown. Add the rest of the ingredients  and cook slowly for about 10 minutes.    Spray a cookie sheet or other flat pan with a nonstick spray. Spread the  mixture out in as thin a layer as possible - use two pans if necessary. Dry  the sauce in the oven at 140 degrees F for about 6 hours with the door  propped open a crack.  Do not overdry or the reconstituted sauce will taste  burned.  Roll it up like fruit leather, and put into a plastic bag labled  "Tomato Sauce." To reconstitute, add triple the amount of water to the  dried sauce, bring to a boil, and simmer five minutes. Will feed six with  pasta.
