Recently I picked up a boxed salad at a healthfood store. They write all  the ingredients on the box top--it was so good I made one up. Sorry no  proportions, but it isnt difficult to put together.    You could omit any or add your own vegie choices.    I made up a dressing that was more clear looking than mayo. looking. I used  from their ingredient list the following: Umeboshi vinegar, brown rice  vinegar, lemon and a little nayonaise (the fatfree one).
