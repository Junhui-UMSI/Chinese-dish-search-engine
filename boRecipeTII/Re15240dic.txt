Whiskey Balls
Vanilla wafer crumbs, pecans, Salt, Unsweetened cocoa, Bourbon, Light corn syrup, 
1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioners      sugar, Bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt. Form into small      balls the size of walnuts.    2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioners sugar and      place on a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several      hours or overnight.    Note:  It is traditional in the South to use Bourbon, but rye may         also be used. This confection -- or at least a version of it -- was  an early Southern version of those chocolate truffles that became the rage  for chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this country. The whiskey balls  are made, of course, with cocoa rather than chocolate.    ~From Craig Claibornes "Southern Cooking"    ~Lovingly hacked in for the FIDO Cooking Echo by Wesley Pitts, the Bourbon  Cowboy.
