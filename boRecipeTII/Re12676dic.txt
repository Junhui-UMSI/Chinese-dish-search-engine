From: cazeved1@cc.swarthmore.edu (Celina R. Azevedo)    Date: Mon, 11 Oct 1993 18:07:12 GMT  I am posting in response to the request for gingerbread recipes.  This is a  really scrumptious recipe my mother got out of a ladies aid society type  cookbook from the 1960s.  The yogurt glaze is what makes it--strange but  true.    NOTE: this would probably be great with freshly grated ginger, too, but Im  not sure what the equivalent amount would be.    Preheat the oven to 325.  Beat the butter with the sugar until light and  fluffy.  Add the eggs and the molasses.  Sift the dry ingredients together,  then add them to the butter-sugar mixture alternately with the boiling  water. Mix just until smooth. Pour into a greased 9x9 inch baking dish and  bake for       40    minutes. Meanwhile, make:    GLAZE: Mix all the ingredients in a saucepan and boil for 1 minute. If  youre squeamish about the whole cloves, take them out after boiling.  As  soon as the gingerbread comes out of the oven, prick it all over with a  toothpick and pour the glaze on. Allow it to set for several hours.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CAKES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
