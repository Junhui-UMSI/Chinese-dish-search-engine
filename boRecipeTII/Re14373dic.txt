Whole Wheat Bagel Bread
Gluten, Whole wheat flour, Active dry yeast, Salt, Warm water, 1 1/2 pound loaf:, Honey, 
If you dont like making bagels but want the texture of bagels with the  low-fat nutritional benefits; try this bread. It tastes like a bagel and is  especially good sliced and toasted.    There is one note for the Panasonic/National machines and that is to use 3  tsp yeast for 1 1/2 lb loaf. I believe that this is for the older  Panasonics as I do remember Linda Rehberg saying that the newer models came  out after their book was published and that the yeast amounts in her book  were not for the newer Panasonics. Upon re-reading I found I missed one  thing. I did add a few more tsps of water as the dough ball was not forming  to my liking.  Let me know if you make this and how you like it.    1437    *Total calories	54    *Total protein		 7    *Total fat	 1 *Total  saturated fat  	4269    *Total sodium		45    *Total fibre 4 *Calories from  fat	313    *Total carbohydrates  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Heather <HS.Roch811sd@xerox.com>
