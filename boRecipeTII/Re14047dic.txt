White Chocolate Mousse
White chocolate, Heavy whipping cream, Hot water, Vanilla, Brandy, Sugar, Eggs, 
White chocolate is not actually chocolate at all, but cocoa butter with the  chocolate liquor left out. This dessert was originally concieved as a dark  chocolate mousse by Chef Andrea Apuzzo of Andreas Restaurant in Metairie,  Louisiana, when he was executive chef at the Royal Orleans Hotel before  opening Andreas. It is served piped into a chocolate cup, which is then  placed in a pool of raspberry sauce.    Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. Its a good idea to  stand over the chocolate while it is melting and stir it until its  completely melted, then take it off the heat immediately.    Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the brandy and hot water slowly into a  bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go until completely mixed.    Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is  completely combined; this will help to cool the chocolate. Whip the egg  whites and the sugar until peaking but not dry; add the vanilla to the egg  whites and sugar as you beat them.    Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with a  wooden spoon.    Fold in the whipped cream. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE RECIPE. The  key to a great chocolate mousse is that you cant incorporate hot melted  chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate mixture must be cool to the  touch or the cream will break. Lightly blend the two mixtures until  uniform.  Walt MM  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V3 #260    Date: Sun, 22 Sep 1996 22:08:59 -0400    From: Walt Gray <waltgray@mnsinc.com>
