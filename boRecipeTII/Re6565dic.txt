Trim roots from leeks, leaving bases intact so leeks do not seperate into  layers when cut. Halve leeks lengthwise; wash thoroughly under running  water. Place 2 1/2 quarts water, wine, lemon juice, salt, peppercorns,  oregano and leeks in a large shallow saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat  to medium low; simmer until very flavorful, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile,  slice into one long side of each salmon fillet about 3/4 of the way  through, forming a pocket. Trim tough bottoms from asparagus; cut each  spear in half. Arrange ten asparagus halves in the pocket of each salmon  fillet (parallel to the cut side) in two rows of five, facing tips toward  center. Press gently to close. Tie kitchen string around salmon in two  places, so pocket stays closed while poaching. Return stock to a boil.  Reduce heat so stock is at a bare simmer. Add salmon and poach, adjusting  heat to maintain a bare simmer, for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer salmon from  stockpot to a glass or ceramic baking dish. Allow liquid to cool for 5  minutes, then pour over salmon; let stand until cool, about 1 hour. Remove  salmon from liquid; let stand to come toroom temperature, about 45 minutes.  Untie salmon and slice each fillet widthwise into 1-inch pieces; garnish  with dill sprigs and serve Kohlrabi Slaw on the side.
