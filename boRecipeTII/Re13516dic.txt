* The Latin name for pansies is Viola x wittrockiana, only use in amount  specified "This colourful starter makes a great supper or lunch dish served  with new green peas or a leafy salad. Its bright colours make it appealing  to both adults and children and it easy to make." First make the flan case;  sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and tip in the bran remaining in  the sieve. Chop the margarine into the flour with a knife, then gently rub  in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Lift  your fingers above the bowl as you rub to keep the mixture light or aerated  (Annes note: I would use a food processor). Add the iced water and mix  with a knife until you have a firm dough. Lift out the dough, wrap in cling  film (Saran) and chill in the fridge for 5-10 minutes. Heat the oven to  350F/180 C/gas 4. On a lightly floured marble or wooden surface, roll out  the dough thinly into a circle large enough to line a 8-0/20-24 cm flan  dish. Grease the dish and line it with the dough. Set aside. To make the  filling, heat the butter and oil in a shallow pan, put in the onions and  peppers and sweat (cook) gently until the vegetables are soft but not  coloured. Add the pansies. Whisk the eggs and stir in the grated cheese and  milk. Season to taste. Pour the onion and pepper mixture into the egg  mixture and stir well. Pour into the prepared flan case. Bake in the oven  for 25-30 minutes., rising the heat a little if necessary, until the  filling is nicely puffed up and the pastry is beginning to brown. Serve hot  or cold.
