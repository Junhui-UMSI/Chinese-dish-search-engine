Either cook frozen corn as directed on the package OR select tender corn on  the cob and boil for about 20 minutes in lightly salted water. Drain and  cool, then scrape kernels from the cob. May need to cook again in enough  water to cover corn until tender.    Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, stir, reduce  heat, and simmer until frothy. Add milk, stirring slowly until sauce is  creamy in consistency.    Add corn, salt, paprika, black pepper, sugar, and eggs. Remove from heat  and pour into a greased, oven-proof baking dish. Sprinkle capsicum, bread  crumbs, and another dash of paprika on top.    Place casserole in a shallow pan of hot water and bake in a pre-heated 350  to 375-F degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes. May be broiled for 2-3 minutes  to crisp up the top just prior to serving.
