Rebekahs Pineapple Salad
FIRST LAYER, (16 oz) crushed pineapple, Lemon juice, (8 oz) softened cream cheese, Flour, Box (3 oz) lemon jello, SECOND LAYER, Shredded sharp cheddar, THIRD LAYER, Sugar, Pineapple juice, Beaten egg yolks, FOURTH LAYER, Envelope dream whip, 
First Layer: Mix jello according to package directions. Add well-drained  pineapple. Pour into 9x13 dish. Chill until set.    Second layer: Prepare dream whip according to package directions. Add cream  cheese, and blend well. Spread over first layer; refrigerate.    Third layer: Mix all ingredients in saucepan. Cook over medium heat until  thick and bubbly. Cool, then spread over second layer.    Fourth layer: Sprinkle evenly over the third layer. Cover entire salad, and  refrigerate.    Note: This fits the oblong corning ware dish perfectly...you know, the one  we make lasagna in. I think its not quite 9x13, but it works.    This is a whole lot easier than it looks!!!!!! This is our standard "Easter  Dinner" recipe.....  Posted to EAT-L Digest 26 Jan 97 by "Sharon H. Frye" <shfrye@PEN.K12.VA.US>  on Jan 26, 1997.
