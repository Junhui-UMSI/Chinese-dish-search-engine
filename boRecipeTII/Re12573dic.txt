Yogurt #1
milk, Yogurt saved from a previous, (3-oz) yogurt culture; -or-, 
Heat milk to boiling point. DO NOT BOIL. Cool milk to about 110 degrees  (just warm to the touch.) Put dried yogurt or yogurt saved from a previous  batch into a cup & add a little of the warm milk. Mix well & add rest of  milk & stir. Pour into clean, dry glass jars. Put lids on but do not seal.  (Use jars that hold about 1 cup.) Place in a warm place. Let incubate 3-5  hours. It is ready when set like jelly. Tighten lids. Dont seal. Keep in  refrigerator. Let cool before eating. Keeps about 2 weeks. Save some for  next batch. (Any milk may be used, i.e. skimmed, goat, soya, even canned. I  use my oven with a gas pilot light for making the yogurt. An electric oven  may be used by heating to about 110 degrees then turning it off. Check from  time to time to see if it needs warming. Set jars on towel in electric  oven. Direct heat kills culture.)    JANE ANN COPELAND    From <Simply Southern>, the Desoto School Mothers Assn, Helena-West  Helena, AR 72390.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
