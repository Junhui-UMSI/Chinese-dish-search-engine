Lynns notes: Made this 1-7-97; added 1 medium chopped onion  and 1 medium chopped green bell pepper to the meat as it cooked. I made the  recipe into 4 individual servings by cutting and pasting the dough together  with a little water. This was an easy recipe to do, looked great and tasted  wonderful!
