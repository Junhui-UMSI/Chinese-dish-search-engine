Bake-And-Take Peach Coffeecake
peaches, Sugar, Milk, Flour, Flour, Baking Powder, Eggs, Butter or margarine, Sugar, TOPPING, Butter or margarine, 
Mix together flour, sugar, eggs, baking powder, butter and milk with hands  to make a smooth dough. If dough does not stick together, add 1-3  tablespoons more milk. Put three quarters of the dough mixture into a  greased 12x18 inch edged cookie sheet or jelly roll pan. Roll with rolling  pin or press with hands to cover entire pan including edges. Cover dough  with peaches and sprinkle with a little sugar.    To make topping, combine flour, butter and sugar into a crumb mixture.  Sprinkle over dough. Roll rest of dough into strips and cover peaches with  a lattice top. (I have put the crumbs on the peaches and also the strips  over the peaches and then the crumbs. I also added a little almond  flavoring to the peaches.) Bake at 350 for 40-50 minutes.    Recipe by: Quick n Easy June 1997 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #644 by  L979@aol.com on Jun 12, 1997
