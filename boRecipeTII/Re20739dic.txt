Apple Dessert
(21-oz) apple pie filling, Pecans, Yellow cake mix, Water, 
Put apple pie filling in a large 13-inch pie dish. Pour the water on  apples. Sift the cake mix over the entire pie. Melt butter & pour over all.  Cover with chopped pecans. Bake at 350 for 1 hour. (You may use any type  pie filling you wish & substitute a white cake mix.) (Testers note: I  added 1/2 cup brown sugar & 2 teaspoons cinnamon on top of pie filling &  served warm with ice cream.)
