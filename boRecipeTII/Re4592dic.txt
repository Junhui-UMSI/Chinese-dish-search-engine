Drain baccala and pat dry, checking for bones but leaving intact any skin  pieces. Cut baccala into 3-inch by 1-inch pieces and set aside. In a medium  mixing bowl, whisk together flour, water, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt  and two tablespoons virgin olive oil until very smooth.    In a 6-inch deep frying pan, heat 1 quart oil to 370 degrees.    Dip baccala into batter and drop into oil, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, and fry  until golden brown on all sides, about 6 to 7 minutes. Remove and drain on  paper towels. While pieces are frying, quarter 3 lemons and remove the  seeds. Chop roughly and place in food processor with remaining 1/2 cup of  olive oil, teaspoon of salt, sugar and pepper and blend until smooth and  thick. Pour lemon pesto into serving bowl. When all baccala is cooked,  serve immediately with lemon wedges and lemon pesto dipping sauce.
