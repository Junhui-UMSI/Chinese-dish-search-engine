Piedmont Garlic Dip
Anchovy Fillets, Preferably, Garlic, Finely Sliced, Black Pepper, olive oil, Butter, 
Melt butter and olive oil together in a pan and add garlic. Chop up  anchovies and add to pan. Cook over a low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes,  stirring it occasionally so you end up with a wonderfully fishy, garlicky  sauce. Season to taste.
