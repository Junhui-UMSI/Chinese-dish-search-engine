Cheese-Topped Cauliflower
Cauliflower, Salt, Mayonnaise, Cheddar Cheese; grated, Prepared mustard, Fresh Herbs or 2 cups Cooked, 
The Cook & Kitchen Staff are offering you four different Thanksgiving Day  Dinner menus during November, and were now in the middle of the side  dishes for our final recipe collection, featuring a "Thanksgiving Day  Dinner on the Farm."    Fresh cauliflower is naturally abundant this time of the year, as its  harvest peaks during October and November. Given that youre celebrating a  day of thanks historically rooted in the fall harvest, this member of the  cabbage family makes for a perfect addition to your holiday feast.    In a large pot over a high-heat setting, place the rinsed and cleaned whole  head of cauliflower in just enough lightly salted water to cover the head.    Bring the water to a boil and reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook  until just tender, about 20 to 30 minutes. Do not overcook. Its fine for  the florets to be a bit firm, as the vegetable will continue to cook for  several minutes after its lifted from the boiling water. Remove from heat  and drain well.    Place the cauliflower in a shallow baking dish. In a small bowl, combine  the salt, mayonnaise, mustard, and cheese. Spread the mixture over the top  of the cauliflower and bake at 325-F degrees for about 20 minutes, or until  the cheese is melted, but not yet browned.    Carefully remove the cauliflower from the baking dish and place whole on a  serving platter surrounded by fresh herbs or a ring of fresh green peas, if  so desired.
