Source: My mother, Marcelle Farhi    In a food processor, combine the meat, onions, salt and bhar, process until  smooth.    Wash burghul well in running water, do this quickly so it wont soften.  Press well to remove water, until the burghul is almost dry.    Knead burghul and meat with the hands. Add salt to taste. Process once  again.    Stuffing: Heat oil. Sautee chopped onions until soft. Add meat and fry  until lightly brown, stirring always. Cover with water and let cook till  the water dries. When the meat is cooked, season with salt and bhar.    Form kibbeh into balls the size of a walnut. Smooth the meat ball with  fingers dipped in cold water. With the thumb, form a hole in the meatball  and work it with your index finger till it gets thin but dont break.  Another way would be with a grinder and a GOURMET.MATIC, amazing food  shaper. (SEE NOTE.) Fill it with a teaspoon of the meat stuffing, closing  the opening, and pat the meatball into an egg shape. Fry in hot oil. Serve  with tahine as a dip.    NOTE: The GOURMET.MATIC food shaper is made by GOGLANIAN ENTERPRISES at  1583 Monrovia Ave. Newport Beach.
