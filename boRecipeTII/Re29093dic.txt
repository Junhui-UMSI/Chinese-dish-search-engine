Per Serving: Cal 87 Fat 2 grams    FROM: First, March 1990 (magazine for women)    Section: Mediterranean Light    Heat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly spray a 2 quart baking dish. Cut off the  tops of the fennel but keep the feathery leaves for garnish. Cut fennel  into thin slices. Put in prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with seasonings and  toss with the oil. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake til almost  tender. Add thinly sliced potatoes to the fennel, add more seasoning if  desired. Cover and bake until potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve  hot or warm.    Notes: I havent made this yet, but I see no reason to cook in two steps.  My experience with cooking potatoes in the oven suggests that they will  take about the same time as the fennel. I will layer them, after tossing  both in the oil and seasonings, then cook them together. Ill let you know  when I do it.    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n174 by "Tina D.
