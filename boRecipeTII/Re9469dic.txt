Add  pumpkin, milk, eggs, and shortening.    Beat with an electric mixer on low speed till blended, then on high speed  for 2 minutes.  Add remaining flour, beat well.  Stir in nuts and raisins.  Pour batter into a greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.  Bake in a 350-degree oven  for 60 to 65 minutes or till a toothpick inserted near the center comes out  clean. Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Remove from the pan; cool  thoroughly on a wire rack. Wrap and store overnight before slicing [I  havent found the last two steps entirely necessary, since it is absolutely  delicious warm, and it holds its form even if you slice it before its  completely cooled].
