Preheat oven to 350. Place potatoes and garlic in a med saucepan; add water  tocover and cook until potatoes are tender--about 30 minutes. Remove  potatoes and garlic from liquid with a slotted spoon, saving the broth.  Peel the potatoes or not, as you prefer. Mash potatoes with a fork; remove  peel from garlic, mash and add to potatoes. Mix together "cream,"  coriander, nutmeg and pepper; combine with potato-garlic mixture. Cook  onion in 1/4 cup broth saved from cooking potatoes. When onion is tender,  place onion, onion broth and egg whites or whole egg in a blender or food  processor; process until onion is pureed. Mix onion with potato-garlic  mixture. Place this mixture in a lightly greased or nonstick 1-1/2 qt.  casserole. Bake for 30  min, or refrigerate at this point. If the potatoes  are prepared ahead and refrigerated, allow an extra 5 minutes of baking  time. Makes 4 servings. Note: I will post the recipe for the "cream" called  for in this recipe althugh the new no-fat sour cream substiture works well  here too. These potatoes may be assembled early the day they are to be  served and set aside for later baking.    Recipe By     :    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
