Turkey/ham Spread
green onion, ham, Mayonnaise, Worcestershire Sauce, turkey, carrot, sour cream, cream cheese, 
This was inspired by two recipes that were posted to the list in January:  Creamed Turkey Topping for Crackers posted by Janine Vandenberg and Dried  Beef Cheese Ball posted by Helen of Burlingame CA    I had printed both and was on my way to the supermarket, still unsure of  what I wanted to make. The recipes somehow conflated in y mind while I was  commuting, and out came the following: (I made some last night and my  housemates love it!)    Combine all ingredients. Ta Da! Serve with crackers or crostini.    I used reduced fat varieties of the sour cream, cream cheese and mayo. For  the turkey and ham, I bought "pieces and ends" from the deli department at  the supermarket. Theyre the end piece from the ham and turkey they slice  up, and are packaged and sold when they get too small to put in the slicer  without losing a finger. At my supermarket they sell for about $1 a pound.  Much more economical than canned meats and usually less sodium, too.
