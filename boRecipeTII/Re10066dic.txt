From: kapitan-white@sugar-land.oilfield.slb.com (Elsa Kapitan-White)    Date: Mon, 19 Aug 1996 15:13:49 -0500  In an (undated, from the 1980s) article from the New York Times, Marian  Burros wrote about Quark. She notes that although there are many  definitions of quark in food encyclopedias, the basic definition is a soft,  acid-cured cheese originally from Central Europe. It can be made with skim  or whole milk. Its often compared to cottage cheese, but "looks nothing  like American cottage cheese. It is probably closer to the farmer cheese  sold here, but even that is not an appropriate comparison. Quark has the  same sharpness characteristic of cottage cheese but is very creamy. And, it  has only half the calories of cream cheese, making it a good alternative in  recipes."    She provided the following cheesecake recipe (my comments in parentheses)      Crust: Thoroughly blend the ingredients and line the bootom of a 9-inch  springform pan.      Filling: Combine 1 1/2 lb (24 ounces) quark, eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla and beat in electric mixer at medium speed about 10 minutes, until mixture is light.  Spoon into the prepared pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 40 minutes.  Cool for  35 minutes.   Topping: While cooling, raise oven to 400 degrees and beat the remaining 16 ounces of quark and 6 tablespoons sugar together until light. Pour over the top of the cooled cake, and bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Cool and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Yield 14 to 16 servings.      I moved from College Station in 1990, so I dont know if the Texas A&M  "Meat Store" on West Campus still sells quark -- but it was delicious!    fatfree digest V96 #230    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
