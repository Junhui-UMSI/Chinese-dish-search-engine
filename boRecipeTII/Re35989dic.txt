Vinegar, Lean beef, Worcestershire Sauce, Tomato paste, Soy sauce, Sugar, Onion flakes, Salt, Garlic powder, 
Servings: 12    Trim all visible fat from the meat and freeze until firm and solid enough  to slice into thin strips. Cut across the grain and make sure that the  slices are as thin as you can make them, about 1/8 inch thick. Cut slices  into 1-inch- wide strips. Arrange strips in a shallow baking pan.    Combine remaining ingredients and pour liquid over strips. Refrigerate  overnight or for at least 8 hours.    Preheat oven to 140 degrees. Remove meat from the marinade and place the  strips on a cake rack over a cookie sheet in the oven. Dry until strips  will splinter on the edges--from 18-24 hours. Cool completely before  wrapping lightly with plastic wrap. Jerky will keep in a closely covered  container for 2 4 weeks.    OR...use your dehydrator according to manufacturers recommendations.
