Stuffed Butternut Pumpkin
Butternut pumpkin, 
Cut pumpkin in half lengthwise amd remove the seeds and stuff in the  middle., and cook in the microwave until almost soft. Then scoop out enough  of the pumpkin flesh to make a good big hole for stuffing. While the  pumpkin is cooking I peel and dice a few potatoes, chop an onion, and maybe  add a carrot as well. Cook these in the microwave until soft, remove and  mash, but dont totally pulverise them - a bit of texture is good. Now I  add some chopped mushrooms and frozen peas, and cook again. Add the pumpkin  flesh you removed earlier, then mix all together, adding a bit of skim milk  or substitute if it looks a bit dry. Pile into the pumpkin halves, and cook  again until it is all heated thru and the pumpkin is cooked.    I usually add a sprinkle of cheese on top (of course you would try to use  fat-free, but we cant get it here!!)    A few mild herbs added with the mushrooms is a nice addition (eg. rosemary,  thyme, something like that), but leave it out if you dont like it.  If I have some left over rice or cooked barley, that is nice too, plus just  abou t any other veges you have!!    I hope this makes sense - its a pretty vague recipe - I just put in what is  at hand, and it usually works out fine.
