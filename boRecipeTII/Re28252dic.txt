Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash the potatoes, prick them and bake for  about an hour or until done.

Meanwhile, heat olive oil and saute peppers and mushrooms until tender.  Remove from heat and stir in pesto, or other paste to taste and season with  salt and pepper.    When potatoes are done, split them almost all the way to the bottom and  squeeze up some of the potato flesh; spoon vegetable topping over and  around potatoes. If you did not add pesto or other paste, top with yogurt;  if you added pesto or other paste, top with shaved Parmesan.
