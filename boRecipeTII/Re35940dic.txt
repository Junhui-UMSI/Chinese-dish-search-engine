Stuffed Oysters
Egg, Parsley, Cooking oil, Onion, Saltine crackers, Celery, Salt and pepper to taste, Flour, Bell pepper, Eggs, oysters, Italian seasoned bread, 
Place cooking oil in a heavy saucepan; blend in flour. Cook over a low  temperature making a light roux (light brown). Add celery, onion, and bell  peppers; saute. Add oysters with their liquid; cook until oysters curl.  (You should have 2 cups liquid so add water if you do not have that much  oyster liquid.) Reduce heat to very low. Crumble crackers very fine and add  to oyster mixture along with slightly beaten egg. Remove from heat; add  parsley and chopped eggs. Season to taste. Place in individual oysters  shells or in a casserole dish. Top with bread crumbs and bakc in a 400  degree oven for 15 minutes. Serves 8. This may be prepared the day before  and refrigerated until time to place in oven before serving.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
