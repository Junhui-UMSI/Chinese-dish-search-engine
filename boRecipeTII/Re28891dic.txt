Dump the rest in, and cook on low for 4-6 hrs until the  chicken is fork tender.  Note:  If you like spicy food, use more than 2 T  red pepper flakes - to taste really. I like hot food, so Ive added up to 5  T. Season also with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve the chicken with  rice and veggies.    Save the stock for soup. If you prefer a creamier soup, you can add sour  cream to get the desired consistency, or if you like more authenticity, try  coconut milk.
