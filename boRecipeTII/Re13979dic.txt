In a Dutch oven, cook bacon over moderate heat until crisp. Add onion and  the diced potato; cook and stir until the onion softens. Add chicken broth,  the cabbage, carrot, wine, sugar and caraway seeds.    Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered, until vegetables  are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.    If you like a smoother soup, put half the batch in a blend; return all to  Dutch oven. Stir in half-and-half and simmer soup, uncovered, for about 15  minutes. Stir in dill, hot sauce, salt and pepper, to taste.    Posted By pgl@iglou.com (Don Thomas) On rec.food.recipes or  rec.food.cooking
