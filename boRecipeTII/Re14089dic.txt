From: Linda Place <placel@worldnet.att.net>    Date: Tue, 2 Jul 1996 00:52:18 GMT  Preheat oven to 350 F. In a medium bowl, combine the hazelnuts and  chocolate; mix well. Generously grease 2 heavy-gauge baking sheets with the  butter. Arrange 9 to 12 sue gow skins on each baking sheet, leaving  approximately 3/4-inch between each skin. Sprinkle about 21/2 ts of the  hazelnut-chocolate mixture on each skin. Bake 9 or 10 minutes, rotating the  pans from bottom to top and back to front, until the skins are light golden  brown on the edges (the chocolate will not melt). Remove from the oven and  cool skins on baking racks.  Prepare the remaining skins the same way and  bake until done. Cool to room temperature.    In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, white chocolate, sugar and  orange peel; mix well. Using approximately 1 tb per cookie, center the  ricotta mixture on the nut-chocolate side of the skins. Top each with  remaining skins, nut-chocolate side up. Serve on a large platter garnished  with mint sprigs or curled orange zest.    Note: Sue gow skins are thin, round wrappers used to make Asian dumplings,  dim sum, wontons etc. If you cannot find sue gow skins, substitute square  wonton wrappers, but avoid potsticker skins because they are too thick for  this recipe.
