Wild Rice with Mushrooms and Almonds
Chicken broth**, Uncooked wild rice*, Slivered almonds, (8 oz.) mushrooms, drained, Margarine or butter, Chives or green onions, 
Wash and drain rice. Melt butter in a large skillet. Add rice, almonds,  chives and mushrooms. Cook and stir until almonds are golden brown, about       20    minutes.    Heat oven to 325. Pour rice mixture into ungreased 1/1-2 quart casserole.  Heat chicken broth to boiling; stir into rice mixture. Cover tightly. Bake  about 1-1/2 hours or until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender and  fluffy. 6-8 servings.    *I find wild rice to be strong so I use 1 part wild rice, 3 parts long  grain white rice.    ** Chicken broth can be made by dissolving 3 chicken boullion cubes in 3  cups boiling water, or use canned chicken broth.
