Pfeffernusse
Ginger, Cut citron, Egg whites (beaten), Lemon rind, Egg yolks, Pepper, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Chopped almonds, Sugar, Flour, Allspice, 
At Christmas time for sugar and spice these pfeffernusse are extra nice:  try them once and youll be delighted    And so will the guests whom youve invited.    Heres how its done by the German folks: add half of the sugar to the  beaten yolks, combine the mixture with flour and spices    But keep it away from ratses and mices.    The rest of the sugar and egg whites you take, with fruits and nuts a blend  you make. To ripen it now you store it away    And bake 18 minutes, the very next day.    Sugar while warm and you can be sure theyll tempt the taste of an  epicure.FROM:    DOLORES MCCANN   (BSWN00A)
