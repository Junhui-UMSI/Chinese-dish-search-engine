Bearnaise Sauce
Sprigs Fresh Parsley, Dried Tarragon, Dry white wine, Whole black peppercorns, Egg yolks, Butter, Tarragon Vinegar, Water, Fresh Lemon Juice, Cayenne, Chopped Green Onions *, 
* Green onions should be finely chopped along with some tops.  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------  In a small non-aluminum saucepan, bring the wine, vinegar, onions,  tarragon, parsley and peppercorns to a boil.  Cook until it is reduced to  about 2 tablespoons.  Strain the liquid and press the solids to get as much  of the flavor from them as possible.  Add the lemon juice and water to the  reduced wine mixture and heat to a simmer.  Whisk the egg yolks in the top  of a double boiler until thick and lemon colored.  Add the above liquid, a  tablespoon at a time and whisk after each addition.  The mixture should be  thick and almost double in size.  Dribble in the butter, whisking  constantly until the mixture forms a slowly dissolving ribbon when drawn  across itself.  Whisk in cayenne.  At this point it should be ready. It is  important to know that the sauce will thicken considerably within the first  few minutes after it is removed from the heat.  The mistake that most make,  is that they try to make Hollandaise and Bearnaise sauces too thick while  over the heat, and the next thing they have is scrambled eggs floating in  butter.  The sauce will thicken in the first minute after removing from the  heat.  From: Syds Cookbook.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/sydsbook.zip
