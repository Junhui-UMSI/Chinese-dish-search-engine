Preheat oven at 400.   To prepare pastry, combine flour, 2 packages cream cheese and 4 sticks of butter in a mixing bowl. Beat until thoroughly combined. Cover and chill till easy to handle. On a sugared surface roll each dough 1/8 thick and cut into 2 x 2" squares with a pastry cutter. Add about a teaspoon of filling in the center of each square. Fold opposite corners to the center with one overlapping the other. Moisten the corners to help them stick together. Lightly brush with water and sprinkle with sugar. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned.      To prepare cream cheese filling, combine remaining cream cheese, 1  tablespoon margarine, 1/4 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl.   To prepare poppy seed filling, combine poppy seeds and water in a saucepan.  Cook over low heat until most of the water is absorbed, about 1 hour. Add milk and 1/2 cup sugar. Return to low heat and cook 10 minutes. Watch sauce carefully not to scorch. Stir in one tablespoon margarine, vanilla and salt. Set aside to cool.   To prepare cottage cheese filling, press as much moisture as possible out of cottage cheese. In a mixing bowl, combine cottage cheese, sugar and cinnamon until blended.
