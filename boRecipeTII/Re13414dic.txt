From: aring@shani.net    Date: Fri, 26 Jul 96 21:48:13 PDT  This recipe is a lot of work, and takes a lot of time, but dont stop  reading now...it is really good!    Drain the cheese in a towel hung over the sink for 3-4 hours.  Take the  remaining cheese ball and mix with the rest of the ingredients and  refrigerate.    Dough:  Mix 1 T sugar with the water and yeast and let foam.  Add margarine  sugar and eggs.  Add the rest and mix well.  It makes a sticky dough.    Roll out the entire dough into one very large rectangle on a well floured  surface.  Smear with 1 1/2 cups of margarine, folding like a business  letter and then folding the outside ends in thirds to the middle.  Refrigerate for several hours.    Divide the dough into 6 balls. Roll out into a 81/2 x 11 rectanle.  Put  cheese in row down the center.  Cut slits on the diagonal from the outer  edge of the dough to just before the cheese and cover into a "mock braid"  not overlapping the two sides by a lot (barely overlap so the piece you  receive to eat isnt too doughy!). Bake until golden brown. Boil 1 cup of  sugar with 1/2 cup of water and pour syrup over hot loaves. Freezes well  also!    JEWISH-FOOD digest 283    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
