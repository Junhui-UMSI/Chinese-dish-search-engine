Pumpkin in Pastry Thingies
PASTRY, Ginger, Sugar, Beer, (16 ounce) pumpkin, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Shortening, Flour, Cinnamon, Salt, 
Sure...if someone could name them! I know they are a traditional mexican  dessert but I cant think of their name! This is what I did...    You can vary these spices--I really am just estimating..cause I just  dumpted them in, to be truthful--then I simmmered it in an uncovered pot  for about an hour and a half--while we were eating dinner..made the apt.  smell wonderful. THEN, for the pastry, you can use this recipe--    mix the flour and salt and cut in the shortening, until it is crumbly, make  a well and pour the beer into it...mix together, for 1 1/2 in balls...roll  into 1/2 in. thick 4 in. circles...(If they are very firm, let them sit a  while)...then place 2 tb. pumpkin and fold the circles in half, you may  need to take some water to seal the edges, then use a fork to press them  together--bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes.    But, Ill admit, that I made some much food that we were quite stuffed, so  I didnt feel like making the pastry after dinner, so I just served the  pumpkin with some icecream and cookies!
