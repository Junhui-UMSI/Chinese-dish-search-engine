Traditional Carrot Salad
Fresh carrots; washed and, Grated apple, (8 oz) crushed pineapple in, Mayo (up to 2), Snack size boxes of golden, 
Combine carrots, raisins, pineapple and apple. Toss well, then add mayo and  pineapple juice. Blend thoroughly, and chill before serving.    Notes: Depending on my mood, sometimes add cinnamon and/or chunked, rather  than crushed pineapple. The salad should be moist, not dry. If its too  wet, you can either add more carrots, or simply serve with a slotted spoon.  I opt for the slotted spoon, because the to me, the salad is better _wet_:)  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #239 by leiba@eskimo.com on Aug 25, 1997
