Alpine Potato-Vegetable Soup - Jane Brody
Onion, Zucchini, Fresh dill, celery, Chicken broth, Russet potatoes, Salt, Butter, Black pepper, Garlic, Fresh parsley, Carrots, 
In a large saucepan, saute the garlic and the onion in the butter until  onion is translucent.    Add the broth, potatoes, carrots, celery [no tops], and zucchini to the  pan.    Bring the soup to a boil, simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until potatoes  are tender.    Add the dill, parsley, salt and pepper, reserved celery tops, and if  desired, the thickener (1 T. cornstarch dissolved in 3T. water). Simmer the  soup until it is slightly thickened. Serve immediately, with croutons, if  desired.    NOTES : very good - nice to have a vegetable soup without tomatoes    Recipe by: Jane Brody    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by KSBAUM <KSBAUM@aol.com> on Mar 29, 1998
