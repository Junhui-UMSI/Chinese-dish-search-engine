Quick Alfredo Sauce
Sour cream, parmesan cheese, Garlic powder, Dried herbs, 
Just mix everything up and toss with youre favorite pasta! For less fat,  use a reduced fat sour cream or even a fat free. I havent tried it, but  strained non-fat plain yogurt would probably work as well.    Posted to rec.food.recipes by gt6944c@prism.gatech.edu (Kaita) on 1994y, .
