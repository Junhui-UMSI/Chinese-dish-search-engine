If you scale the recipe up or down, adjust accordingly. -The "del monte cajun" ingredient appears to have been a canned diced tomato product from Del Monte.  We just use  a can of diced tomatoes with cajun seasoning thrown in. -I also like to add the bell pepper with the celery and rice, instead of waiting until 20 minutes. -I added the parsley at 20 minutes and cooked 5 more minutes.  Don't know why they repeated that twice in the text but I don't think they meant 10 minutes of cook time after the parsley is added.
