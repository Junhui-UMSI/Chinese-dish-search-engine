Generously grease an 8x8 pan (or cast iron  skillet) and put it in the oven to get hot while you mix up the bread.    In medium bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Stir in remaining ingredients, beating by hand JUST until well mixed.  (There will still be a few lumps.) Pour batter into hot, prepared pan. Bake  for 18-22 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cut into squares, and serve hot.    Personal note: As a kid, we would crumble cornbread into a glass of milk  for an afternoon snack. I still love it this way, but my daughter thinks  its disgusting!    PS...I do have Grannys recipe for authentic southern Hush Puppies if youd  like that one....    EAT-L Digest  9 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
