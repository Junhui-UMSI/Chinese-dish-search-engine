Strawberry Rhubarb Leather
Sugar, Rhubarb, Strawberries sliced, Water, 
Combine finely chopped rhubarb and water. Simmer over medium heat for about  5 minutes. Add strawberries and sugar. Simmer another 5 minutes. Puree  mixture until smooth in a blender or food processor. Dehydrate in a  dehydrator or in oven.*    To dry in an oven just set temp at lowest possible setting --about 140  degress would be good.  Dry until fruit feels leather like ;yet pliable.  This would probably best be done on parchment paper,  Remove the leather  while it is still warm and roll it up.
