For those of you have who have asked for Thanksgiving recipes, here is one  I modified from Steven Raichlens High-Flavor Low-Fat Vegetarian Cooking  cookbook. It has wonderful flavor and its a very attractive dish.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut squashes in half crosswise. Take out  seeds. Cut a small slice from the top and bottom so they will stand  straight. Bake, cut side down, on a baking sheet oiled with spray until  soft, about 40 minutes. Transfer to cake rack to cool. For stuffing, plump  the currents in the vegetable broth or stock for 10 minutes. Meanwhile,  cook onions, celery, and garlic in broth or wine over medium heat until  soft. Add apple and corn, if using, and cook about three minutes. Transfer  the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the bread crumbs, herbs, lemon  zest, currants with the stock, and salt and pepper to taste. The mixture  should be highly seasoned, and moist but not wet. Add stock or salt as  needed and spoon into the baked squashes. (The recipe can be prepared ahead  to this point.) Just before serving, bake the stuffed squashes at 375  degrees until thoroughly heated, 15 to 20 minutes. Makes 8 servings.    The illustration for this recipe shows each halved squash decoratively cut  on top in a zig-zag pattern. I didnt attempt it, but when they are cut in  half, the zig-zag shape of the squash itself makes it very attractive. And  being able to prepare most of it ahead makes this a great addition to the  Thanksgiving menu.    Posted to fatfree digest V97 #275 by Margaret Webb  <atheros@scan.missouri.org> on Nov 24, 1997
