Cook off remaining tortillas.    In a glass dish combine chicken, garlic, lime juice, chili powder, oregano  and olive oil. Let chicken marinate for 15 minutes.    Refried Beans: Heat oil in a heavy saucepan and cook onions until tender.  Add beans and water and bring to a simmer. Stir beans and stir  occasionally. Beans are done when they begin to clump together in one mass.  Season with salt and pepper.    Heat grill, broiler or cast iron grill pan and cook chicken breasts for 4  minutes per side or until cooked through. Slice chicken in thin slices and  keep warm. In a small bowl mix together the salsa and sour cream and chill.    To assemble tostado: Evenly layer beans, lettuce, tomatoes, chicken slices,  red onion, cheese, and cilantro on top of each tostado (crisped tortilla)  and serve immediately. Garnish with creamy salsa and cilantro.
