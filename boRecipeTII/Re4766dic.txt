Phyllo Triangles with Lobster Filling
Lobster - steamed, Unsalted butter, White wine - or vodka, Whipping cream, salt and pepper, Phyllo, Flour, Unsalted butter, Green onions - finely, Cayenne pepper, 
Number of Servings:  50    Remove all the meat from the lobster and chop.  Set aside. Melt 2  tablespoons butter in a small skillet, and saute the green onions for 2 or  3 minutes. Add the lobster meat and wine or vodka, and stir quickly to  combine over high heat.  Drain the mixture, reserving the liquid. Melt the  remaining 2 tablespoons butter in another skillet. Add the flour and cook  slowly without coloring the flour for 5 minutes. Add the reserved liquid  and the cream, and stir constantly until the mixture begins to thicken.  Stir lobster meat back into mixture, add cayenne pepper and season to  taste.  Cool mixture before filling phyllo. To assemble the triangles, melt  and cool the pound of butter. Place one sheet of phyllo on a flat surface  and brush lightly with butter. Top this with two more sheets, buttering  each.  Cut the sheets in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into  6 equal parts. Spoon a teaspoon of filling onto the end of each strip and  form a triangle by folding the righthand corner to the opposite side, as  you would a flag.  Continue folding until the entire strip is used. Preheat  oven to 400F.  Place triangles on a buttered baking sheet. Brush the tops  of each with melted butter and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.    NOTE:  Filled phyllo triangles can be kept in the refrigerator, unbaked,  for 2 days, or frozen immediately for future use.    Recipe from Martha Stewarts "Hors dOeuvres".
