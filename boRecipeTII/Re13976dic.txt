Source: Byerly Bag    This recipe was translated from a very old Russia cookbook, but has been  stream-lined using canned beets. Adding cookd cubed beef to the soup will  make it a hearty one-dish meal. The soup may also be pureeed until smooth.  This same soup is traditionally served cold during the summer months.    In large saucepan melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, celery and  carrots; cook 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add beets, broth, potato,  cabbage, salt and pepper; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat;  cover and simmer 20-25 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in  brown sugar, tomato paste and vinegar; simmer uncovered 5 minutes. Ladle  into shallow soup bowls and serve with sour cream and dill, if desired.
