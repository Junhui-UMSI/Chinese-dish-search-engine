Pumpkin Risotto
Salt & freshly ground black, Arborio rice, Shallots, Vegetable stock, Pumpkin flesh, Chicken stock, Fresh sage, Pepper, Powdered saffron, Dry white wine, 
Wrap cubed pumpkin in foil and bake at 350o for 30 min.  While it is  baking, saute shallots in a little white wine, water or stock. In a  seperate pan, bring the stock to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Puree  pumpkin and set aside. Add rice to shallots and cook 2-3 minutes over  moderate heat stirring frequently. Add wine and saffron and cook, stirring  constantly until all the lquid has been absorbed. Add the pumpkin and 1 c  stock stirring constantly. After that is absorbed, add the stock 1/2 cup at  a time stirring constantly until absorbed until the rice is cooked (about  15-20 min).  If you run out of stock add hot water. The risotto should be  thick and creamy in consistensy and just a little runny. When done remove  from heat, add the sage, salt and pepper to taste. If you want to add 1/4 c  grated parmesan it would add 1 gram fat/ serving.    adapted this from New York Magazine (10/31/94).    Serve with white wine and crusty Italian bread.
