Thomas" <jethomas@mailbox.syr.edu>  I came up with this because I dont eat dairy and wanted something to put  on my bagels  :-)    Put all but the currants in a blender and blend until smooth.  If it is not  thick enough, you can add a mixture of cornstarch and water that have been  heated and thickened to the mixture.  Add soymilk if its too thick.  I  always have the tofu in my freezer; it doesnt *have* to be frozen first,  but it should be well drained.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #158    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
