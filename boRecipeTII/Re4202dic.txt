With scissors, snip stems from figs.  Then snip figs into small pieces.  Heat them in milk in top of double boiler until figs are soft (about 20  minutes).  Remove from heat, stir figs thoroughly until mashed.  Add  shortening, bread crumbs, sugar and tapioca.  Sift and measure flour, and  sift again with other dry ingredients.  Add with molasses and chopped  walnuts.  Fold in stiffly whipped egg whites.  Turn into generously  buttered 2-quart mold, cover tightly and steam, covered, for 3 hours on a  rack in hot water that must come half-way up side of mold.  Or steam in  individual molds.  Serve piping hot, with burning red candle on top.  Deck  with holly, and be generous with the hard sauce!  Serves 8-10.
