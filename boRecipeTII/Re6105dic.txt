Pizza Dough 
Yeast, Flour, Sugar, Salt, olive oil, Water, 
Bring all ingredients to room temp and add to breadmaker. Select "white  dough" cycle and press Start.    At end of cycle, remove dough and divide into halves. Preheat oven to 450.  Roll or shape into pizzas on surface dusted with cornmeal. Add toppings of  choice and bake 15 minutes on bottom rack, to make sure crust gets done.    Sylvias notes: I modified this from one posted on GEnie by G.GARVEY2  10/30/91, and was thoroughly delighted with the result. The dough was easy  to work with and stretched well; I even played "Italian pizza maker" and  threw the thing into the air to stretch it. We had company for dinner, and  when I asked for comments because I wasnt an accomplished pizza maker, one  guest responded "you are now!"
