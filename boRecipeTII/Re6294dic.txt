Plain or Spinach Pasta
Eggs, Eggs, 
I make my pasta in the food processor with the steel blades. I put my flour  in first and spin. Then I drizzle the beaten eggs through the tube. I let  it run until the dough cleans the bowl. For a spinach pasta, I put the  spinach in with the flour and spin for about a minute before adding the  eggs.     Note from MK: I use the same recipe and method, using large eggs and  unbleached flour.
