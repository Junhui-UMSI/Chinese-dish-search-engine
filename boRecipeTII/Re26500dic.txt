Cut or chop into small bits.  Shred the cheese. Preheat  oven to 325 degrees.  Stir cornmeal into the cold water in the saucepan and  place over medium heat.  Bring to a bubbling boil, stirring constantly.  When it is thick-perhaps 60 seconds-remove from heat.  Stir in the cheese,  butter, garlic and salt.  When cheese is melted pour in the milk. Stir in  egg yolks and add bacon bits.  Beat egg whites stiff, and fold them into  the batter.  pour into the casserole or souffle dish (one 2-quart casserole  or souffle dish, greased).  Level the batter with rubber spatula. Bake in  the oven for about 1 hour.  The bread will be nicely browned, high and  puffy.  Slip a knife blade into the center of the casserole.  If the blade  comes out clean and dry, the spoon bread is done.  If not, return to the  oven for an additional 10 minutes. Remove bread from the oven. Serve while  hot.
