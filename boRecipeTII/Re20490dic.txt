Preheat oven to 350F.    Melt first 2 ingredients together in a 9"-square cake pan by putting  the pan with the ingredients into the oven as it is preheating.    While the ingredients are melting, mix the next 4 ingredients  together and then mix them into the melted butter and honey.  Lay  apple slices in the syrup to completely cover the bottom of the cake  pan in an attractive way. (You may need more than one apple if you  use a small one.)    Fill a 1-cup measuring cup with pitted dates, but dont pack the  dates into the cup.  With the dates in the cup, fill the cup with  water, then pour both dates and water into a blender.  Add 1/2 cup  more water into the blender.  Now blend till it forms a smooth, thick  paste. Add the 1/4 cup butter or margarine and blend till totally  whipped in. Put the blender mixture into a mixing bowl and add the  last 5 dry ingredients. Mix just long enough to thoroughly blend in  all the dry ingredients. Pour this batter on top of apple slices and  spread evenly in the cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40  minutes or till a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes  out clean. When done, remove from oven and immediately turn the cake  pan upside down to empty out onto a serving platter.
