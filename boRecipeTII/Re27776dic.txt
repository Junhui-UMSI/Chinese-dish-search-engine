This is a quote from the Neiman Marcus web site at  http://www.neimanmarcus.com/    Neiman Marcus never served cookies in our restaurants until recently, when  we developed a new chocolate chip cookie in response to this myth!  Following is the recipe (free of charge, of course.) Please feel free to  share this letter and the recipe with anyone you know who may be similarly  interested in the truth behind this "cookie that wont crumble!"    This is their cookie recipe which is *different* from the one posted with  the urban legend. I hear these cookies are good! :)) Lynn mcgrew@ntr.net    Cream the butter with the sugars until fluffy. Beat in the egg and the  vanilla extract. Combine the dry ingredients and beat into the butter  mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by large spoonfuls onto a  greased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes, or 10-12  minutes for a crispier cookie    NOTES : Makes 12-15 large cookies    Recipe by: Neiman Marcus at http://www.neimanmarcus.com/    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 491 by "Lynn Ratcliffe"  <mcgrew@ntr.net> on Jan 10, 1998
