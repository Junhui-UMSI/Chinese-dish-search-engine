Zucchini Con Salsa
Jack cheese or white Mexican, Zucchinis or yellow summer, Salsa; 6 to 8 ounces in all, Cloves of garlic; minced, 
This is a fine summer dish to use with the mild canned salsas available to  most people.    Lightly grease a casserole. Fill the casserole with sliced zucchini.  Sprinkle with garlic. Pour the salsa over the squash and seal the  casserole. Bake 30 minutes at 375. Open the casserole and sprinkle with  cheese. Cook open just until cheese is melted.
