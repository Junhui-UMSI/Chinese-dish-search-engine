Marjoram goes well with fish, and heres a recipe that uses it both in and  on the fish.  Neither lake trout nor salmon need be scaled, but do scale  the pike.  A whole baked fish on a garnished platter always looks good to  guests. Salt and pepper the fish inside and out, then stuff it and sew up  or skewer the opening.    Place in a buttered pan and lay lemon slices along its length. Stick a  toothpick in each slice.    Add the vegetables, marjoram, bay leaf, and white wine and bake,  uncovered, for about 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven, basting first with  the melted butter and then with the liquid in the pan. CELERY STUFFING  Saute the chopped celery and onions in butter in a small skillet for 15  minutes, until tender but still with a little bite.    Add the chopped celery tops and the bread crumbs.  Season to taste with  salt, pepper, and savory.  Makes 1 cup. FENNEL SEED AND TARRAGON STUFFING    Mix all ingredients together and stuff fish.
