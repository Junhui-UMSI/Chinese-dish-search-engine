Here is a delicious casserole that my cousin Laura Keown prepared for me  when my daughter was born. My family enjoys this.    Brown ground beef and chopped onion. Meanwhile, cook the Ramen noodles. Add  the beef flavor packet to the ground beef mixture. When beef is browned &  noodles are cooked, place both in casserole. Add soups, water chestnuts,  (optional) celery, and first 1/2 cup of grated cheese. Mix. Top with second      1/2    cup grated cheese.    Bake uncovered at 350 for 20-25 minutes.
