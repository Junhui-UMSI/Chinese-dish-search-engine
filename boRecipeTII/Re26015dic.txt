Wrap tofu in a kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels. Place on a  cutting board, and weight with an iron skillet or wooden cutting board for  30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, saute onion and garlic in oil until onion is  limp and slightly brown on the edges.     Remove towels and place tofu in a large bowl. Mash with a fork and add  onion-garlic mixture. Add chili sauce, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce,  cumin, bread crumbs and hazelnuts if desired; mix well. Place in a food  processor and pulse to form a uniform texture.     Add salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. With wet hands,  shape tofu mixture into 8 to 10 patties and place on a well oiled vegetable  grill.     Handle patties gently; theyre delicate. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each  side, until browned. Variation:     Instead of grilling, saute burgers in olive oil until lightly browned on  both sides.     Note:  This burger is especially tasty when served with a spicy sauce made  of low-sodium soy sauce mixed with chili sauce or barbecue sauce and topped  with sauteed mushrooms.
