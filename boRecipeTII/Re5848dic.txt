1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Place the peppers on a baking sheet and  roast for 1/2 hour.  Place in a brown paper bag, seal and let rest for 15  minutes.  Use a sharp knife to remove the skins and seeds, leaving the  peppers as intact as possible.    2. Place the oil in a skillet over high heat and saute the garlic until  gold, about one minute. Add the fresh or canned tomatoes (a 14 oz. can of  stewed plum tomatoes may be substituted), crushing them between your  fingers while allowing as few seeds as possible into the sauce. Season with  salt and pepper, add the sugar and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring  occasionally.    3. Set the oven at 350 degrees. Slip a slice of cheese inside each pepper,  place in a baking dish, cover with tomato sauce and bake for 20 minutes.  Serve very hot    Recipe by: Claudia Roden in NYTimes 3/30/97 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1  #562 by Jane Rosenberg-Coombs <jfcoombs@ilinks.net> on Apr 12, 1997
