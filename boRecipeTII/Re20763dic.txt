Put apple on center of each  pastry square. Fill with mixture of sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg.  Dot each with  teaspoon of butter.  Bring points of pastry up over apple and overlap.  Place a little apart in baking pan. Pour 1 cup hot syrup mixture around  dumplings. Bake at 425 degrees for 45 minutes. Just before serving pour  rest of warm syrup over dumplings and serve with cream.    Variation: Peach Dumplings: 3 large peaches, peeled and pitted (in place of  apples).  Put peach half on center of each square and proceed as for apple  dumplings above.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
