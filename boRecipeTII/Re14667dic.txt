"Stedda" Ricotta
Soft tofu, Some water, Spoon of ground nutmeg, Spoon of salt; (or less), 
I use this very simple recipe from the The American vegetarian cookbook:  from the fit for life kitchen. You can use this recipe instead of the  ricotta in this way or you can mix it through your (home made) tomato  sauce.    Blend 3/4 of the tofu with the nutmeg and salt. Add some water to smooth.  Mash the rest of the tofu through with a fork.  Posted to fatfree digest by "Boxel" <boxel@sr.net> on May 21, 1998
