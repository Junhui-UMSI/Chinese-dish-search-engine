Chef Jacky Pluton of Carlos in Highland Park prepares this dish with  scallops in the shells, which are very difficult to obtain, and uses fried  onion slices and fried rice noodles as part of the garniture.    1. Prepare the sauce. In a medium saucepan, cook the shallots in 1  tablespoon butter until they become translucent. Add the carrots, celery  and bay leaf and cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring several times. Add  the wine, bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half. Add the stock and  continue to reduce until the sauce has a light syrup consistency. Strain  through a fine sieve and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Set aside.    2. While sauce is reducing, prepare couscous and lentils by package  directions. Combine and set aside. Recipe may be done ahead to this point.    3. Prepare scallops. Make a ring of the couscous-lentil mixture around the  interior edge of 4 heat-proof soup plates and place in a warming oven.  Reheat sauce. Add scallops to sauce and simmer until just firm, 2 to 3  minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet and saut the  leek and truffles until the leeks are tender, about 2 minutes.    4. Make a bed of leek and truffles in the center of each plate. Arrange six  scallops atop each bed and spoon sauce over the scallops and the couscous  mixture. Garnish with thyme, tarragon and chives and serve at once with the  same wine used for the sauce.
