Since this dish is rich, steamed broccoli or string beans and a green salad  wouldf be ideal accompianiments.    (Sarah-style abbreviations due to editor problems, please forgive)    Place everything exxcept basil/coriander in cooker, lock in place. Over  high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower heat just enough to keep at high  pressure anmd cook 5 minutes. Use quick release method to lower pressure.    If the potatoes arent tender yet, replace (but dont lock) lid and cook in  residual heat and steam for a few more minutes.    Coarsely mash some or all of the potatoes, add the basil and extra soy  sauce if desires.    Note: It wasnt until the end of the recipe that I realize that this was  one I have NOT tried, but one similar to one I *DID* make. Ill post that  one, too...
