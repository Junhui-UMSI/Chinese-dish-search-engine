Pizza Dolce Di Ricotta
Eggs, Vanilla extract, Flour, Finely diced citron, Eggs, Sugar, Sugar, Anisette, Cold unsalted butter, PASTA FROLLA, RICOTTA FILLING, Whole-milk ricotta, Baking Powder, Salt, Cinnamon; divided, 
One 9 by 2-inch deep cake pan, buttered. Set a rack in the lowest level of  the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.    For the Pasta Frolla, mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl. Rub  butter in finely and stir in beaten eggs. Press dough together, wrap in  plastic and refrigerate until firm.    For the Ricotta Filling, beat ricotta by hand until smooth. Stir in sugar,  then eggs, one at a time. Stir in remaining ingredients, reserving half the  cinnamon for the top of the Torta, being careful not to overmix.    To assemble, cut off 1/3 of the Pasta Frolla and reserve it. Roll the 2/3  of the dough into a 16-inch disk and line a buttered and paper-lined 9-inch  cake pan with it. Allow the dough to hang over the edge of the mold. Pour  in the Ricotta Filling and sprinkle it with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon  cinnamon.    Roll the remaining 1/3 of the dough into a rectangle and cut it into 10  1-inch wide strips. Paint the strips with beaten egg. Moisten the rim of  the dough on the pan with the beaten egg, and adhere 5 strips in each  direction, forming a diagonal lattice. Trim away any excess dough even with  the top of the pan and push the dough all around off the top rim of the pan  so that it is completely within the pan.    Bake for about 45 minutes until light golden and puffed around the edges.  Cool in the pan before unmolding.    Yield: one 9-inch cake, about 10 servings    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #8973    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #810 by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Sep 26, 1997
