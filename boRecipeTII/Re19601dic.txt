http://www.santesson.com/recept/favlist.htm    "Allt om Mat" is a leading Swedish food magazine. We were immensely proud  when it published our recipe for Anna cutlets in the early 1970s. (We also  appreciated when the magazine, 25 years later, included a link to our  recipe collection - see AoM #17, 1997.) It is a very convenient dish, can  be prepared long in advance with everything contained in one pot.    1.Fry the mushroom slices briefly in a hot frying-pan.    2.Place the pork cuts in a buttered gratin dish and cover them with the  mushrooms, then put the potato slices on top in a even layer.    3.Use salt and pepper as desired, then top with very thin slices of butter.    4.Cook in the oven at 200 - 225 oC for 45 minutes.  Serve together with a tomato-lettuce-cucumber salad.  Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 17, 1998
