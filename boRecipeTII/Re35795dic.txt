Heat oil and cook diced eggplant, tomatoes, green pepper, onion and  garlic until tender. Add cooked rice and seasonings, and stir to  combine. Stuff mixture into the eggplant shells and dot with butter.    Bake in a preheated, 350F. oven about 35 minutes or until eggplant  shells are tender. Makes two main dish servings.
