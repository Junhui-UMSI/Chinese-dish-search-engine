Baked Oysters with Crabmeat Gratinee
Homestead seafood sauce, parm cheese, Lump crabmeat, Fresh oysters, Rock salt, 
Instructions:     Prepare seafood sauce. Preheat oven to 325 deg. f .  Carefully pick the crabmeat to remove any shells or cartilage. Put it into  a small bowl and using a rubber spatula, gently fold in 1/4 cup of the  seafood sauce. Being careful not to break up the lumps. Spread 1 tbsp of  this mixture over each oyster on the half shell and top them off with 1/2  tsp of the seafood sauce. Grate the parmasan on the fine side of the box  grater and sprinkle it over each oyster. Spread a layer of rock salt in the  bottom of the baking dish to stabilizer the oysters during baking. Nestle  the oysters into the salt, bake for 6 minutes then turn on the broiler just  long enough to get a golden brown glaze. Serve at once while the oysters  are piping hot.
