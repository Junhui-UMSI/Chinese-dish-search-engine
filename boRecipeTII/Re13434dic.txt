Yeast-Risen Cornbread
All-purpose flour, olive oil, Salt, Boiling water, Yellow cornmeal; pref., Active dry yeast, 
In a blender or food processor, grind cornmeal, in 1/4-cup batches, until  fine and powdery.    In a large mising bowl, combine 1 cup ground cornmeal, boiling water, oil  and salt; stir until smooth. Let cool to room temperature, about 20  minutes. Stir in yeast.    Stirring constantly, gradually add remaining 1/2 cup ground cornmeal and 1  cup flour. Continue add flour until dough forms a soft mass and is too  difficult to stir.    Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise until doubled in bulk,  about       30    minutes.    Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead, gradually  incorporating the remaining flour as necessary, until dough is smooth and  elastic, 8 to 10 minutes.    Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with nonstick spray.    Form dough into a ball and flatten slightly. Place on prepared baking  sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or wax paper and let rise until  doubled in bulk, 30 to 45 minutes.    Preheat oven to 350F.    Bake loaf for 40 to 50 minutes, or until top is golden and bottom sounds  hollow when tapped.  Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely before  slicing.
