1.  In a Dutch oven, or large pan with a tight-fitting cover, brown meat in  fat.  Season with salt and pepper and remove from pan. Pour off fat  drippings. 2. Add the apple juice, tomato sauce, onion, ginger, cinnamon,  salt, vinegar, and bay leaf; mix well. 3. Return meat to pan. Cover and  simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours, or until done. (Or cook in a 325F oven for  same amount of time.) 4. Turn meat once to cook it evenly throughout. When  done, remove meat and keep warm. Discard bay leaf. 5. For 2 cups of gravy,  pour liquid from pan into a 2-cup measuring cup. Let stand for 1 minute to  allow fat to come to top. Discard all but 4 Tablespoons (or less) of fat.  Add enough water (or other liquid) to measure 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Return  to pan. 6. In same cup, measure 1/2 cup cold water and blend in flour. Add  mixture slowly to liquid in pan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, and  cook until thickened, about 3 minutes. Taste gravy and correct seasoning,  if necessary, with salt and pepper. 7. Slice meat; serve gravy separately.
