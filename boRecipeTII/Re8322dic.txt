Potato Pups
potatoes, Dry mustard, Hot dogs, 
From: Grandma Sheila, COOKING echo    Split hot dogs the long way not quite all the way through.  Fill split  opening with mashed potatoes mixed with dry mustard. Sprinkle the top with  paprika. Bake in 375 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until heated  through and slightly browned on top. Can also be topped with some grated  cheese (cheddar or parmesan).    These make a great lunch or dinner for kids.  Mine used to ask for them  regularly - still do now that they are grown.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/kids.zip
