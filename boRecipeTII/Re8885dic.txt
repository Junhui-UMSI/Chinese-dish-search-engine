Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails on.  Split each lengthwise  through the back almost to the front in order to butterfly. Spread open and  lay cut side down; press to flatten. Set aside.  Bring a pot of salted  water to boil and cook the noodles until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain  and cool. Heat a wok at high temperature with 2 tbs. oil. Add the noodles  and cook without stirring until browned on one side. Turn the noodles over  and cook the other side until golden brown, then break up with chopsticks  and stir-fry briefly. Remove the noodles, drain, and set aside. Reheat the  wok with the remaining 2 tbs. oil. Add the onions, shrimp, and vegetables.  Toss and stir-fry until the vegetables are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes.  Take care not to overcook the shrimp--they cook fast when butterflied. Stir  in the sugar, five-spice powder, soy sauce oyster sauce, and sesame oil.  Add noodles & Chicken Broth. Combine cornstarch w/ cold water to make  smooth paste. Slowly add to stock,stirring constantly. Cook until sauce  thickens & becomes clear. Serve immediately. Chinese five-spice is a  curry-like mixture of spices. Sesame oil is strong & aromatic. Used  sparingly, it is a great complement to many dishes. Both are available at  oriental markets & most grocery stores.    ORIENT EXPRESS    KETCHUM, SUN VALLEY.
