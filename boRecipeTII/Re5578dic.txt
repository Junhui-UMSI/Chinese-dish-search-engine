Applesauce, Crushed pineapple, Baking Powder, Vanilla, Brown Sugar**, Baking soda, Salt, White flour, Raisins, Egg white, 
Preheat oven to 375    Cream applesauce and sugar. Add vanilla and egg white. Next add pineapple  and raisins. Sift dry ingredients into creamed mixture. Bake on greased  cookie sheet, or line the sheet with tin foil, for 8-10 min.    **The original recipe called for 1 Cup of brown sugar, but I thought 1/2  was sweet enough.
