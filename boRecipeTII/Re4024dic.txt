Sugar, Water, Lemon juice, All purpose flour, Vegetable oil, Black pepper coarsely ground, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 350F. Mix flour, salt, pepper & sugar in a large bowl or  food processor. Add oil & blend until the mixture resembles coarse  breadcrumbs. Combine water & lemon juice in a small bowl. Blend it into the  flour mixture. Add up to 1/4 c more water if necessary. The dough should  hold together. Divide dough into 2 equal portions. Roll each portion into a  rectangle as thinly as possible.  Using a spatula, rolling pin or your  hands, pick up the rolled dough & transfer to an ungreased cookie sheet.  Score into 2" squares, taking care not to cut all the way through. Prick  each square with a fork. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, turning over after 10  minutes or when the edges begin to brown. Cool on a rack. Break into  individual crackers. Serve with soups, dips & stews.
