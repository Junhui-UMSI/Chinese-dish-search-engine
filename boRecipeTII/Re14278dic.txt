In the South theyserve cold soups frequently as a refreshing foil to the  heat.  Thin slices of zucchini and the piquancy of dry white wine plus  Tabasco sauce give this gazpacho a delicious twist.  ~------------------------------------------------------ ~-----------------  Coarsely chop the tomatoes; you should have about 1 1/4 cups. Drain,  reserving the liquid (about 1/2 cup). In a large skillet, heat the oil over  medium heat.  Add the green onions, zucchini and garlic; saute for 1  minute.  Add the tomatoes, pepper, parsley, salt and Tabasco sauce.  Stirring frequently, cook for 5 minutes, or until the pepper is tender.  Turn the vegetables into a large bowl and mix in the reserved tomato liquid  and the broth and wine. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or  overnight.    From: The Tabasco Cookbook.
