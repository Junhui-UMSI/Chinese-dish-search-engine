Cut the bread in half and remove the soft center. Cut the garlic clove in  half and rub it on each half. Drizzle the bottom half of the bread with  about 1 tablespoon extravirgin olive oil and 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar.  Season with salt and pepper.    Cover bottom of bread with tomato slices, drizzle more olive oil, top with  12 basil leaves and the mint leaves.    In a bowl put the tuna, scallion, capers, nicoise olives, and stir them all  together. Place a portion of this mixture on the basil and mint leaves. Top  it with the anchovy fillets, if desired, the hard boiled egg slices, a  layer of sliced tomatoes, and the basil leaves. Drizzle with remaining  olive oil and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Place other half of the  bread on top.    Wrap the sandwiches in foil. Let them stand at room temperature for at  least one hour so that the dressing may saturate the bread.
