PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 250F. Salt and pepper the pork ribs evenly and place in  a baking dish and cook for 2 hours to render the fat and tenderize the  meat. Remove the ribs from the dish, drain the fat and set aside. Heat a  wok or large frying pan and add the oil. Quickly add the shallots,  scallions, ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for 20 seconds and add the rest of  the sauce ingredients. Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce gently for 15  minutes. Allow the sauce to cool. (These steps can be done hours ahead or  even the night before.) When you are ready to cook the ribs, smear them  with the barbecue sauce. Make a charcoal fire and, when the coals are ash  white, grill the ribs, basting with any remaining sauce. Cook the ribs for  5-to-10 minutes on each side, depending on thickness. Serve immediately.    KEN HOM  PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK    Date:    6/28/96 7:27 AM    From: dlassiter@atsva.com    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #133    From the MasterCook recipe list.
