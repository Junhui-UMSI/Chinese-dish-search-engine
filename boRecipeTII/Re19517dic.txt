Angu De Milho - Corn Angu
Cold water, Cornmeal, Butter, Salt, 
Place half of the water in a medium-size saucepan, add  the salt, and bring it to a boil over medium heat.  Slowly mix the cornmeal into the remaining water.  Gradually pour that mixture into the boiling water,  stirring constantly. Add the butter and continue to  stir constantly until the angu turns into a thick  porridge which will hold its shape. Pour the angu into  a well-buttered 6-cup mold. Let cool, then unmold.
