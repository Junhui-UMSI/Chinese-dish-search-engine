Return to heat and stir until meat boils and  thickens. Add soy sauce (for colour) and simmer for 5 - 10 minutes.  Allow to cool.    Pie Base: Sift flour and salt. Place water and dripping into  saucepan, stir until dripping melts. Remove from heat. Make a well in  centre of flour and add liquid. Stir until combined. Turn out onto a  lightly floured surface. Roll out pastry to line 8 greased pie tins.  Cut excess pastry from edges. (Hold pie tins upside down and trim  upside down). Fill centre with cold meat filling.    Pie Top: Roll out puff pastry and cut rounds for top of pies. Wet  edges of base pastry and gently press tops in place. Trim around  edges with sharp knife. Pierce centre with a sharp knife. Brush tops  with combined egg yolk and water. Bake in hot oven for 5 minutes or  until golden brown. Reduce heat to moderate and cook for a further 10  minutes.    Note: If you buy pie tins especially - never wash them, wipe them out  with paper towel.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
