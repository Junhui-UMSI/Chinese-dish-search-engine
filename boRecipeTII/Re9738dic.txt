Pumpkin Ravioli in Chicken Broth
FOR RAVIOLI, parmesan, FOR GARNISH, sage, Won ton wrappers, chicken stock, sage leaves, salt and pepper, Grated Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, pumpkin flesh, 
*To roast the pumpkin, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut the pumpkin in  half, scrape out seeds and string, and place cut side down in a roasting  pan. Roast until very tender, about 1 hour. When done, scrape out roasted  flesh and set aside 1 pound.    To make the filling, combine in a blender the roasted pumpkin, 1/3 cup of  grated Parmesan, and sage. Puree until smooth. Check for consistency and  taste. If needed, add the remaining    Parmesan. Season to taste with salt and pepper and cool.    Bring a kettle of salted water to a gentle boil for the ravioli.    Put 1 wrapper on a lightly floured surface and mound 1 level tablespoon  filling in center. Brush edges of wrapper with water and fold wrapper in  half to form a triangle, pressing around filling to force out air. Transfer  ravioli to a dry kitchen towel to drain. Make more ravioli with remaining  wrappers and filling in same manner, transferring to towel and turning  occasionally to    dry slightly.    Cook ravioli in gently boiling water in 2 batches 6 to 8 minutes, or until  they rise to surface and are tender. Do not let water boil vigorously once  ravioli have been added. With a spoon transfer ravioli to a paper towel  lined plate to drain.    In a saucepan, heat the chicken stock until simmering. Ladle about 1/3 cup  of stock into 4 individual serving dishes, divide the ravioli and garnish  with toasted pine nuts, freshly chopped sage and coarsely grated Parmesan.
