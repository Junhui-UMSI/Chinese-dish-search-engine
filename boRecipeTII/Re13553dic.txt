Wielkanocna Babka (Easter Babka)

Cream butter and sugar in large bowl. Beat 4 egg yolks until thick and  lemon-colored. Stir into creamed mixture. Soften yeast in 1/4 cup water.  *Use very warm water (115#F) for dry yeast; use lukewarm (80#F to 90#F) for  compressed. (I also proof my yeast by adding a teaspoon of sugar.) Add to  mixture with the lemon rind. Beat in salt and cinnamon. Add milk and flour  to make a soft dough. Stir in raisins. Knead in bowl until dough no longer  sticks to the hands. (I let my Oster Kitchen Center do most of the kneading  and then finish by hand.) Cover dough and let rise in a warm place until  doubled in bulk (about 2 hours). Punch down dough and let rest 10 minutes.  Butter a 3-quart bundt pan and shape dough to fit it. Put dough into pan,  cover and let rise again until doubled (about 1 1/2 hours). Beat remaining  egg yolk slightly with 2 tablespoons of water. Brush on raised dough and  sprinkle with almonds. Bake in preheated moderate oven (350#F) for about 30  minutes. Remove from oven and cool on rack.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 27 Jan 97 by "Raymond F. Falcon"  <rfalcon@MAILER.FSU.EDU> on Jan 28, 1997.
