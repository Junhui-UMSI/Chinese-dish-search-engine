Plain Basic Chili
Cloves, Vegetable oil, Chili powder, beef broth, Cumin, tomatoes, stewed, garlic, round or chuck steak, Oregano, onion, 
IN A LARGE DUTCH OVEN OR STOCKPOT, HEAT THE VEGETABLE OIL OVER MED-HIGH  HEAT. WHEN IT FRAGRANT, ADD THE ONIONS AND GARLIC AND SAUTE UNTIL THE ONION  IS TENDER-CRISP, REDUCING THE HEAT IF NECESSARY TO KEEP EVERYTHING FROM  BURNING. ADD THE CHILI POWDER AND STIR WELL. ADD THE BEEF, AND COOK UNTIL  THE BEEF BEGINS TO RELEASE ITS JUICES, MAKING THE CHILI POWDER INTO A  PASTE. POUR IN BEEF BROTH. USE YOUR HANDS TO CRUSH THE TOMATOES ROUGHLY,  THEN ADD TOMATOES AND JUICES TO THE KETTLE. COVER AND SIMMER UNTIL BEEF IS  TENDER, ABOUT 1 HOUR. SEASON WITH OREGANO AND CUMIN, ADDING MORE OR LESS OF  EACH AS DESIRED. TASTE THE CHILI; IF ITS TOO MILD TO SUIT, ADD CAYENNE  PEPPER TO TASTE.
