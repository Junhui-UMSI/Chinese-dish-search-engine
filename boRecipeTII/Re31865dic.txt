Thanks for the help with the leafy greens. I wanted to share a unique  Shabbos dish, but it included these two ingredients. The "spinak" is  probably some kind of Swiss Chard or other beet-leaf. In the following  recipe - you can use regular spinach.    recipe: Rina Boublil    Im not giving quantities. Just use whatever you use for any other chaulnt  dish (at least 1 handful of beans per person and 1 potato per person,  depending on the appetite of the people present ;-)].    a. saute spinach greens in oil until the oil is green and the greens are  black (not burned)[patience, it takes time]. You can save this in the  refrig. for future use. You need enough oil that the cut up greens wont  stick to the bottom + 2 tbs.    b. put together the chaulnt (legumes; meat; potatoes)in the pot. Add one  heaping tbs. spinach/oil mixture for 3 people. add cilantro, 1-2 tbs.  turmeric (I add salt just before serving). Mix. Add water to top of pot and  boil. note: the oil is what gives the chaulnt its distintive green color  and flavor - so make sure you dont drain all the oil.    c. put in crockpot or on hotplate to cook overnight. Make sure there is  enough water in the pot when it is set to cook.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #017    From: "Shoshana L.
