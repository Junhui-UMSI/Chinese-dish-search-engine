Almond Cakes
Sugar, Rose water; (optional), All-purpose flour, Blanched almonds, Vegetable cooking spray, Egg whites, 
Place almonds in food processor, and process until finely ground. Add sugar  and flour; process until blended. Add rose water and egg whites; process  until well-blended (the mixture will be very thick). With floured hands,  shape the dough into 28 balls, and place 2 inches apart on baking sheets  coated with cooking spray.    Bake at 325 degrees for 28 minutes or until crisp on the outside and soft  on the inside; cool on racks.    Yield: 28 cookies (serving size: 1 cookie).    The original version of these cookies called for 2 cups of almonds. We  replaced 1 cup with flour for a healthier, but still delicious,  alternative.
