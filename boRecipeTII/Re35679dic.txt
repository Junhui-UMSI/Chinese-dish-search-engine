Stuffed Bananas
Aluminum foil, Mint or plain chocolate, Banana per person, 
Leave the peel on the bananas and cut a slit deep down the side of each.  Stuff a teaspoon of chips into each banana and wrap in a double layer of  aluminum foil. Cover in coals and bake for 10 minutes. Eat with a spoon.  Nuts and marshmallows make a great addition to the stuffing instead of or  in addition to chocolate chips.
