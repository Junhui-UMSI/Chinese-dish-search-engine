Lemon Ice
Water, Granulated sugar, Lemon juice, Lemon Rind, 
Here is another recipe from the Pure Sweet sugar bag. If you live where  lemons grow plentifully and have access to lots of them this would be a  handy recipe to use.    In a saucepan, mix water and sugar and boil for 5 minutes. Cool, then stire  in combination of lemon juice and grated rind. Freeze, stirring  occassionally. When almost set, scoop into serving deshies and return to  freezer, or removed from freezer until desired softness to scoop into  dishes. Makes 1 1/2 quarts.    I thought the lemon ice would be very festive if the ice were put into the  lemon rind shells and frozen just like you do with orange sherbert or ice  in orange rind cups.
