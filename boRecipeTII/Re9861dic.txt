Pumpkin-Date Pudding
Chopped dates, All-purpose flour, Pecans, Brown sugar, Shortening, Fresh pumpkin; cooked and, Nutmeg, Ground ginger, Evaporated milk, Baking Powder, Ground cinnamon, Baking soda, (16 oz) pumpkin -or-, Eggs, Salt, 
Cream brown sugar and shortening. Add egg yolks, beating well. Mix flour,  salt, butter, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger  together and beat in alternately with pumpkin and milk. Fold in dates and  nuts. Beat egg whites until they hold stiff peaks and gently fold into  batter. Put mixture into a well-oiled or buttered 6-cup mold or souffle  dish. Place a small trivet in a crock pot large enough for the souffle  dish, and add about 1/2 to 3/4-inch of water to the crock pot. If you dont  have a trivet, make uniform balls or a "ring" from aluminum foil, just  thick enough to keep the souffle dish out of the water. Cut a round of wax  paper to fit the top of the souffle dish and lightly grease it so batter  will not stick as it rises, then wrap well with aluminum foil. Put in crock  pot and cook on low 4 to 5 hours.  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 408 by James and Susan Kirkland  <kirkland@gj.net> on Dec 27, 1997
