Sweet Potato Corn Soup
Fresh or frozen corn kernels, Onions; chopped, Garlic, Green chili; minced, Cubed sweet potatoes, salt and pepper, Ground cumin, Veggie stock, A red bell pepper, 
Ive been making this once a week--its so great. Its from a new lowfat  Moosewood cookbook:    Toss the onions, garlic, and chili in a soup pot with the stock and simmer  for about 10 minutes. Add the cumin and sweet potatoes and simmer for  another 10 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are soft. Add the corn and  red bell pepper and simmer for another 10 minutes. Put some of the soup in  a blender (I use one of the hand held jobbies and blend in the pot--be  careful of spatters) and season with salt and pepper and extra chili.  Incidentally, I usually add the garlic last, because that preserves more of  its beneficial agents, Im told.
