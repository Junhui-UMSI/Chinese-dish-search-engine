For a 10-serving scale use a 10-inch springform pan.    Melt chocolate with whipping cream in small heavy saucepan over low heat.  Stir until smooth. Cool mixture to room temperature.    In bowl, whisk cream cheese with sour cream and chocolate mixture. Set  aside.    Pour Grand Marnier into a shallow bowl. Pour first measure of sugar onto a  small plate. Trim a ladyfinger to height of the rim of a springform pan.  Quickly dip the cookie into the liqueur, turning to coat lightly. Dip one  side into sugar. Place cookie rounded side up with the sugared side against  the side of the pan. Repeat with as many ladyfingers as needed to cover  sides of pan. For bottom of pan, dip cookies in Grand Marnier only,  omitting sugar. Trim to fit.    Spoon half of the cheese and chocolate mixture into pan, smooth the top.  Sprinkle with half of the mixed berries. Top with more dipped ladyfingers,  covering berries completely and trimming to fit. Follow with remaining  cheese mixture. Top dessert with remaining berries. Cover; chill at least 6  hours, or overnight. Release pan sides and transfer cake to a serving  platter. Garnish with white chocolate curls, if desired.
