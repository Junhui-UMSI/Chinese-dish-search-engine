Potato "Pigs"
Cheddar cheese, White potatoes, Chives, Pretzel sticks, Ketchup, Sour cream, 
Place whole potatoes in sauce pan of cold water and bring to boil. Boil for  35 minutes, drain and cool. When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut in  half and hollow out potatoes inside, leaving 1/2 inch of potato in the  skin. Mash potatoes with sour cream, cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons  chives. Refill skins with potato mixture and put halves back together. Put  4 pretzel sticks on the bottom of each potato for legs. Make faces for the  pigs, with the remaining chives as eyes and ketchup for a smile. Stand the  pig up on its pretzel legs, and prepare to "pig" out!
