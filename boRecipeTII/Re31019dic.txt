Banana Oatmeal Bread
Boiling water; until room, Steel-cut oats; soaked in:, Brown sugar, Egg, Dried buttermilk, Banana; ripe; mashed, Salt, Flour; unbleached, Quick-cooking oats, Vegetable oil, Water, Active yeast, 
Place all the ingredients in the machine, program for Bread, Basic Bread,  Basic Wheat, Basic, White, White/Whold Grain, or Whte Bread, and press  Start or On.    Ive added all different kinds of dried fruit (apricots, dried cherries,  raisin s) to this and that comes out great.  Add 1/2 cup of chopped fruit  whenever you normally add raisins (if you have a raisin bread cycle then at  the beep. Thats my only complaint with the Panasonic--I think I did it  last time around 2:40 left in the whole wheat cycle, and it came out ok,  for those of you that also have the Panasonic).    >From: Joel.Ehrlich@salata.com (Joel Ehrlich)  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe    Recipe By     : Bread Machine Baking-Perfect Every Time,Brody & Apter p246
