Sifted confectioners sugar, Finely ground hazelnuts, Butter, Cream, Unsweetened Chocolate, 
From: lynx@netcom.com (Lynx-Amathon Adorienne) (collection)    Date: Fri, 30 Jul 1993 00:49:49 PDT  This is straight of of "The Joy of Cooking".  Very easy if you have a  microwave.    Coarsely grate chocolate [I broke into pieces].  Melt it with the butter.  Add cream.  Gradually stir in sugar and hazelnuts until lump-free.  [note:  sice I didnt have hazelnuts, I used some extra sugar.] Cover and  refrigerate 12 to 24 hours. [I could wait that long] Make individual balls  by rolling about a teaspoon of the mixture in the pl6am of the hand. This  friction and warmth will cause the chocolate to melt slightly, so that the  final coating will adhere. Roll balls in: cinnamon flavored cocao, or  Chocolate pastilles or shot [I used powered sugar with cinnamon, which I  thought was too sweet, and ground almonds, which were better]    This coating will stick to them very satisfactorily.  Keep refridgerated,  but for best flavor, remove 2 hours before serving.    [As I said, if you use a microwave, it takes about 90 seconds to melt the  chocolate and butter, starting with frozen butter.  An interesting  experiment, yet to be done, consists of replacing the cream with various  liquers: kaluha, ameretto, etc. ]    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
