Source : adapted from a recipe by Sherri Anski, an Israeli food journalist    Serves: I can polish off the whole pot myself, however serves about 10-12    1. Wash all vegetables well by immersing in water to remove grains of sand.  Open leeks and wash well the insides.    2. DO NOT CHOP leave vegetables. Peel and cut to 1/2 x1/2 inch cubes all  other vegetables. Cut carrots and leeks to rounds. Peel and cut celery  root. Do not chop leaves of celery either.    3. In a large pot, place on bottom bunches of parsley and dill. Arrange on  top celery leaves. On top of leaves arrange chicken. On top, arrange other  vegetables.    4. On top, spread chopped garlic. Add if desired salt and pepper.    5. Pour bottles of water on top.    6. Bring to boil, then simmer for about an 1 1/2 hour.    7. Just before serving add to served soup only lemon juice.    Notes:    1. Chicken can be served with soup. However I prefer to use it for chicken  fruit salads like the ones that were discussed here only a few weeks ago.    2. If made one day ahead, the fat in the soup can be trimmed.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Raya Tarab" <tarab@netvision.net.il> on  Aug 10, 1998,
