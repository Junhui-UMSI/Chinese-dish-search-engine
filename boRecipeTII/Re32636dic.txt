Sweet Pea Guacamole
Ground cumin, 1-inch square of red onion, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Fresh Lemon Juice, Salt, Jalape?o pepper, Frozen peas (not tiny ones), 
Cook peas according to package instructions.  For this recipe, the larger  peas work better than the tiny peas. Drain cooked peas and pat with paper  towelling to remove as much water as possible. If you want less "heat" in  the guacamole, seed the pepper and discard the seeds. Mince the pepper in a  food processor or blender. Add oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, and let  machine run until the pepper is more finely minced. Add peas, cumin, and  salt, and puree about 2 minutes, stopping several times to scrape down the  sides of the container. Transfer the puree to a small bowl. Cut the onion  into a small dice and add to the mixture. Adjust the seasoning with  additional lemon juice or salt if necessary. Cover tightly and chill  thoroughly up to 2 days before serving.
