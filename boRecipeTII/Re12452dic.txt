Combine all ingredients thoroughly by hand and shape  into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter.    Bring chicken broth to a boil and add chopped escarole. Reduce heat and  simmer gently for 5-8 minutes.    Drop the meatballs into the broth, a few at a time, and stir gently. Simmer  gently for 8-10 minutes.    In a thin, steady stream, slowly pour the Parmesan/egg mixture into the  simmering broth. Stir and simmer 1 minute.    Turn off heat and allow soup to settle for about 10-15 minutes before  serving.    Yield: 10-12 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 19, 1998
