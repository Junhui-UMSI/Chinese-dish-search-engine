Wash, stem and remoeve seeds from the chilies.  Put chiliesin 3 cups cold  water and bring to a boil. After about 45 minutes to an hour the skins  should slip off easily. Mash the pulp into a paste. If this seems too  difficult, you can substitute chili powder at the ratio of 1 tablespoon  chili powder to a pod of chili. Read the instructions on the soy or TVP  package to see if the product was soaked beforehand. If not, use some of  the water to prepare this ingredient. Saute the onions in the olive oil  until translucent. Add the garlic and spices , then the 12 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, then add the nuggets.  Reduce to a simmer, cook for 30  minutes to an hour.  If this seems too runny, you can thicken with masa,  the cornmeal flour used in tortillas. When made in bulk, this chili can  readily be frozen.    Total calories per serving: 163  Fat 4 grams    Source: Vegetarian Journal, Jan/Feb 1995 Poohs Recipe dbase  (lisa_pooh@delphi.com) 2/4/96
