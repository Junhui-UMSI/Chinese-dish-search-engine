Glace De Viande (Meat Glaze)
Brown Stock, 
Reduce the brown stock slowly until it forms an even coating on a spoon  inserted into it. Remove from heat and cool. Keep refrigerated until  needed. It may be cut into squares after cooling (each equivalent to 1  Tablespoon) and frozen for convenience.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 28, 98,
