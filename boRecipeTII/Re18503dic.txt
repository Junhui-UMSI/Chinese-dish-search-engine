Combine sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil,  stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer until all sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat and cool.     In an aging container, combine apricot halves, almond extract, grain  alcohol with 1/2 cup water, and brandy. Stir in cooled sugar syrup mixture.  Cap and let age for 2 days. Remove apricot halves. (Save apricot halves, as  they may be used for cooking). Add food coloring and glycerin. Stir, recap  and continue aging for 1 to 2 months.     Re-bottle as desired. Liqueur is ready to serve but will continue to  improve with additional aging.     Variation: For a more prominent bitter almond flavor, add 4 apricot  nuts,** split in half, to basic mixture. Leave in for 2 days to 2 weeks  depending upon depth of flavor desired. Remove and discard apricot nuts.  Continue as directed.     **Note: Apricot nuts come from within the apricot pit. You may split  pits yourself or obtain them dried at a health food store.    TREY@BIG-BIRD.CS.BERKELEY.EDU    (MACDONALD JACKSON)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
