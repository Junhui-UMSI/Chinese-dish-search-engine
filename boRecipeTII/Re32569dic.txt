Sweet Lassi #1
salt and pepper, Iced water, Sugar to taste, Yoghurt, 
There was a request made for Sweet Lussie, an East Indian drink.  I have  the recipe and the drink is wonderful!     Beat the yoghurt until smooth and add 1 pint iced water.  Add salt and  pepper and sugar to taste.  Very simple.    MEB9@PO.CWRU.EDU    (MOLLY WIGHT PATEL)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
