Virginia Spoon Bread #1
Salt, Baking Powder, Eggs, Milk; scalded, Cornmeal; white or yellow, 
Spoon bread is simply a very rich and dense corn bread, a dish so dense  that it must be served up with a spoon. General Washington loved this dish  and it was apparently served quite often at Mount Vernon.      Mix the cornmeal and salt together and stir them into the hot milk.  Cook  over very low heat, stirring all the time, until thick and smooth. Continue  cooking for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Stir in  the baking powder and well-beaten yolks, and fold in the stiffly beaten egg  whites. Turn into a greased casserole or 8-inch-square pan. Bake in a  moderate oven (375?) about 35 minutes, or until the bread is firm and the  crust is brown. Serve from the baking dish.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
