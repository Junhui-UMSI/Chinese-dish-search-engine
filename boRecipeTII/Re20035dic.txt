To make the cookies, sift the dry ingredients together. Gently warm the  syrup until hot and runny. Stir in the butter and, when melted, scrape into  a bowl. Mix in the dry ingredients to form a dough. Chill for 1 hour.    Preheat oven 375degF. Roll out chilled dough 1/4 inch thick. Cut out rounds  with a cookie cutter and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cook in a  preheated oven (375degF) for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and  cool on a wire rack.    2. To make the custard, heat the cream and vanilla beans in a saucepan.  Remove the beans, split them, scrape the seeds into the cream, then return  the beans to the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and infuse for 10  minutes.    Remove the beans. Beat the egg yolks and whole egg together, add the sugar,  and beat until pale and creamy. Stir in the cornstarch and beat in the  vanilla infused cream.    Preheat oven 325degF. Spoon the mixture into 6 small ovenproof dishes or  glasses, cover with foil or wax paper and place in a roasting pan half  filled with water. Cook in preheated oven (325degF) for 45 to 60 minutes  until just set and firm to the touch. Serve with the spicy biscuits, the  segmented oranges, if using, and a glass of sweet dessert wine.
