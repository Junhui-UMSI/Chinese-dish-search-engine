Add the banana, buttermilk, egg whites,a nd vanilla  extract, and stir to mix well.    Coat a 9 x 13" pan with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the batter evenly in  the pan. Bake at 350 deg F for about 35 min., or just until a wooden  toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake  to room temp.    To make the glaze, combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl. If using  a microwa e oven, microwave the glaze, uncovered, at high power for 35  seconds, or until runny. If using a conventional stove top, transfer the  glaze to a small saucepan and place over medium heat for 30 seconds,  stirring constantly. Drizzle the glaze over the cake, and let harden before  cutting into squares and serving. This is quick and really excellent  tasting.
