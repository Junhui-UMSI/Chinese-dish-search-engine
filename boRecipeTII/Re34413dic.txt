Bean Burritos #2
Minced garlic (to taste), Onion, Black beans, Black pepper, Cooked black beans -or-, Steamed rice, 
While in Key West over the summer I was fortunate enough to be exposed to  some amazing Cuban food.  When I returned home at the end of the summer I  applied these new ideas to my own kitchen.  My personal favorite is Black  beans, rice, and lettuce burritos!     Bring the black beans to a simmer in their own juices.  Use fresh garlic  and slice it very fine so it nearly dissappears when you add it to the  beans with the pepper After abouit five miuntes add the onions. When  serving use twice as much rice as beans and about a third as much lettuce,  all wrapped in a nice flour. tortilla.     Easy Huh?
