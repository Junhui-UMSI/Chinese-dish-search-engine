Place a pizza stone, baking tiles or an inverted baking sheet on the lowest  rack of a cold oven; preheat for 30 minutes to 500 F or the highest  setting.    Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a disk. Use a rolling  pin or your hands to roll or stretch the dough into a cicle that is 1/4  inch thick and 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Transfer to a semolina or  cornmeal dusted pizza peel or inverted baking sheet.    Brush the dough with a little of the olive oil. Spread tomato sauce over  the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Distribute olives, anchovies and  capers over the sauce. Sprinkle with cheese. Drizzle with the remaining  olive oil.    Carefully slide the pizza onto th heated pizza stone and bake for 6 to 8  minutes or until the bottom is crisp and browned and the top is bubbling.
