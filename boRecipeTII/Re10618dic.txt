Quick Pizza Dough
fast-acting yeast, unbleached flour, olive oil, Sugar, Salt, 
In a large bowl whisk together 3/4 cup of flour, yeast, sugar, and 2/3 cup  hot water (130 degrees F). Stir in the oil, 1 1/4 cups of the remaining  flour, and the salt and blend the mixture until it forms a dough. Knead the  dough on a floured surface, incorporating as much of the remaining      1/4    cup    flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking, for 5 to 10 minutes,  or until it is smooth and elastic.    Alternatively, the dough may be made in a food processor. In a food  processor combine 3/4 cup of the flour, yeast, and sugar. With the motor  running, add 2/3 cup hot water (130 degrees F), and turn t    he motor off. Add the oil, 1 1/4 cups of the remaining flour, and the salt  and process the mixture until it forms a ball, adding more water, 1  teaspoon at a time, if it is too dry, or more flour, 1 t    ablespoon at time, if it is too wet. Knead the dough by processing it for  15 seconds. The dough, prepared by either method, may be used immediately,  but for better flavor it is best to let it rise on    ce. Put the dough in an oiled bowl and turn it to coat it with the oil. Let  the dough rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 30 minutes,  or until it is double in bulk, and punch it down. This dough may be used  inste    ad of the basic pizza dough.    Yield: Makes enough dough for one 14-inch pizza or four 7-inch pizzas  Recipe By     : COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8750    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #277    Date: Mon, 4 Nov 1996 14:52:51 -0500    From: "Angele and Jon Freeman" <jfreeman@netusa1.net>
