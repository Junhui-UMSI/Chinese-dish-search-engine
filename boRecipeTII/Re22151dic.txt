Turkey Orloff From Julia Child and Company Pt 2
See part 1, 
each, as you go, with the soubise. Spoon remaining mushroom duxelles down  the sides. Spoon remaining sauce over the turkey and spread the mozzarella  cheese on top. Recipe may be prepared a day in advance to this point; when  cool, cover and refrigerate. If, before proceeding, you note that the sauce  does not cover some parts of the meat, spreat more mozzarella on these  areas.    Final baking and serving: Turkey will take about 25 minutes to heat and for  the top to brown; it should be served fairly promptly since the meat will  be juicier if it does not have to wait around. Set uncovered in upper third  of a preheated 400 degree oven until contents are bubbling hot and sauce  has browned nicely.
