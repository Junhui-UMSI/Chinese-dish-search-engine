Pineapple Lime Salad
Boiling water, Pecans, Crushed pineapple, Cream; whipped, Lime jello, Cream cheese, 
Dissolve jello in water. Let it cool slightly but do not let it set. With a  fork, mash cream cheese into jello liquid until it is all in small pieces.  Add pineapple & nuts. Fold in whipped cream. Pour into a 9x12-inch pan &  refrigerate. Cut into squares when serving. A small dab of mayonnaise on  each square makes each salad more attractive.    MRS H.G. (NELLE) HALL, JR.
