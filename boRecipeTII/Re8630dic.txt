A little cooking oil, 
Any kind of beef, lamb/mutton, chicken, even fish. Cheaper cuts of meat are  better as this dish is cooked for hours Thickly slice any kind of  vegetables that are available. Pumpkin, squash, zucchini are good,  potatoes, yams, tomatoes, beans etc Wine (red or white) for cooking (and  drinking) Whatever spices and herbs are around. Salt & pepper, coriander is  good, tumeric, curry if you like etc    This is a traditional dish, which can be made using just about anything to  hand. Great for a cookout on a summers day. Requires a lot of time, and  lots of wine to drink while youre waiting. The recipe really depends on  what you have and therefore is almost never the same twice.    Utensil: A large iron pot, preferably with three legs. It must have a  tightly fitting lid.    Method: Make a little fire. It must be very low. Brown chunks of meat or  chicken in the pot. Then pack the meat at the bottom of the pot. In layers  pack the other sliced vegetables, potatoes should be at the top, seasoning  each layer as you pack it in. Pour wine over the layers.    Cook this over the very low fire for 4 to 6 hours without stirring, sipping  wine with your friends while you solve the worlds problems and while they  tll you what youve left out of the pot. Now and then add a bit of wine  knowingly to the pot, just to make your friends think you know what youre  doing.    Serve over rice and youll realize that life is good when you do things  this slowly.    Posted to rec.food.recipes by japlady@nwu.edu (Rebecca Radnor) on 1995, .
