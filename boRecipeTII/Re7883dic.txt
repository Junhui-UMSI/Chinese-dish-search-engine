Traditionally, you spoon the seasonings on top: mixtures such as green  tomatillos pureed with pumpkin seeds, pureed soaked red ancho chiles, or  smoky chipotles pounded with roasted tomatoes ... [read be creative with  this...]    If using dried hominy, soak it in water to cover for eight hours or  overnight. Drain. Place in a large pot with water to cover; simmer 2 to 3  hours, or so until tender. Taste as you go since some posole cooks quicker  than others.    If using canned posole, simply open the cans and drain.    Combine the meats, bouillon cubes, garlic, onions, bay leaves, and water in  a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a low simmer. Spoon off  any scum that comes to the top. Cookj over low heat for about 2 hours, then  add the chicken. Simmer for another 1.5 to 2.5 hours, or until the meats  are very tender, the chicken tender but not falling apart, and the broth  extremely flavorful.    About 30 minutes before the broth is ready, add the hominy.    Serve the posole in bowls; a few big spoonfuls of hominy, the rich broth, a  chunk or two of the various meats. Have an array of condiments on the table  for each diner to add to their bowl.  Serves 8 to 10.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
