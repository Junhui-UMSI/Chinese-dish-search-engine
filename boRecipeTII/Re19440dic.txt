These egg rolls make an excellent first course, or when eaten right with  the cooked rice, a whole meal. Just be sure, if you eat them without rice,  that you include rice in the meal to complement the soybeans.    In a wok or frying pan saute the vegetables in sesame oil in the order  given.  After the onion has started sauteing, add the remaining vegetables  quickly so that the total time with the heat on is about 5 minutes. As soon  as you add the bean sprouts to the pan, turn off the heat.    Stir the pureed soybeans and soy sauce together.  Then stir this mixture  into the vegetables.    The whole mixture may be chilled several hours, or used warm. To prepare  the rolls: place about 1/4 cup filling in the center of each pancake or egg  roll wrapper; fold the corners over envelope-style and seal with a  flour-water paste.    Heat a large frying pan with oil in the bottom.  Fry the rolls until they  are crisp and brown, turning only once. You may deep fry the rolls if you  are into deep frying, but they are better cooked only in a little oil.  Drain on paper bags or towels.    Keep the rolls hot in a 250~ oven up to an hour.  Or reheat them at 450~  for about 10 minutes.    Serve 2 egg rolls with about 1 cup of cooked rice and any of the following:  mustard, horseradish, soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or hot sauce.
