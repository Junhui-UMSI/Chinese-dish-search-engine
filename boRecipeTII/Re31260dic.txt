I have a receipe for Banana-Walnut Bread which I found in my Better Homes &  Gardens Bread Machine Bounty. Add ingredients to machine according to  manufactrers directions, adding the banana with the milk. (Use light  setting, if available.)    I have not tried this receipe yet so let me know if its good or not.    Posted on PRODIGY* in December of 1993; Formatted by Elaine Radis; PRODIGY,  BGMB90B; GEnie, E.RADIS     --
