Acadian Peppered Shrimp
Fresh oregano; chopped, Large raw shrimp in shells, Fresh cracked black pepper, Fresh basil; chopped, Garlic, Cayenne pepper, Black pepper; finely ground, Butter, Bay leaf; crumbled, Lemon juice, Kosher salt to taste, 
Start with 4 pounds of fresh shrimp (26/30). Melt the butter in a large  saute pan over low heat. When melted, raise the heat, and add the remaining  ingredients. (except the shrimp) Cook, stirring often, until browned to a  rich mahogany color, about 12 minutes. Add the shrimp, stirring and turning  to coat well with the seasoned butter. Cook until the shrimp have turned  pink, about 10 minutes. Serve the shrimp in their shells, peeling them at  the table.    >Inspired by a recipe from Nathalie Duprees "New Southern Cooking"    Notes: The Kitchen Table BBS - http://www.mindsync.com/ChefJeff A great  recipe for those hot summer days when the stove puts off way to much heat  for comforts sake. This is quick, delicious and goes wonderfully well with  a nice pasta salad and a couple of ice cold beers.
