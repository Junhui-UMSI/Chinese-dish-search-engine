Barbecued Baked Beans
1      s mall         hot, 2      t ablespoons   chili, 1      t easpoon      salt, 2      c ups          dried, 1/2  c up           onion;, 3/4  c up           tomato, 8      s lices, 2      t ablespoons, 1 generous dash hot pepper, 2      t ablespoons   corn, 
Soak beans overnight in cold water to cover. Fry bacon until crisp. Drain  drippings from bacon into baking dish or small bean pot. Add all remaining  ingredients to fat and blend. Drain beans and add to mixture. Blend.  Crumble the crisp bacon over top. Add water just to cover beans. Cover dish  or bean pot and bake at 325 degrees F. for 2 hours. Add more hot water if  needed. Uncover beans during last 20 to 30 minutes. Serve from baking dish.    A slice of smoky bacon rind used instead of the sliced bacon will give a  more decidedly country flavor. Brown sugar to taste may replace the corn  syrup. And canned tomatoes may take the place of the catsup -- but if so,  correct the seasoning as necessary with a little sugar, salt, cayenne and a  pinch of ground allspice.
