Apricot Almond Meringue Cookies
Salt; or cream of tartar, Vanilla extract, Dried apricots; finely diced, Slivered almonds; lightly, Egg whites; at room, Sugar; superfine, 
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Lightly grease two cookie sheets or, if  you prefer, grease parchment or waxed paper spread on cookie sheets.    In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with the salt or cream of tartar until  the whites make soft peaks. To make a tender meringue, gradually add all  but 2 tablespoons of the sugar as you continue to beat. Check to see if the  sugar has dissolved by pinching the meringue. When you can no longer feel  the crystals, fold in the remaining sugar, then the vanilla extract, and  finally the apricots and almonds.    Drop neat spoonfuls of the meringue batter onto the cookie sheets; give  them attractive peaks, as they will not spread or change their shape. Bake  for 1hour without opening the door. Turn off the oven and keep them in the  unopened oven for at least another hour or as long as overnight. Remove the  cookies with a spatula. Store them in airtight tins or, closed tightly in a  plastic bag, in the freezer, where they will keep indefinitely.    NOTES : These light, tender meringue cookies are a good way to use up extra  egg whites.
