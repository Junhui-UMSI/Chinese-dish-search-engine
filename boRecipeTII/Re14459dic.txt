If the latter, reduce oven heat 25 degrees. This loaf has a  tendency to stick in the pan. Line the bottom (and the sides, if you wish)  with a piece of wax paper which is coated lightly with oil or butter.    Preparation: In a bowl sift or stir together the flour, baking soda, salt,  nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon. Measure in the whole wheat. In a separate  bowl cream the butter and sugar. Break in one egg at a time, beating each  well. Alternately, pour and stir the milk and the dry ingredients into the  bowl with the egg mixture. Add vanilla. Beat until the mixture is smooth,  and add walnuts.    Forming: Pour batter into pan. Push the batter into the corners and leave a  slight depression down the center to offset oven expansion. Set aside for 5  minutes while the oven preheats to 350 degrees.    Baking: 1 hour. Place pan in oven and bake until the crust is deep brown.  Test with a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf. If it  comes out clean and dry, the bread is baked. If batter clings to the pick,  return the loaf to the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Test again.    Final Step: Remove bread from the oven. (This loaf is fragile when first  taken from the oven.) Leave in the pan for 5 or 10 minutes, then turn the  pan on its side and gently pull out the loaf by tugging on the wax paper or  coaxing it with a metal spatula.    From: Clayton, Bernard. (1973).
