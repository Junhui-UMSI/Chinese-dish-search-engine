Add the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla  and beat well. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well on low speed if  using a mixer. Try not to incorporate too much air. Two ways to bake this:  either pour over and bake in your favorite crust (which has already been  lightly baked) or put in a 9" springform pan and nest inside another pan.  Bake at 375 for about 1 hour, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.  Turn off the oven and let the cake cool for an hour in it (leave door  open).  Let it sit an additional hour or two until it comes to room  temperature, then cover and refrigerate at least 5 hours. This sets up so  well;its the closest lower fat version of New York style cheesecake I have  been able to come up with (hint, hint, if someone can top this).
