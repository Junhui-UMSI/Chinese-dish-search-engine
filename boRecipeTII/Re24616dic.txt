Sautee pine nuts in a small skillet over medium heat 2-3 minutes, until  browned. Set aside.    Combine olive oil and remaining ingredients in a medium saucepan; stir with  a wire whisk to blend. Cook over medium heat 2-3 minutes or until  thoroughly heated, stirring constantly. Pour over asparagus. Sprinkle with  pine nuts. Let stand to room temperature before serving.
