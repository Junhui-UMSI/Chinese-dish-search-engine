In a mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in  eggs, one at a time, until batter is smooth. Add vanilla, anise, lemon rind  and juice, flour, baking powder and salt. Beat just until thoroughly  blended. Mix in walnuts. Cover and chill dough at least 4 hours. Divide  dough into several portions. On a lightly floured board, roll dough into  logs about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and the length of the baking sheet.    Bake logs, spaced 2 to 3 inches apart, in a pre-heated 325-degree oven for  30 minutes, or until golden and firm to the touch. Remove from oven and let  cool for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 300-degrees.    Cut logs in 3/4 inch thick slices. Place slices, cut side down, on baking  sheets. Bake for 15 minutes, until biscotti are dry. Cool on wire racks.    May be stored in an airtight container for several weeks. Makes 8 dozen. **  Recipe taken from Chicago-Sun Times Food section,     11/22/92.
