This is a really refreshing summer dessert PUT RASPBERRIES IN A POT  WITH THE WATER HEAT GENTLY TIL BERRIES ARE MELTED, THEN SIMMER FOR 10 MIN  UNTIL THE FRUIT IS VERY SOFT.  ADD SUGAR & SIMMER AGAIN TIL DISSOLVED.  STRAIN THROUGH FINE SIEVE, PRESSING WITH A WOODEN SPOON (TO GET AS MUCH  JUICE AS POSSIBLE). ADD CASSIS & TASTE FOR SWEETNESS ADD MORE SUGAR IF  DESIRED. REHEAT JUICE TIL ALMOST BOILING. SOFTEN GELATINE IN 1/2 CUP COLD  WATER & STIR INTO JUICES. STIR UNTIL DISSOLVED. POUR INTO LARGE BOWL OF  JELLY MOULD. SET IN A COLD PLACE. UNMOULD JUST BEFORE SERVING. THIS IS A  VERY RICH FLAVOURED JELLY SO SMALL HELPINGS ARE ALL THAT IS NEEDED. 8  SERVINGS.
