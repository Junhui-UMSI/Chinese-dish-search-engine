Freeze meat 1 hour to firm (makes slicing easier); slice into very thin  strips. Combine remaining ingredients except rice; pour over steak.  Marinate 2 hours.   Thread meat on 4 skewers. Broil about 4 inches from heat  until desired doneness (5-10 minutes), brushing with marinade and turning  once. Heat remaining marinade; thicken if desired. Serve with meat and  rice.
