Tuna Steak Marinade
Lemon juice, Worcestershire Sauce, Garlic, Hot sauce, Butter, 
Grill or Broil basting with remaining marinade. Cook fish 4 - 6 minutes on  each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.      I cooked this on a stove top grill constantly basting.   If cooked too long  it becomes too dry.    Meal Mastered by Stuart Talkofsky from a bag of tuna steaks.
