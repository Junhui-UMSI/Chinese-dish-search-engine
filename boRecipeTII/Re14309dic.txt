White-Simmered Roast Duck
Duck; 6 to 7 pounds, Salt, Water, Head Chinese cabbage, Fresh ginger root, 
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wipe duck with a damp cloth, then dry well  with paper toweling. Truss duck (see "HOW-TO SECTION").     2. Place duck on a rack over a drip pan containing several inches of  water. Roast until lightly browned (about 20 minutes).     3. Transfer duck to a heavy pan. Mince ginger root and add with water and  salt. Bring to a boil; then simmer, covered, 1 hour. (If duck becomes too  dry, add more boiling water.) Skim off fat.     4. Cut Chinese cabbage stems in 2-inch pieces. Place on top of duck and  simmer 1 hour more.     NOTE: If the dish is prepared through step 3, then refrigerated, the fat  will congeal and can be removed easily. The duck is then reheated and the  cabbage added as in step 4.
