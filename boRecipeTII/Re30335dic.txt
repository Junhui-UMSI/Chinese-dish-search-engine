Remove from oven and allow to cool briefly.  Spray a 9x9" baking  dish with the nonstick spray, and set aside.  In the bowl of a food  processor or blender, combine the cocoa, sugar, bananas, nonfat dry milk,  salt, egg whites and skim or lowfat milk, and vanilla. Puree to make a  smooth liquid. Pour the banana cocoa mixture over the toasted bread cubes,  and press the cubes to coat evenly. Bake for 25 minutes or until firm.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Serve warm with the low fat  vanilla yogurt, or any flavor you like that wont overpower the taste of the  bread pudding. serves 8 165 calories, 1 gm fat, 32.7 gms carbohydrates,  3mg,  sodium, 263 mg    EAT-L Digest 12 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
