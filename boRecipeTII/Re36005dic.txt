Freeze immediately for 10 to 12 hours  before removing packages from the pans.    TO HEAT FROZEN FOOD:  Preheat oven to 375? F. (hot).  Remove freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan.  Bake 1 hour or until center is hot.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #184    Date: Mon, 05 Aug 1996 11:22:43 -0500    From: "R.
