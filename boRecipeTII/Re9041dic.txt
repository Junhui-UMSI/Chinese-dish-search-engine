Primo Fudge
Chocolate chips; melted, Pecans, Powdered sugar, Unsweetend chocolate; melted, Vanilla, Cream cheese, Sweetened condensed milk or, Butter, Honey, 
This rivals Fanny Farmer even.    Combine cheese, sugar, butter, honey,  vanilla, condensed milk; blend smoothly. Quickly add melted chocolate and  nuts. Place into buttered pan. Spread about 1" thick. Chill; cut into  squares.    As a variation I have chilled the fudge a bit then, with  buttered hands, scoop out some of it, make a log and roll it in chopped  pecans. PRIMO STUFF!
