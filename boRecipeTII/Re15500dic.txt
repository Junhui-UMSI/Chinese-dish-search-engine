40-Second Omelet
Eggs, Butter; or 1 teaspoon oil, Water, 
Beat together eggs and water until blended. In a 10-inch omelet pan heat  butter until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Pour in egg  mixture. Mixture should set immediately at edges. With an inverted pancake  turner, carefully push cooked portions at edges toward center so uncooked  portions can reach hot pan surface, tilting pan and moving as necessary.  Continue until the egg is set and will not flow.    Fill the omelet with 1/2 cup of desired mixture. With a pancake turner,  fold omelet in half. Invert onto plate and serve immediately.    Yield: 1 serving    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8928 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #720 by  "Angele and Jon Freeman" <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Aug 4, 1997
