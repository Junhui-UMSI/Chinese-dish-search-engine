Cream of tartar, Vanilla extract, Egg whites, Flour; Whole Wheat Pastry, Unsweetened cocoa powder, Sugar, Lemon Extract, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the flour, cocoa, and 1/4 cup of the  sugar in a sifter, sift into a medium bowl. Repeat the sifting 5 times. Set  aside. Sift the remaining 1 cup of sugar into a seperate bowl. Set aside.  Place the eggwhites in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat until  foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until the egg whites form stiff  peaks but are not dry. Fold in the 1 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Add the vanilla and lenon extract. Slowly sift small amounts of the flour  mixture over the batter and fold it in until all flour is incorporated.  Pour the batter into an ungreased 10" straight-sided tube pan. Bake       45    minutes. Remove from the oven and turn upside down to cool. Let  stand for 11/2 hours. (Invert pan over kneck of a sturdy bottle to prevent  cake from shrinking as it cools.) When the cake is fully cooled, run a  knife around the edges of the pan to remove cake.
