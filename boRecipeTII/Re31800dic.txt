Blend thoroughly. Cover  and set aside. Do not refrigerate.    To make noodles, cook fettuccine until tender. While noodles are still  warm, toss with oil until well coated. Chill. Place carrots in sieve and  pour boiling water over them. Immediately pat dry with paper towels and  chill. Wrap julienned green onions, ham, bean sprouts, cucumber and red  pepper separately and chill until serving time. Bring noodles to room  temperature before serving. At serving time, place noodles in center of  large round bowl or platter. Arrange vegetables and ham attractively in  separate mounds around edge.
