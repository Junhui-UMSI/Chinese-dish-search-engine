Swedish Coffee Ring / Swedish Christmas Crown - Abm
Ground cardamom, Butter, Salt, Chopped blanched almonds, Water, Bread machine yeast, Lemon Peel, Bread flour, Chopped citron, Eggs, Food coloring, Granulated sugar, DOUGH, Green & red candied cherries, Saffron* or 2-3drops yellow, GLAZE, 10X sugar - plain flavor, Water + as needed, 10X Lemon flavored sugar, 
Place all the dough ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order  recommended by the manufacturer, EXCEPT the citron, almonds and lemon peel.    Process on Dough/Manual cycle. DO NOT USE THE DELAY CYCLE. According to  your machine add the citron, almonds and lemon peel at the raisin or nuts  signal beep or 5 minutes before last kneading cycle ends.    Grease a large cookie sheet. (I prefer the air-cushion type as it doesnt  over brown the bottom of the bread.)    Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 30-inch rope on a lightly  floured pastry board. Place ropes close together on the prepared cookie  sheet. Twist the ropes over each other gently and then loosely into a  circle. Press the ends together to seal. Cover and allow to rise in a warm  place 45-50 minutes or until double in size.    Heat oven to 375 degrees F . Bake ring 20-25 minutes or until golden brown;  cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Garnish with cherries if desired.    Glaze: With a fork blend the sugars together. All of one flavor can be used  if desired.  Add water and mix until smooth and thin enough to drizzle over  the cake. Add or decrease water accordingly.    *To make a SWEDISH CHRISTMAS CROWN: After bread has cooled, make holes for  6 candles in bread. Drizzle with glaze. Garnish with cherries and insert  candles.
