Cook sausage meat about half done, breaking it into small pieces. Add  onion, celery and seasonings and continue to cook until the meat is tender.  Drain off surplus fat. Combine sausage mixture with bread crumbs and sweet  potatoes. Mix thoroughly.     This stuffing is especially good in fowl, in a stuffed roast shoulder of  pork or in pockets cut in thick pork chops.    From <A Taste of Louisiana>.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
