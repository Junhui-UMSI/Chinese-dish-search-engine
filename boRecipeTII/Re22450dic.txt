Recipe by: Evan Kleiman 1996, Pizzeria (Sunset) For the bread, youll need  1 small loaf good quality country bread w/firm crumb (La Bread Boule).  Select large sweet vine ripe tomatoes.    The day before you wish to make the soup slice bread in half then place eac  bread half cut side down and cut into 1/2 inch slices. Set aside on a  counter...do not wrap. Let the bread get a bit stale overnight.    Place the cup of olive oil in a large heavy soup pot. Add the chopped  tomatoes and sage and cook over moderate heat until tomatoes break down and  become saucy. Meanwhile cut the stale bread slices into large cubes. Add  them to the tomato-sage sauce and barely cover with water or broth. Bring t  a rolling boil, cover then turn the heat off. Let the bread-tomato mixture  sit, covered for at least 2 hours. Lift the cover to stir occasionally.    After the mixture has been soaking again bring it to a simmer over  moderately low heat, stirring vigorously to break down the bread. Let simme  just until the soup is a very thick mush. Serve hot or at room temperature  with additional extra-virgin olive oil drizzled on top.
