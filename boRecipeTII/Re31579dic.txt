Crush grains and steep for 30 minutes in water at 158 deg.  Strain  into  boiling  vessel  and sparge with 158 degrees water. Add  malt  extracts,  dextrin,  honey, brown sugar, molasses and gypsum and bring to  a  boil.  Add boiling hops 5 minutes into boil, Irish moss for the last 15 minutes  and finishing hops in last 5 minutes. Total boil of 50 minutes.  Cool to at  least 68 degrees before pitching yeast. Prime with dextrose as usual.  Although I tend towards all grain brewing it seems I always come back to  this one as my Porter. The rich body and residual sweetness of this beer is  something  which  I have found hard to replicate  in  an  all  grain  recipe.  This  beer  finished  2nd  at  the  Canadian  Amateur   Brewers  Association national competition in 1989 and a variation of this  recipe  finished  3rd  in  1990. The yeast strain is critical  as  well  as  the  molasses to get the most out of this beer.
