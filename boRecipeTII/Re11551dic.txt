Raspberry Green Beans
Fresh Green Beans; Rinsed In, Raspberries, Raspberry Vinegar, 
Place raspberries in pot with just enough water so the berries float. Place  a metal steamer in the pot and bring water to boil. Splash vinegar over the  steamer. Add green beans and cook, covered, for about 5 minutes or just  until beans are bright green. Remove from heat and place beans in a  strainer. Pour cooking liquid over beans so that raspberry pieces mingle  with the beans. Serve immediately.
