By CATHY THOMAS The Orange County Register    A beat-the-clock soup that tastes like it took hours to prepare. In a large  pot, combine three cups nonfat milk, two baking potatoes (peeled and  diced), one teaspoon pureed chipotles and two 15-ounce cans creamed corn.  Simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, 12-14 minutes. Add 1 pound peeled  and deveined shrimp and cook two minutes. Season to taste with salt and  white pepper.
