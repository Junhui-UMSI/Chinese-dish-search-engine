Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" at 11 oclock. Select "sweet bread" and push Start.    In hot, humid or very cold weather, reduce water to 1-1/3 c.    Tested in DAK 1-1/2 lb R2D2 bread machine.  Sylvias comment: a heavy,  dense, easy to slice bread.  A little "wet," otherwise great!
