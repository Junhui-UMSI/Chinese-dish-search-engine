Cook together the molasses, brown sugar, hot water and beaten eggs. Mix  together the rest of the ingredients as you would for a cake batter. Divide  the batter among 4 unbaked pie shells. Pour the previously prepared syrup  over the batter and bake it at 400 oF for about 10 minutes, then reduce the  heat to 350 oF and bake it until done.
