Crust:  Beat egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until foamy. Add  sugar, 2 tbsp at a time, beating well after each addition. Then continue  beating to very still peaks.  Fold in the confectioners sugar, then the  vanilla and nuts.  Spoon into a lightly greased 8-inch pie plate to form a  nest-like shell; build sides up an inch above the edge of the pan. Bake in  a slow (300 F) oven for 50 to 55 minutes, checking it after about 45  minutes.  Remove it from the oven and allow to cool. (As it cools, the  meringue will fall, forming a pie crust.)    Filling:  Stir chocolates together with the water over very low heat, or in  the top of a double boiler until they melt; cool until thickened. Add the  vanilla.  Whip cream until stiff peaks form, then fold in the chocolate  mixture.  Pile into the shell and chill for 2 hours.    Topping:  Add sweetened whipped cream on top of the pie and sprinkle with  chocolate jimmies.
