Yogurt N Peaches Chicken
Cinnamon sugar, Plain yogurt, skinless chicken, Herb stuffing mix, peaches, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    In a food processor or blender, reduce the stuffing mix to coarse crumbs  and pour them onto a sheet of wax paper.    Coat one piece of chicken breast with yogurt as thickly as possible, then  dip it into the crumbs to coat.    Lay the chicken in an oiled baking dish large enough to hold chicken and  peaches in one layer. Repeat with the remaining chicken.    Surround the chicken with the peach halves, cut side down.    Sprinkle the peaches (not the chicken) with cinnamon sugar. Bake for 20  minutes, or until the breasts are just cooked through but not dry.
