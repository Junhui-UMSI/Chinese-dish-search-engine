The Story: The cultivation of vegetables in Aargau is one of the main  reasons for the existence of a thriving canning/bottling industry. In this  area, the carrot is the Queen of all vegetables and it has attributes which  allow it to be used everywhere, even in desserts.    This carrot cake is now a Swiss classic, its reputation having been  extended long ago far beyond the borders of the canton. Some maintain that  the cake is better two days after baking as the carrots keep it moist.    The Recipe: Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice and lemon  zest, until light. Add the finely grated carrots and the almonds.    Mix in the cornflour, cinnamon, ground cloves and baking powder. Then add  the kirsch. Mix or beat until smooth. Beat the egg whites until stiff and  carefully fold in.    Butter a tin (24 cm diameter, 5 cm high), dust with flour. Turn the  mixture into the tin. Bake in the oven for 50 ... 60 minutes at 180 oC.  When cooked, brush the cake with a hot apricot glaze and thin fondant  icing. Decorate with small marzipan carrots.
