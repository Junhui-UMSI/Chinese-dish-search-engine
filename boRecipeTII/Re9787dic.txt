*NOTE: Original recipe called for 2 regular eggs    **NOTE: Original recipe used 1/4 C oil...I reduced it and it can probably  still be reduced further    ***NOTE: Original recipe used 3/4 C chopped walnuts    Preheat oven to 350 deg F. Spray a 9 x 5" loaf pan with nonstick spray. In  large bowl, mix first 5 ingredients. In medium bowl, beat eggs, pumpkin,  brown sugar, syrup and oil. Gently stir pumpkin mixture into flour mixture.  Stir in raisins and walnuts.    Spoon batter into loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour, or until inserted toothpick  comes out clean. Cool bread in loaf pan; turn out of pan to wrap or serve.    This was quite good. Be sure to check it in a couple of places with a  toothpick or it might have a mushy surprise for you in the middle!!
