Very Special Pear Marmalade
Juice of 3 lemons, pears, ginger in syrup, Sugar, 
1- Put pears in a heavy stainless steel or enamel pan - the heavier the  better.  Add sugar and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil and stir until the  sugar has dissolved, about 5 min.   2 - Dice the pieces of preserved ginger to match the pear pieces as nearly  as you can.  Add the syrup and the ginger to the pears.   3 - Simmer until the pears become transparent and turn the color of the  ginger, 20-25 min.  Do not take the marmalade higher than 220 degrees on  the candy thermometer; it will thicken more as it cools.   4 - Spoon into sterilized jars or small jars.  Cool, refrig- erate. Or  spoon into freezer jars leaving 1" space. Cool and freeze. Makes 3 pints.    The pears and ginger dont have to be precise, but it does look prettier.  Select hard pears such as Kieffer or Seckel.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #194 by "Griff" <wgriffin@ix.netcom.com> on  Jul 27, 1997
