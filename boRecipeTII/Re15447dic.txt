Grease 2 heavy large cookie sheets. Mix first 4  ingredients together in a small bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat butter,  sugar and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in egg. Stir  in dry ingredients, then vanilla milk chips and nuts. Drop cookie dough by  scant 1/4 cupfuls onto prpared cookie sheets, spacing evenly. Bake until  golden brown, about 15 mins. Cool cookies on sheets for 5 mins. Transfer  cookies to rack to cool. This makes about 18.    This recipe from the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in L.A. Tips: Dont let  the cookies get too brown. They should still be very soft when removed from  oven. And for those of you who didnt know: Nestles now makes vanilla milk  chips along with their chocolate and butterscotch.
