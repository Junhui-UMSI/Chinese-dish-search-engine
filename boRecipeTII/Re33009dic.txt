Basic Cannelloni Crepes
Eggs, Water, All-purpose flour, Salt, Peanut oil, 
Place the eggs in a blender.  Add the water, flour, and salt.  Blend until  smooth.  Scrape down the sides of the container and blend again.  Heat a  10" nonstick frying pan and lightly oil the pan, using a paper towel. Ladle  1/4 cup of the batter into the pan and quickly turn the pan to evenly coat  the bottom with batter. Cook on one side only until dry on the top, about  one minute. These should be only very lightly browned and not too dry, so  the pan should not be too hot. Lightly oil the pan before cooking each  crepe.  Separate the crepes with wax paper until ready to use. The noodles  can be refrigerated overnight if you seal them in a plastic bag.
