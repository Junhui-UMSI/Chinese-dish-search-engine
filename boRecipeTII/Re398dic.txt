Lemon Cookies
Egg, Sugar, Grated lemon rind*, Pure lemon extract, Baking Powder, All-purpose flour, 
Directions:    Preheat oven to 325? F. Line cookie sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.  Break the egg into a medium-size mixing bowl and whip until frothy. Add the  sugar and mix until the sugar is completely dissolved. Beat in the lemon  zest, lemon extract and baking powder. Slowly beat in the flour until you  have a smooth mixture. Drop the dough by tablespoons onto the foil-lined  cookie sheet and bake in the preheated oven until the cookies start to  color, about 14 minutes. Allow cookies to cool completely before peeling  them off the foil. Makes 16 cookies.    *Be careful to grate only the outer yellow part of the rind. The inside can  be bitter.    Note: For faster preparation, omit the lemon rind and add another 1/2  teaspoon of lemon extract.

Have also  substituted egg replacer for whole egg. Have not tried substituting only  egg whites. Got good results with both substitutions.
