Puree until very smooth and as the machine is running, slowly  pour the olive oil into the running machine. Strain through a large holed  sieve into a glass bowl and chill for 4 hours.    Grilled Vegetable Soup: Preheat the grill. Toss all the vegetables in the  olive oil and season. Carefully grill all the vegetables making sure to get  grill marks (thats where the flavor is). Set aside to cool. When cool  enough, cut all into uniform small dice. Add to the soup base and adjust  the seasonings.    Black Bean Relish: Combine all of the ingredients and chill until ready to  serve.    Ladle the soup into 8 bowls and serve with the black bean relish.    This recipe yields 8 servings.
