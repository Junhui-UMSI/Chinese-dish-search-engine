Prepare the vegetables by slicing the carrots, fennel, celery and pepper  into small sticks. Cut the large tomatoes into sections if using. Trim the  roots and dark green leaves from the spring onions. Arrange the vegetables  on a large platter, leaving a space in the centre for the dip. Make the dip  by pouring the olive oil into a small bowl.  Add salt and pepper. Stir in  the lemon  juice and basil, if using.  Place the bowl in the centre of the  vegetable platter.

The vegetables should be raw or lightly       blanched, and the olive oil of the best quality available.
