Three Cheese Cannelloni
Mozzarella cheese, Chopped parsley, Cannelloni, Grated Parmesan cheese, Eggs, Salt, Ragu sauce, Ricotta cheese, Nutmeg, 
Mozzarella cheese (use 2/3 of this at least 1 c. in stuffing) Parboil  cannelloni for 3 to 4 minutes, cooking 6 at a time. Remove with tongs and  place on waxed paper. Combine cheese, parsley, salt, nutmeg and egg; mix  lightly with a fork. Stuff parboiled cannelloni with this mixture, using a  small knife or seafood fork. Cover bottom of 2 or 3 baking dishes with Ragu  sauce; arrange cannelloni so not touching. Cover with remaining Ragu;  sprinkle with remaining Mozzarella. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes at 350  degrees. Can be frozen. Serves 5 to 6. Note: I use 3 pans, putting 5 in  each and freeze all. One serves Kirk and me (3 for him and 2 for me).
