This  simple, delicious oven-roasted chicken oozes with tart, citrusy flavors.  This makes a nice dish for a buffet and helps make use of the summer  zucchini glut!    Pat zucchini "spaghetti" dry and toss with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.    Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.    Lightly flour chicken breasts and shake off excess. Season with salt and  pepper. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to an oven proof saute pan and  lightly brown on both sides. Remove from pan and set aside. Add  remainingoil, leeks and garlic and saute over moderate heat for 3 - 4  minutes or until vegetables are just beginning to soften. Add wine and  stock and cook over moderate heat for 3 - 4 minutes to reduce liquid  slightly.      Return chicken to pan and place some of the leeks mixture on top of  breasts. Season lightly and sprinkle lime zest, juice, parsley and sundried  tomatoes over and around breasts. Place pan uncovered in a preheated  400degree oven and bake for 5 - 7 minutes or until breasts are just done.    Halfway through the baking of the breasts, place the zucchini on a separate  baking sheet and bake until zucchini just begins to soften.    To serve: Arrange zucchini attractively on warm plates and top with breasts  and vegetables. Drizzle pan juices over. Garnish with zucchini flowers.  Serve hot or at room temperature.
