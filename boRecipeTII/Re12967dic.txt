Cookie Pastry: Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2  minutes.  Add egg and flour and mix until smooth dough is formed. With  hands, shape into a ball and flatten into a disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and  refrigerate until chilled.    Preheat oven to 350.    Make pastry and roll or press dough evenly over bottom and up sides of  9-inch pie pan.    Melt butter in microwave; set aside.  Whisk eggs and sugar in medium-size  bowl until blended.  Add peel and slowly stir in butter and lemon juice  until incorporated. Pour into crust. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until top  of custard is lightly browned. It will not test clean and will look  underdone, but will set as it cools. When cool, refrigerate. Before  serving, sprinkle powdered sugar on top.    Recipe By     :
