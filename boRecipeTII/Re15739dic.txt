Abalone Casserole
Bread crumbs, Or 2 sm. abalones or 4 to 6, (small) Ortega green, Cheddar cheese or a mixture, Eggs, Green onion; chopped, 
Tenderize abalone slices, dip in beaten eggs, then into bread crumbs. Fry  abalone as usual. After frying place layer of abalone in a buttered  casserole dish. Then layer of chopped green onion, a layer of chili pepper  and a layer of cheese. Repeat until dish is full. Top with bread crumbs and  dot with butter. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes. I use leftover  abalone it saves alot of steps and a good use for the leftovers. Just layer  as above.  Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by ehgf@primenet.com (Ellen) on Jan 4, 1998
