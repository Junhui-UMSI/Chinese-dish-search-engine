I cant say that I have actually made this recipe, but the ones I have made  from the same book are quite reliable. This is minimally adapted from  "Madeleine Kammans Savoie" by Madeleine Kamman (Atheneum: NY, 1989).    Heat the butter in a large saute pan, add the garlic and leek, and toss in  the hot butter 3 to 4 minutes. Add all the greens, salt and pepper. Cover  the pot to draw the water out of the vegetables. Remove the pot lid and  cook, stirring occasionally until all the water has evaporated. Cool  completely. Beat the eggs, egg yolks, and cooked greens together. Make a  well in the flour. Put the egg/greens mixture in the well. Add the salt.  Draw the flour into the egg mixture. Knead into a smooth dough  approximately 10 minutes; flour your hands lightly if the flour is too wet  or moisten them with a little extra egg if the flour is too dry. Either cut  the dough into about six pieces and run through a pasta rolling machine  until smooth and dry, or continue to knead for a few more minutes by hand  to get the same effect. From here on in, you can follow your favorite  method for turning the dough into noodles, either stretching it by hand or  using a machine.
