Tomato Concasse
Ripe red tomatoes, Kosher salt to taste, 
Peel a tomato by placing it on the tines of a long fork and holding it over  a gas flame. Rotating the fork constantly so that the flesh doesnt cook,  sear the skin. You will need about 5 to 15 seconds, depending on the  tomatos size. Repeat until all of the tomatoes have been seared. Set the  tomatoes aside to cool. When they are cool enough to handle, remove their  skins. Cut them in half horizontally (through the equator), cut out the  gore, and gently squeeze out the seeds and gel. Chop them fine, and put  them in a strainer lined with cheesecloth. Let them drain for at least 20  minutes; reserve the liquid for another use. Transfer the tomatoes to a  nonreactive bowl, and season with salt. Use immediately, or store, covered,  in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
