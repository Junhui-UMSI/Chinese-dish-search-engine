I took a recipe from a great southern cook named Jimmie Blue Graeber  (anyone woman named Jimmie Blue has to be southern...) and modified it to  be ff vegetarian, with great results, I think. Here it is:    Mix everything together except 1/2 cup rice. Bring to boil, then reduce  heat to lowest setting and simmer uncovered for 2-3 hours. Stir often  because this stuff tends to stick. Add rest of rice, bring to boil again,  reduce heat again and simmer until rice is cooked. Add water as necessary  throughout this process to maintain the right consistancy. It should be a  very thick stew.    You could add all the rice in the beginning, but I like some of the rice to  disolve and some of it to be less cooked-to-death.    I was very pleased with the results of this effort, I had gone into it  without very high hopes, since traditional Brunswich stew is such a  meat-intensive recipe (the orginal recipe called for 2 lb of chicken and 1  lb of pork).
