Roll in salt and pack in  quart jar.  Cover and let stand at room temperature for 4 days.  Then add  remain- ing ingredients and let stand for 4 or 5 more days.  Store in  refrigerator.  Makes 1 quart.    It is the "1/4 cup crushed dried hot red pepper" that I wonder about.  I  like and appreciate hot food, and am not known to complain.  To me, these  were not too hot, they were just not good. But, maybe I just have to  acquire a taste for them!    The only changes I made to the recipe:  I was able to add only about a half  cup of the heated salad oil.  Perhaps the lemons I used were too large. And  I snipped the ends off the lemons. The recipe says nothing about that, but  I thought it seemed the practical thing to do.    Anyway, that is my experience with the pickled lemon wedges.  If anyone  else has an opinion or recipe recommendation I would appreciate it. And if  anyone wants to try the recipe as posted, I would value their comments.    Thanks again for your concern, Kathy.  I would like to try the recipe again  if I did something wrong.
