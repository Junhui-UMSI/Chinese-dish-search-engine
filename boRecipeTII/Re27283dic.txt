MAIN RECIPE: Tiropetes - Cheese triangles    Prepare bechamel sauce and allow it to cool; add feta cheese, eggs, grated  cheese, parsley and 3 tbsp melted butter to sauce and mix well. Cut filo  sheets into long strips 3 inches wide and brush with melted butter. Place  one tsp of the cheese mixture at the bottom of each strip and fold the  corner up to form a triangle; continue folding in a triangular shape until  the entire strip is folded. Continue this method until all the ingredients  are used.  Place triangles on cookie sheets; brush each with butter and  bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Serve at  once. These triangles may be prepared ahead of time, frozen and baked when  ready to serve.    VARIATION: Meat - Kreatopetes    Either use cooked leftover meats, chopped; or saute fresh ground beef,  breaking it up with a fork into small pieces. Combine meat with cheese and  egg in a bowl. Place a teaspoonful on filo strips, fold, brush with butter  and bake in the same manner as cheese triangles.    VARIATION: Fish - Psaropetes    Mix together seafood, bechamel sauce, parsley and lemon juice. Place a  teaspoonful on filo strips, fold, brush with butter, and bake in the same  manner as cheese triangles.    VARIATION: Spinach - Spanakopetas    Wash the spinach, cut off the stems, dry completely with towels, and chop.  Brown the scallions in 1/2 cup olive oil until tender. Combine spinach,  parsley, dill, beaten eggs and cheese; add cooked scallions; season with  salt lightly and mix well.  Place a teaspoonful of the filling on the filo  leaves and proceed to fold, brush with butter and bake in the same manner  as cheese triangles.    Bechamel:  Melt butter in a pan, add flour, and stir until smooth. Lower  heat, and gradually add the hot milk, stirring constantly until it  thickens. Season with salt and pepper.                            Source: Greek Cooking for the Gods by Eva Zane  Submitted By SAM WARING <WARING@IMA.INFOMAIL.COM> On 12 JUN 1995 095335  +0100
