Pork tenderloin, Regular or coarse-grain, Fresh bread crumbs, 3, olive oil, Chopped fresh parsley, Salt, Black Pepper, Garlic, 
1. Preheat oven to 400*. Lightly oil a rack or coat with nonstick cooking  spray and set it on a baking sheet. Set aside. 2. Pat pork tenderloin dry  with a paper towel. Tuck the narrow end under and secure it with a  toothpick/ 3. On a work surface, coarsely chop garlic cloves. Sprinkle them  with salt and mash them to a puree with the blade of the knife held  sideways. Transfer the puree to a bowl and add breadcrumbs, parsley, oil,  and pepper. Mix thoroughly to be sure the oil and garlic are evenly  distributed. 4. On a piece of plastic wrap, spread out half of the  breadcrumb mixture in a strip as long as the tenderloin. Coat one side of  the tenderloin generously with the mustard. Turn the tenderloin over and  set it down on the crumbs so they adhere to the mustard. Coat the remaining  surfaces of the meat with mustard,. Press on remaining crumb mixture. 5.  Transfer the tenderloin to the prepared rack. Roast for 30-35 minutes, or  until barely pink inside and the internal temperature is 160*. Let stand  for 5 minutes before slicing, being careful to remove the toothpick when  you reach it.    NOTES : Cooking Tip: Fresh breadcrumbs are most easily made in the food  processor, but you can also chop them by hand with a knife. Dressed Up, but  simple enough for a weeknight. The golden crust of mustard and breadcrumbs  seals in the tenderloins natural juices.  Recipe by: Safeway Fresh Ideas magazine Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #517  by louiseh@juno.com on Mar 14, 1997
