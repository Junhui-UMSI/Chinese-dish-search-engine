Almost Stuffed Cabbage Variations
Recipe, See Almost Stuffed Cabbage, 
Ive made something similar quite often.  The only difference is I mix the  ground meat with the rice and 1 Tbs. of Worschestershire to form meatballs.  Once the rest of the mixture starts to boil, I add the meatballs and let  cook for at least an hour.  The longer it cooks, the thicker it is. And  yes, I do add golden raisins. Even thought Im not a raisin fan, they do  add a sweetness to the dish.  I love this over mashed potatoes!
