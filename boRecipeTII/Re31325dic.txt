From: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU>    Date: Thu, 4 Jul 1996 00:49:04 EDT  Preheat griddle over moderately high heat while you mix bannocks, or, if  using an electric griddle, preheat to 400 F. Place 4 cups oatmeal in a  mixing bowl; buzz the rest in an electric blender at high speed until  moderately fine, then reserve to use in rolling out dough. Add remaining  ingredients to bowl and mix well. Knead on a board lightly dusted with the  fine oatmeal 1 minute, roll 1/4" thick, and cut into rounds with a 3"  cutter. Cook on an ungreased griddle 5 - 6 minutes per side until lightly  browned and cooked through. Serve hot with plenty of butter.    EAT-L Digest  3 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
