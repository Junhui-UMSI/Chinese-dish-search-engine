Prawns with Cilantro-Ginger-Lime Butter
Butter, fresh cilantro, fresh ginger, Garlic, Limes, Red bell peppers, Black tiger prawns, Dry white wine, Salt and pepper, Fresh spinach, 
In the bowl of a food processor, combine butter, cilantro, ginger and  garlic. Process until smooth. Add the juice of 3 limes and mix well.      Saute bell peppers and prawns in the cilantro-butter mixture over medium heat.   The wine may be added at this point. (It helps keep the butter from  scorching and makes a smoother sauce.)   Cook until prawns are pink and just  barely done. Season with salt and pepper.      Serve on 1/2 cup of julienned spinach for each serving, drizzling the  butter over the top to wilt the spinach. Garnish with lime wedges.      From Silverwater Cafe, Port Townsend Wash.    From the Oregonian FOODday, 1/5/93.    Posted by Stephen Ceideburg
