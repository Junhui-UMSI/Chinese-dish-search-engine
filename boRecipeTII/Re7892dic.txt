Posole is a feasts day favorite among the Pueblo Indians who live in the  Rio Grande Vaslley. Its special flavor and character, however, have made it  a year-around favorite of all New Mexicans.    Place the posole and water in a large, heavy pot; bring to a simmer, cover  and cook slowly until the kernels burst and are almost tender (about 3 1/2  hours).    When the posole is almost done, lightly brown onions and garlic in in a  skillet in 2 Tablespoons of cooking oil; drain on paper towels. Add another  2 Tablespoons of cooking oil to the skillet and brown the pork cubes, a few  at a time. Drain on paper towels.    Add onion, garlic, pork and all remaining ingredients to the posole. Mix  well and simmer covered for 3 more hours. Taste for salt and adjust as  needed.    Serve in large soup plates and pass a rich red chile sauce for topping, if  desired. Serve with warm tortillas.    Yield: 8-10 servings    Source: Simply Simpatico, A Taste of New Mexico , from the Junior League of  Albuquerque (1981).  There are a lot of variations on this theme. One which we like a lot  involves adding red chile sauce (the kind you make with just pureed red  chiles and NO tomatos) to the mixture during the last couple of hours of  cooking and adjusting the amount of jalape?os accordingly. This, of course,  makes a red posole rather than the posole verde of the recipe above.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V4 #169 by The Old Bear <oldbear@arctos.com>  on Oct 23, 1997
