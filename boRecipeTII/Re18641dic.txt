Roll out pastry and cut into squares enough  to cover apples completely.  Peel and core apples.  Roll in lemon juice. Then roll in white sugar and  cinnamon combined. Place on pastry square. Stuff core cavity with brown  sugar, butter, brown sugar in equal parts. (The amount depends on size of  core cavity, just stuff full.) Fold pastry up around apple to completely  enclose it.  Place in pan. Prepare sugar sauce by mixing water, sugar,  vanilla, butter, nutmeg, and mace and boiling for 1 minute. Let cool  slightly.  Pour over Apples. Bake in 375 F oven for 1 hour. Serve warm.  Note:  Apples may be frozen in pastry (before sugar sauce is added) if  desired.  Good dessert to make ahead if you have lots of apples around.  Just let thaw when ready to use, and cover with sugar sauce and bake as  usual.    Source:  Amish Cooking in Quilt Country show Typed by: Melissa Mierau,  Martensville, SK
