Bacon and Double Cheeseburger Loaf
Sweet onion; such as, Black Pepper, Coarsely shredded sharp, Salt, India or other sweet pickle, Ketchup, Firm fresh white bread, Regular or low fat, Bacon, Lean ground chuck or ground, Dry mustard, Egg, 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over  medium heat until it is limp and some of the fat is rendered, 3 to 4  minutes. Remove the bacon from the skillet and reserve.    In a large mixing bowl, use your hands to gently but thoroughly mix  together the meat, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of the cheese, onion, mayonnaise,  relish, mustard, salt, pepper, and egg. Pat the mixture into a shallow 2  quart baking pan. Spread the top of the loaf with ketchup, then lay the  bacon strips over the ketchup. Bake until the loaf is firm and the bacon is  crisp, 45 to 50 minutes, sprinkling the top of the loaf with the remaining  1/2 cup cheese to melt during the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Internal  temperature should be 155 degrees. Let the meatloaf stand in the baking  dish for 10 minutes, then cut into squares to serve. For leftovers, reheat  slices in a microwave and serve on sesame buns with lettuce, tomato and  ketchup.    Yield: 6 servings    NOTES : Recipe courtesy of Melanie Barnard, "Everybody Loves Meatloaf"    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL9052    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Feb 7, 1998
