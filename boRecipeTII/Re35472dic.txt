Combine the spices in a dish.  Cut the meat into strips less than 1/4 of an  inch thick.  Remove ALL fat. Sprinkle one side with the combined seasonings  and beat with a meat hammer.  Turn and repeat the seasoning and beating.  Place the strips on a cookie sheet or other flat pan. Place in a 120 degree  F. oven for 4 hours. Turn and put back for another 4 hours. Keep the oven  door propped open for the entire time to allow the moisture to escape. With  a gas oven, the pilot light may be enough to provide the heat. Store in a  plastic bag.
