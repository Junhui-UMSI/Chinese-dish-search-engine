White Sauce/bechamel (#10)
Salt, Butter, Black Pepper, milk, Flour, 
1.  In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter* over low heat, until foamy. With  a wooden spoon, stir in the flour until a thick paste forms. This is called  a "roux."    2.  Whisk in the milk until smooth.  Stirring occasionally, cook 10 to 12  minutes, until simmering, thick, and smooth.  Simmer 2 minutes to "cook  out" the flour taste.    3.  Season with the salt and freshly ground black pepper.    TIP:  * If you brown the butter slightly after it has melted (dont burn  it!), it will add a nutty flavor to the sauce.
