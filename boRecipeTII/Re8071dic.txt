From: Bulldogfla <Bulldogfla@aol.com>    by Mimi Rippee    Peel, slice, and wash potatoes. Place them in a pot and cover them with  cold milk. Bring them to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.    Meanwhile, peel the garlic clove and rub it well all over the bottom and  sides of a 1 quart baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.    Gently transfer the potato slices to the baking dish, layering as you go.  Season each layer with salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. Do not discard  the milk.    Beat the eggs with the cooled milk and half of the grated cheese and pour  over the potatoes. Cover with the remaining cheese. Bake for 45 minutes, or  until the top is golden.
