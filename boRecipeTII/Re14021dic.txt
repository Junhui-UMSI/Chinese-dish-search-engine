Walnuts, Sour cream, Sugar, marshmallow, Margarine, White chocolate, 
I found those recipies in th Key Gourmet CD-ROM. I havent tried them but I  hope they help.    Mix together sour cream and margarine, bring to full rolling boil, boil to  soft ball stage. Remove from heat, add chocolate until melted, add  marshmallow creme and nuts, put in greased 8 or 9 inch pan, cool at room  temperature, cut in squares. Makes 2 1/2 pounds.
