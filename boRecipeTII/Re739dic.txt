Grilled Salmon Fillets With granny Smith Vinaigrette
Salmon fillet, salt and pepper, Instant flour, Granny Smith apple, Bacon, white wine, hazelnut oil, fresh tarragon, 
From the Dean & DeLuca Cookbook by David Rosengarten    Place a cast iron skillet over high heat til very hot, about 5 mins. Cook  bacon and reserve. Cut the fillets into portions. Season with salt and  pepper; then flour lightly with instant flour. Add all the salmon to the  pan in which bacon was cooked, and cook til browned outside and just done  in the center. Make the vinaigrette at the last minute. Beat together the  apple, the vinegar, the hazelnut oil and the 2 tsps of chopped tarragon. To  serve, divide the fillets among 4 plates. Top with the diced apples removed  from the vinaigrette with a slotted spoon. Mince the bacon finely, and top  the apples with that. Put the remainder of the vinaigrette over and around  the fish. Garnish with fresh tarragon leaves. (Serves 4).    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by Cairn Rodrigues <cairnann@yahoo.com> on Aug  15, 1998,
