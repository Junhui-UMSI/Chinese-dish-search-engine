Start sauteing the pepper, onion and garlic in broth, wine, or water. As  this is cooking, put all the rest of the ingredients in a big pot. Add 1  cup water if it is not "soupy" enough. Stir well and heat slowly over med.  high heat. It can boil, but its messy. Add the veggies when they are to  your liking. Stir everything, and as soon as it is warm enough, serve in  big bowls over fatfree tortilla chips, and top with a little fatfree  cheese, if you wish. We ate ours with a little fatfree sour cream. YUM!    *** Since Im not into Tex-Mex or spicy stuff, I cut the seasoning the  party dip mix in half and it was still spicy enough for us!
