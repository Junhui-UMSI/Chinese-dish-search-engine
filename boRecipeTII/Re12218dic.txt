Zucchini Cheddar Bread
Grated sharp Cheddar cheese, Grated zucchini; well, Onion, Dried basil, All-purpose flour, Butter, milk, Baking Powder, Eggs, Dried thyme, Blanched almonds, Salt, Vegetable oil, 
Preheat the oven to 300 F. Butter and flour a 9" round pan. Chop the  almonds and spread on a cookie sheet to toast in the oven. Turn and stir  them occasionally, watching like a hawk until they are golden brown. Set  aside and raise the oven heat to 400 F.    Combine the dry ingredients and toss gently with the cheese. Saute the  onion in the butter until soft, then drop it into a blender or food  processor along with the milk, oil, eggs and seasonings and blend well. Add  the zucchini and make sure everything is well integrated before you stir in  the toasted almonds, by hand. Pour the whole mixture into the dry  ingredients. Stir lightly, then spread the batter into the pan and bake for  40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before removing from the pan. Cut in wedges  to serve.
