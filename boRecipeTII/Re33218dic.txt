Basic Pesto
Garlic, Olive oil (or as needed), Fresh basil, Heavy cream, Pine nuts, 
In a blender place the basil, pine nuts, and garlic. Pur?e them so that  they are smooth.  With the blender running on low, slowly dribble in enough  of the olive oil until a pur?ed consistency is achieved (do not add too  much oil).  Add the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, and stir them in.
