Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. In a saut_  pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot, caramelize the onions for  about 10 minutes. In an electric mixer with a whip attachment, whip the egg  whites until stiff. Switch the whip attachment to a paddle attachment and  cream the butter and sugar together. Add the egg yolks, one at a time,  beating well after each yolk. With the machine running add the apple juice  and ginger. In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and  pepper, together. With the machine on low speed, alternate adding the flour  1/3 at a time with the milk. Do not over mix the batter. Fold in the stiff  egg whites. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50-60 minutes  or until the center of the bread comes out clean. Remove the pan from the  oven and invert onto a wire rack. Allow the bread to cool for 5 minutes  before slicing. Slice a couple of slices from the loaf and place the loaf  and the slices on a plate.
