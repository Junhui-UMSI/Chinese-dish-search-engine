Zucchini Slaw
Cider vinegar, Salt, Medium-sized zucchini; (, -sized yellow straight-neck, Cayenne pepper, Mayonnaise, Sugar, Pepper, Vegetable oil, 
1. Cut zucchini, yellow squash and red pepper into matchstick thin strips  or shred in food processor; set aside. I do not peel the squash, but wash  them very well. However if you like to have them peeled, that is fine.    2. In large bowl, with wire whisk or fork, beat salad oil, vinegar,  mayonnaise, sugar, salt and pepper until mixed. Add vegetables; gently toss  to mix well. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours to blend flavors,  stirring occasionally.
