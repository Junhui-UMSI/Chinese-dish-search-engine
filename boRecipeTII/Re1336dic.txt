Duxelles (Mushroom Seasoning)
Mushrooms; Chopped, Shallots; Chopped, Butter, olive oil, Nutmeg; Grated, 
Chop the mushrooms very, very fine and squeeze in a cloth to remove as much  liquid as possible, capturing the liquid. Set aside. Cook the shallots in a  mixture of butter and olive oil until golden. Add the mushrooms and their  juice plus the nutmeg. Season to taste. Saute on high heat until all the  mushroom liquid has been absorbed. Refrigerate until ready to use. Will  keep up to five days.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Aug 28, 98,
