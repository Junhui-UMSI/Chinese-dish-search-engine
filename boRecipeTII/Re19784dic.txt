It should be as thick as possible (drain off water as it  cooks). Use a heavy pan so the applesauce will cook without sticking.    Soak the gelatin in  1/2 cup of the applesauce. Bring the rest of the  applesauce and the sugar to a boil. After it is boiling, add the  applesauce-gelatin mixture and bring back to a slow boil for 15 minutes,  stirring almost constantly. Add the walnuts, lemon extract and vanilla.  Pour into a buttered pan. Let stand at least 24 hours, then cut into  squares and roll in confectioners sugar. Store in refrigerator.    A 8-inch square pan, might make the candy too thick. A 9 by 13-inch pan  would probably make it too thin. The mixture should be about  3/4-inch  deep, so adjust the pan size.    Cotlets: Use 1 cup  apricot  jam and 1 cup applesauce, cutting sugar to 3  cups. Or use canned unsweetened  apricots,  drained. Mash well with a  potato masher. Use 2 cups mashed apricots and and follow recipe as written.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
