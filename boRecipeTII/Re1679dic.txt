Margarine, Chocolate chips, Walnuts, Colored mini marshmallows, coconut, 
Heat margarine and chocolate chips in the top pan of a double boiler over  low heat, stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. Cool slightly.  Put marshmallows and nuts in a large bowl; stir in chocolate. Tear five  9-inch sheets of waxed paper and sprinkle each generously with coconut.  Divide dough into fifths and place each fifth on a sheet of waxed paper.  Roll tightly into 2-inch diameter logs and refrigerate overnight. Before  serving, unwrap from waxed paper and cut into 1/2" slices.
