In large pot, brown onions in 3 Tbsp. of oil or butter. Add meat and brown.  Add salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Add water, cover and simmer over low heat  for 1 hr, stirring occasionally.    Wash, but dont peel quinces.  Use apple corer to remove seeds. Slice as  for apple pie.  In skillet, saute in 2 Tbsp. oil or butter and set aside.    To the meat, add sugar, vinegar or lemon juice, saffron, split peas, and  quince.  Cover and simmer 35 minutes. Check to see that meat and fruit are  cooked. Taste and correct seasoning. Transfer to deep casserole dish and  keep in warm oven until ready to serve. Serve hot with chelo (recipe  below.)    (Note: I am giving the detailed instructions for chelo. I dont use the  yogurt and I drizzle the remaining saffron over *all* the rice. I also  serve the tah dig(crust) with the rest of the rice.)    Chelo:  Wash rice 5 times in cold water.  Bring water and salt to boil in a  large non-stick pan.  Add washed and drained rice. Boil 6 minutes, stirring  gently twice to loosen grains that may have stuck to bottom. Drain rice in  colander and rinse in lukewarm water.    In same pot, heat half the butter, 2 Tbsp. hot water, a drop of dissolved  saffron, and yogurt.  Taking one spatula at a time, place rice gently in  pot mounding in the shape of a pyramid.    Dissolve remaining butter in 2 Tbsp. hot water and pour over rice. Place  clean dishtowel over pot and cover firmly with lid to prevent steam from  escaping. Cook 10 minutes over medium heat and 50 minutes over low heat.  Remove from heat.    Allow to cool 5 minutes on a damp surface without removing lid. Put 2 Tbsp.  of the rice in with remaining saffron and set aside for garnish. Gently  remove rice from pot without disturbing crust. Sprinkle saffron flavored  rice over top and serve. Detach crust and serve separately.                                        >From _Food of Life_.        posted by: Sarah Henderson <sehender@reed.edu>        from the rec.food.recipes archives        Stephanie da Silva (arielle@taronga.com), archivist Submitted By SAM  WARING <SAM.WARING@382-91-12.IMA.INFOMAIL.COM> On WED, 01 NOV 1995 134731  GMT
