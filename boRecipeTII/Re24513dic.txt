In a large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Saute onion, leek and  garlic for 3 minutes. Add rice and pepper and saute for 5 minutes more.    In a separate pot, heat vegetable broth to nearly boiling, then remove from  heat. Add 7 cups broth and sundried tomatoes to rice mixture. Reserve  remaining 1 cup broth. Bring rice mixture to a boil and reduce heat to a  lively simmer for 12 minutes, stirring often.    Meanwhile, after 10 minutes, combine reserved cup of broth, asparagus,  mushrooms and basil in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover loosely with plastic  and heat in microwave on high for 1 1/2 minutes, until hot but not  completely cooked. Add mixture to simmering rice, mix well and simmer about  5 minutes more, until mixture is creamy and rice is just done.    Helpful hint: If you dont have a microwave, steam asparagus, mushrooms and  basil for 5 minutes, until asparagus is tender-crisp. Add to the mixture  along with remaining 1 cup vegetable broth. Continue cooking and stirring  until mixture is creamy and rice is done.    This was the second place winner in Vegetarian Times recipe contest.
