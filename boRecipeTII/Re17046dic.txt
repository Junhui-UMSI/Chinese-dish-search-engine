Mix pork, onion, eggs, crab, sprouts, bean threads, parsley, salt and  pepper as you would to make meatballs. Fill a large flat bowl with warm  water. Using 2 triangular papers for each spring roll, dip into warm water  and overlap points (tip to tip). Place one large spoonful of pork mixture  onto one paper and roll across to end of facing paper, tucking in the ends.  Deep fry in hot oil about 10-15 minutes until dark golden brown. To eat,  place a spring roll in a lettuce-leaf lined with a couple of mint leaves,  roll up and dip in fish sauce, below.    FISH SAUCE    1 pint lemonade (or 1 lemon cut & squeezed thoroughly, 1 pint water and  sugar to taste) 2 cloves crushed garlic 1 Tbsp or more (to taste) of  bottled fish sauce (available in Oriental                stores) 1/2 tsp crushed Italian red pepper    Add garlic and crushed red pepper to lemonade.

Thaw  and fry an additional 5-10 minutes when ready to serve. Fish sauce will  keep in fridge a couple weeks.    Enjoy--Rona Watts
