Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring  constantly until mixture comes to hard boil.  At once, stir in sugar. Bring  to full rolling boil; boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove  from heat; skim off foam with metal spoon.  Stir and skim for 5 minutes to  prevent floating fruit.  Pour into hot sterilized jars leaving 1/4 inch  headspace.  Cover while hot with sterilized two piece meal lids with new  centres.  Cool completely and then check to make sure lids have sealed.  Label and store. Makes about 8 cups.
