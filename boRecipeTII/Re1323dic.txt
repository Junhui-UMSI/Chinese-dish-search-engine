Dougs Sweet and Sour Sauce
Brown sugar, Rice vinegar, Water, Light soy sauce, Dark soy sauce, Catsup, 
* bring measuring cup with brown sugar in it to half with rice vinegar,  then fill cup to 3/4 mark with water.    Place all of above in a saucepan and heat to simmer, ensuring that the  sugar disolves...chop 1 medium to small carrot into chinese roll cut and  place in simmering mixture...cut half a green pepper into chunks and also  place in saucepan...prepare 2 tbls cornstarch with 2 tbls water and have  ready...when carrots are tender firm, add cornstarch mix, slowly, using  only as much as required to thicken. Taste, and add salt, if required, then  add a good shot of red food coloring, and one tsp of sesame oil, and stir  it in. This makes a superb sweet and sour sauce with a little bite, ideal  for any Chinese dish calling for sweet and sour, and the rice wine vinegar  is a lot less vinegary than others    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Nov  06, 1998,
