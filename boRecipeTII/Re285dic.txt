Combine the 1/2 cup cheese with bacos. Mix well. In a 2+1/2 quart bowl,  layer spinach, cheese mixture, mushrooms, onions, and peas. Combine  mayonnaise or yogurt, sour cream and sugar; mix well. With a rubber  spatula, spread the mixture like icing over the top of the salad to seal.  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese. Cover. Refrigerate overnight. Serve  with or without tossing the salad. Serves 6 as a main course luncheon with  crusty bread or 8 as a side salad; more on a buffet.    [PER SERVING: 123 cals, 1g fat, or 7% cff]    This was a family favorite main dish lunch during Roswell, NM summers.  Thick salad with heady flavor. Make it the night before. Serve in the heat  of the day. Back then we used regular or low fat products. The new fatfree  cheese are just as good. The cheesy dressing permeates the vegetables; not  sure if we eat the salad or inhale it. Always a winner at parties, people  wanted to know how much blue cheese we used. -- Pat Hanneman    Recipe by: Dorothy Hanneman / Modified    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by Pat Hanneman <kitpath@earthlink.net> on Sep  13, 1998,
