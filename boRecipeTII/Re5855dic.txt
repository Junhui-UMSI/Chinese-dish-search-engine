Piquant Lemon Rice
Raw cashew pieces, Basmati white rice, Salt, Black mustard seeds, Ghee, Coarsely chopped coriander, Water, Lemon juice, Turmeric, Yellow split peas, Shredded coconut, 
Wash rice.  Bring water to a boil.  Stir in rice, salt & 1/2 tb ghee. Cover  with a tight-fitting lid.  Reduce heat to very low & gently simmer, no  peeking, for 20 to 25 minutes. The rice should be light & fluffy & the  water should be absorbed.    Set side, leaving covered.    Heat the remaining ghee in a small pot over a moderate heat till hot. Drop  in the cashews & stir fry till golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon &  pour over rice. Cover the rice again.    Raise the heat slightly & toss in the split peas & mustard seeds (you can  omit the peas) & fry till the seeds turn grey & sputter.    Pour the fried seeds into the rice & sprinkle with turmeric, lemon &  coriander.  Gently fold till well mixed.    Garnish each serving with coconut.    For a variation, substitute lime juice for lemon juice.    Yamuna Devi, The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking.
