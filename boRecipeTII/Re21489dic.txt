Apple Pie
Text Only, 
You can make a 2-crust pie by doubling the crust recipe I put up there, or  you can make a crumb topping by mixing 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar,  and 1 cup flour with a pastry cutter until its crumbly. For that pie, bake  it at 400 degrees for 40-50 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned but  the topping isnt burned. (Check frequently after 35 minutes)    Fillings easy.  Peel, core and slice about 7 apples, enough to make 6-7  cups. Mix with 1 Tbsp of lemon juice.  In another bowl, mix together 1/4  cup flour, 3/4 cups granulated sugar, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Pour  it over the apples and mix well.  I like to do this before preparing the  crust so that it gets a bit liquid and better distributed over the apples.  Anyway, you fill the pie, top with either pastry or streusel, and bake -  45-55 minutes at 425 degrees for a pastry-topped pie, and dont forget to  pierce the top crust in several places. If you want something different,  you can also add 3/4 to 1 cup of either cranberries or raisins to the  apples, too.    Another thing - dont forget to lay out foil either on the bottom of the  oven or on the rack below the pie to save cleanup.    * From the Polka Dot Cottage, 1-201-822-3627, NJs BBS for Homemakers!
