ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW#EE2304    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the  water. Add the butter, sugar, and molasses and mix well. Stir in the  caraway seeds, potatoes, chocolate, rye and wheat flours, and the cornmeal.  Using your hands, mix the ingredients together, do not over handle. Form  into a smooth ball. Grease a bowl, turn the dough into the bowl and cover  with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for 1 1/4 hours or until double  in size. Flour the work surface and turn the dough out onto the floured  surface and punch down. This will allow any gases to escape. Using your  hands flatten the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough  into pieces and form each into a roll about 3 inches in diameter. Place the  rolls on a parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the rolls with the egg wash  and sprinkle with the poppy seeds. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden  brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.    Yield: 18 rolls    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 21, 1998
