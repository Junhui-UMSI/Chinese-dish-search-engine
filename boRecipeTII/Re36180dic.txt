A VERY QUICK AND EASY STEW RECIPE    Heat the cooker.  Add shortening. Brown the meat.  Add the vegetables,  stewed tomatoes, and water, and place over the meat.    Close the cover securely.  Place pressure regulator on vent pipe and cook  10-12 minutes with pressure regulator rocking slowly. Cool cooker at once.  If desired, make a paste of 1 tablespoon flour and 1/4 cup of water and  stir into stew to thicken.    Another method of preparing stew is to cook the meat separately 8-10  minutes, then add the vegetables and cook 5 more minutes with the presure  regulator rocking slowly.    My Seasoning: 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part black  pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.       Deidre Anne Penrod, Prodigy Food & Wine Board
