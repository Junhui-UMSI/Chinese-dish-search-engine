Lemon Poppyseed Bread

Throw everything in and press play.  I use the white bread setting.    As far as I know, this is an original.  Its sized for a 1.5 pound  (R2D2-style) Welbilt.    * I know that 7 oz is a weird measurement, but it seems to be what works.  If I use a full cup, then it comes out very gooey, and 3/4 cup is a little  too dry.  Also, I make this with refrigerated lemonade and the hottest tap  water I can get, but I always use the timer.  The proper way to do it would  be to heat the lemonade and water to 130oF or so.    >From: Patti Beadles <patti@hosehead.intel.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
