* firmly packed ** (2 1/2 - 3 cups)     These cookies go well with after dinner coffee or tea.     In a bowl, sift together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, salt and baking soda  and set aside.     In a large bowl, cream the butter. Add the coffee, almond extract,  granulated and brown sugars and beat well. Add the eggs one at a time until  smooth after each addition. On low speed gradually add the sifted dry  ingredients, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until  the mixture is smooth. Gently mix in the almonds.     Spread out two pieces of wax paper. place large spoonfuls of the dough  lengthwise on each piece of paper to form heavy strips about 10-11 inches  long. Fold the long sides of the paper p against the dough and, pressing  against the paper with your hands, shape each strip of dough into a smooth  oblong 12 inches long, 3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. Wrap the  dough in the wax paper.     Slide a cookie sheet under both packages of dough and transfer them to the  freezer or refrigerator for several hours or overnight. This slices best  when dough is frozen solid.     Preheat oven to 375?. Unwrap one roll of dough at a time. Place dough on a  cutting board. With a very sharp knife cut the dough into 1/4-inch slices  and place them 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.     Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes at 375?. The cookies are done  when they are slightly colored and spring back when lightly pressed with a  fingertip.    Yield: 4 dozen.
