Baileys Irish Cream Whiskey
Whipping cream, Sweetened chocolate syrup, Coconut extract, Egg yolks; room temp., 14 ounce can sweetened, Irish whiskey, 
In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks until thick. Stir in the condensed  milk, cream, whiskey, chocolate syrup and coconut extract. Beat for one  minute. Taste and add more coconut extract if desired.    In a large decanter, pour Irish Cream whiskey. Seal. Sore in the  refrigerator and allow to mellow 7 days before using. Will keep for 2  weeks.    Makes about 5 cups.    NOTES : Everything emulsifies better if all of the ingredients are a room  temp.. If the egg yolks are cold when mixed they tend to stay together more  and are visible in the drink ( not very pretty).  Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by GAdams1350@aol.com on Sep 20, 1997
