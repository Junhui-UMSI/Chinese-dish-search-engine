Green corn steamed & dried on the cob then shelled is called chicos. They  do not burst when cooked, they merely swell. Cover chicos with water & boil  for 3-4 hours with the garlic, salt & ground chiles. Boil ham hocks & pigs  feet together for 30 minutes. Combine with chicos, using a reasonable  amount of the liquid. Serve with sopapillas or Indian bread.    From the <The Bliss of Cooking Returns>, Fort Bliss Officers Wives Club,  Ft. Bliss, TX.
