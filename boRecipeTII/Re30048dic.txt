Balsamic Chard
Chopped tomatoes), To taste, (~1-1.5 lb?) of swiss chard, 2 T balsamic vinegar, Freshly cracked black pepper, 2 tomatoes, chopped (or one, (or greens of choice), 
Wash the chard and chop or tear into peices, discarding tough stems. Saute  tomatoes over medium heat in large skillet until cooked to desired  consistancy, 5-15 min. (I like mine on the soft side). Add vinegar, chard  and water if needed.  Cover and steam vegetables until cooked to desired  doneness, 5-15 min. Check occasionally to be sure there is enough water in  the pan.    Cooking time for tomatoes and greens depends on how tough the greens are,  smaller, younger leaves will be more tender; and how well cooked you like  the vegetables.
