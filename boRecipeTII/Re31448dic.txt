Barbecue Sauce
Fresh serranos minced, Prepared yellow mustard, Ketchup, Onions, Strong black coffee, Dark brown sugar, Vegetable oil, Garlic, Chili powder, Cider vinegar, Fresh jalapenos minced, Worcestershire Sauce, Lemon juice, Salt, 
In a saucepan, heat the oil. Add the onions, jalapenos, serranos, and  garlic, and cook them over low heat until soft. Add everything else, cover  the pan, and simmer 40 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool to room  temperature.    Strain out the remaining solids, liquify them in a food processor, and add  them back to the strained liquid, stirring thoroughly. Set the sauce aside  for several hours before serving to permit flavors to blend.    Refrigerate the sauce, covered, and use it as needed. It will keep for  weeks.
