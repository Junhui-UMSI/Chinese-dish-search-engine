Baked Fish with Tahina
Lemon, Tahina paste (not hummous), Water, Garlic, Garlic, Fish fillets or whole fish(, Parsley, SAUCE, Bit of oil, Salt, black pepper,  touch, Salt/pepper, OR, Water -and-, Lemon or white wine vinegar, 
cut 2-3 incisions in the skin of the fish on both sides and rub inside and  out with mixture of pepper/salt and a bit of oil. Put the garlic inside the  fish.    Sprinkle with parsley , set aside, leave one hour. put fish in a  baking dish.    Prepare tahina sauce and (optional) add  1/2-1 tsp hot chili or some type  of harissa ( prepared ok). Pour the sauce over the fish.. bake 350 oven for  30 minutes ( or until the fish is tender). Serve with lemon wedges,  /lightly toasted pine nuts or almonds rice is a great addition...to sop up  the sauce... also pita...    Note:  you can be creative...sometimes I just put lots of parsley and  garlic in the tahina...but you have to know who you are feeding, and if  they like things with a bit more punch. The tahina gets sort of golden..  and there is never any left.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V96 #77    Date: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 10:27:06 +0200    From: shust@inter.net.il
