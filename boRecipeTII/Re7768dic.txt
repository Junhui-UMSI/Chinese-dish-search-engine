Someone mentioned this at the end of the last digest, and I just want to  mention it again. I have been carrying my own dressing around for a while  (I have my ff caesar with me today), since I HATE bottled/processed  dressing, most especially the commercial ff versions. Even the non-fat free  ones add sugar, and to me, dressing should be sour/savory, not sweet. What  I do is carry one of those little rubbermaid containers; it holds about 1/2  c. My homemade dressings are mostly vinegar and spices, except for my  caesar, which is mainly egg-beaters, vinegar, worchesteshire sauce, and  teriaki sauce. In fact, Ill post the recipe here.    Mix all ingredients together, pour over crisp romaine lettuce with ff  croutons.    the measurements are approximate, since I just throw everything in a  plastic container and shake! I also use more citrus juice than vinegar,  although the basalmic really adds a nice flavor. Posted to fatfree digest  V97 #190 by "Jana L.
