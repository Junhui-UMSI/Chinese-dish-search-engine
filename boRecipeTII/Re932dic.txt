Huacatay Chili (Aji De Huacatay)
Mirasol chili, huacatay, saltwort, Salt to taste, Vegetable oil, 
Here are the recipes I have. They are from Comidas criollas peruanas  (Peruvian Creole Food Cookbook). These are the translations in the cookbook  (it is in Spanish and English):    Roast the mirasol chili whole, cut in half and remove the pips and fibers;  wash and grind with the well-washed huacatay leaves and saltwort until a  smooth paste results. Season with salt and a little oil and beat well. The  sauce is then ready to serve-with potatoes, maize ears or boiled meat. It  may also be used with hot fried "cuyes" (a small animal like a guinea-pig).    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by SN Janin <snjanin@anguillanet.com> on Nov  16, 1998,
