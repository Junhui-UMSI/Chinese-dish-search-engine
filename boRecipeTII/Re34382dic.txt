Saute the frozen onions and green peppers in a few tablespoons of water in  a skillet.  Drain and rinse the beans and place in a skillet and mash with  a potato masher. Add the cooked rice, corn, spices and water. Heat 5 to 10  minutes until most of water is absorbed, stirring occasionally.    Heat the tortillas quickly (just to soften) in a preheated skillet, a  toaster oven, or a microwave. Place a line of bean mixture down the middle  of each tortilla, add a teaspoon of salsa and any of the other toppings as  desired.  Fold up 1/2 inch on each side, tuck in the top edge and roll into  a burrito.  Serve immediately, topped with additional salsa if desired.    The leftover bean mixture can be kept in the refrigerator and reheated in  the microwave prior to assembly.    The bean mixture can be adapted by changing the kind of beans (try kidney  beans) or omitting the corn, or adding your favorite ingredient. I got more  servings out of the recipe than the book got out of the original recipe, so  I guess I put less mixture on each tortilla.
