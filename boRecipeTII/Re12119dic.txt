Zucchini Ala Taverna

Eaten at the Taverna restaurant in Herzliyah Pituach    Heat a frying pan on the stove with enough extra virgin olive oil to coat  the pan. Add chopped garlic. Give it a minute to become fragrant. Add the  zucchini, which should be patted dry. Stir until zucchini becomes soft on  high heat (5-8 minutes). Add a good amount of coarsley chopped fresh mint  (handful per panful, but play with the amounts). Sautee until leaves barely  start to wilt. Squeeze lemon over the zucchini and take off the flame.  Bring up to taste with salt and pepper. The mint and zucchini do wonders  for each other. Simple and delicious.
