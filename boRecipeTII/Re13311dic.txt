Source: Vogue May94    What Australians call crayfish (or crawfish, if youre from the South).  They have some unique ones in Oz. The West Australian Marron is probably  the most unique. It is black and very meaty. It is delicious, it has bigger  claws, smaller tail section. Only the shell is black, the meat is pure  white.    To make the dressing: mix the chilli, garlic, tomato, salt, pepper and  sugar and cook in a frying pan with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil for 2 or  3 minutes or until the mixture is soft. Remove from the heat and set aside  to cool. Stir in the lime juice, corian- der, vinegar and the remaining 3  tablespoons of olive oil and set aside for at least 1 hour to allow the  flavours to develop. Taste for salt and pepper and set aside while you cook  the yabbies.    To cook the yabbies: bring the water, beer, brown sugar and salt to the  boil and cook for 5 minutes. Add the yabbies and boil for a further 5 to 6  minutes. Remove the yabbies with a slotted spoon, set aside until cool  enough to handle, then remove the shells.    To serve: place the yabbies in a serving bowl, pour over the dress- ing and  serve at once.
