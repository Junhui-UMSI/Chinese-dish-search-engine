I have started making pita bread, as I stated STARTED I have made some  changes, and what I have now is:    I use my breadmaker to make the dough of normal bread, more whole wheat  than plain flour then I use some extra white flour to make small balls,  which later I flatten out with a rolling pin (?) then comes the trick, for  I have tried various ways, but last night I put them in the oven, a recipe  I had said 3 mins each side, no way the first side was like 10 mins, it is  till they blow up (more or less nicely) and then 3 mins the other side.    What came out was not real flour tortillas, but was very good, first warm  they were good, and now cold they are nice and crispy.  My husband really  enjoyed them.    For the dough I used (more or less the quantities listed); and then watch  it if you need more water or more flour    By the way I use these same things and quantities to make my bread.  In the  bread I add various things, for instance caraway seeds, or garlic, or  raisins, whatever I feel like The bread always comes out good. So this is  my always recipe for bread or dough.
