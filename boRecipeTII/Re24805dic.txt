Aunt Louises Peanut Stuffing
Onion, Fine dry bread crumbs, Cayenne, Butter, Ground peanuts*, Evaporated milk, 
Cook onion slowly in butter 5 minutes.  Add bread crumbs, peanuts, salt,  and a dash of cayenne.  Soften with the evaporated milk.  Yield 1 2/3 cup,  sufficient for 1 medium sized fowl or 6 pork chops.    *My Mama told me that meant  peanuts roasted in the shell,  shelled, put  through a meat grinder.  Ive never made this.  Mama said it was wonderful.    Recipe By     : DDMoms Aunt Louise    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
