Wash the string beans in water.  Snap the stems off.  Break beans  into 2 inch long pieces.    With a vegetable brush, clean the zucchini thoroughly under some  running cold water.  Cut and throw away both ends of each zucchini,  and cut into small rounds.    Peel and cut onion into small pieces.    Over a medium heat saute the onion in butter or margarine.  When the  onion is soft, add mustard seeds.  When seeds start jumping, add  turmeric, cumin, and coriander powders.  Saute onion again until it  is fully covered with spices.    Add string beans first.  Mix and cover them for 4 minutes.    Then add zucchini next.  Stir the pan.  Add chili powder, garlic  powder, and salt.  Cook for 8 to 10 minutes.    Serve hot or warm as a side dish.    Anadi Naik in "Vegetarian Journal Reports"  Posted by Karen Mintzias    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/vegan4.zip
