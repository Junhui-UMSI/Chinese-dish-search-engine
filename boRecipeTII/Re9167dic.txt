Lightly beaten egg, Vegetable oil, Caraway seeds (optional), Rye flour, Buttermilk, Salt, Black Pepper, Molasses, Flour, Shredded provolone cheese, Dijon-style mustard, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Worcestershire Sauce, 
Preheat oven to 400F, prepare pans. In a large bowl, stir together flour,  baking powder & soda & salt; stir in cheese to coat. In another bowl, stir  together buttermilk, oil, egg, molasses, mustard, seeds, w/sauce & pepper  until blended. Add dry mix to wet mix until just combined. Spoon into pans  & bake for 15-20 mins, or until done. Makes 12 muffins.    To non-Americans: Molasses is treacle but I dont know what sort of cheese  provolone may be similar to. I always thought provolone was some sort of a  luncheon sausage ;-)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
