Venison in Crockpot
black pepper, Ground sage, Cream of mushroom soup, Venison roast, Dried red pepper, Worchestire sauce, Lipton onion soup, Sherry, bacon, 
Rub roast with sage and pepper. In order (and do not stir), place these  ingredients in crock pot. Roast, sprinkle with red pepper, onion soup mix,  worchestire sauce, and sherry. Layer bacon over meat and spread on the  cream of mushroom soup. Let cook on medium for 6 - 8 hours. I serve over  rice....This is to die for!...I have made it with a pork roast, but  substituted the amount of bacon, being that venison has almost no fat! so  go light on the bacon (I have even used bacon bits with the pork for the  low cholesteral ppl in the family.) It can even be adapted to add patatoes  onions and carrots....It is great on cold days.....    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 180 by molony <molony@scsn.net>  on Oct 29, 1997
