From: wilson@cluster.unca.edu    Date: 1 Dec 1995 20:34:35 -0700  Cream butter (or shortening) and sugar.  Add egg yolks, one at a time, and  beat between each addition.  Add vanilla and then alternately add the dry  ingredients and milk.  Fold in beaten egg whites.  Put batter in a greased  tube pan.  Bake at 325 F until light golden brown, about 1 1/4 hours.    Notes:  Buttermilk may be substituted for milk Eggs may be added at the  first, unseparated.  If making layers (3), bake at 350 for 30 minutes.    My grandmother used this recipe for a geranium cake where she would first  line the "well- greased" pan with scented geranium leaves.
