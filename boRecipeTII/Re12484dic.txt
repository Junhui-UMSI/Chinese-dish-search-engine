Zydeco Green Beans is actually a redundancy.  The exuberant music of  Louisianas black French-speaking Creoles is called zydeco, an idiomatic  phonetic version of les haricots, French for snap beans. Serve these green  beans as a relish, or as "stirrers" for Bloody Marys.  ~------------------------------------------------------ ~-----------------  In a large saucepan, stir together the water, vinegar, sugar, mustard  seeds, garlic, bay leaves, salt and Tabasco sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce  the heat, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the beans. Cover and simmer  for 10 minutes, until tender-crisp. Arrange the beans in a shallow dish and  cover them completely with the vinegar mixture.  Cover and refrigerate  overnight.  Serve cold.    From: The Tabasco Cookbook.
