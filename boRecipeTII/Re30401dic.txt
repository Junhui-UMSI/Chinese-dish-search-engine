Banana Flour
Ripe Bananas, 
Slice and dry full grown bananas. Use only the fruit that is full grown as  green bananas contain too much starch. After drying, grind or pound in a  mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. This flour can be used in  equal parts with regular flour in making desserts where a starchy substance  is used.    From: Real Guamanian Recipes By Way Of Dorothys Kitchen By: Dorothy Horn
