Apricot and Pecan Crumble
Dried whole apricots;, Margarine, Wholemeal flour, Marmalade, Soft brown sugar, Oat flakes, Pecan nuts, 
1. Soak the apricots for 3-4 hours in 1/2pint / 300ml hot water. Bring to  the boil in the same water. Cover and cook for 20 minutes. The apricots  should be fairly soft.    2. Mix in the marmalade. Then put the mixture including all the liquid into  a greased oven-proof dish. Add a little more water if necessary to cover  the fruit.    3. To make the crumble topping, rub the margarine into the flour, then add  the oats and sugar. Reserve 8 pecan nuts and grind the rest coarsely. Add  these to the crumble mixture.    4. Sprinkle the mixture on the fruit. Arrange the whole pecan nuts on top.  Bake the crumble at 350=F8F/180=F8C/gas mark 4 for 20-25 minutes. Serve  hot.        NOTES : Apricots and marmalade make a tangy combination which works well in  a fruit crumble.          Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Alan Hewitt <alan@atoc.demon.co.uk> on Nov  24, 1998
