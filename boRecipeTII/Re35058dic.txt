Beans Sauteed with Garlic
Sunflower oil, Water, String Beans, Salt and pepper, Fat Clove of Garlic, 
Take a handful of beans, lay them flat and cut of the ends. Do the same  with the other end, then the rest of the beans. Wash them. Heat the oil in  a large frying pan, preferably one in which you can lay all the beans in  one layer, and put in the beans and finely chopped garlic. Turn for two or  three minutes until well coated in garlic and oil. Pour in just enough  water to cover and turn the heat up to maximum. The water will boil away as  the beans cook - it will take no more than seven or eight minutes. Once the  beans started to sizzle as the water boils away, sprinkle them generously  with salt and black pepper. When the water has completely evaporated the  beans are ready.
