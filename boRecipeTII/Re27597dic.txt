The Best Mayonnaise and Variations
Dry mustard, White vinegar, Fresh Lemon Juice, Salt, Corn oil, Eggs, Sugar, 
Put all the ingredients and 2/3 cup of oil in the completely dry processor  bowl. Process about 5-10 seconds. With processor running, add remaining 1  1/3 cups of the oil. Process only until the mixture is thick and smooth  (about 10 to 15 seconds.)    Variations: Dill Mayonnaise (great on cold salmon) Add 4 tablespoons of  chopped fresh dill to basic mayonnaise recipe.    Hot Herbed Mayonnaise: Good with vegetables, especially artichokes. Warm  mayonnaise in top of double boiler. Stir in *finely* chopped fresh  tarragon, and/or chervil, and/or parsley, and/or chives. (Soak dried herbs  in a little lemon juice if no fresh are available.) Serve from a warmed  bowl. (It can also be served cold.)
