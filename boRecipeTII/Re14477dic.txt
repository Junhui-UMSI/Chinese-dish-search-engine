I mix it up, then cook a pot of it by measuring 2 cups of cereal to 5 cups  of water, bringing it to boil, & then letting it sit over night. Then I  have a bowlful each morning, heated in the microwave until the cooked  cereal is gone and I need to make more. Or you could do the same with a  smaller amount, for one serving, say, try 1/4 cup of cereal. Its very  chewy and satisfying. And of course lots of whole grains. Sometimes I just  use oatmeal instead of oat groats, since they are difficult to find and I  like the consistency that oatmeal adds. In the book he has a little  paragraph about each grain, explaining what vitamins/minerals it has & what  its good for.
