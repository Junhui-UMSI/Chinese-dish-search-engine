Place flour in a bowl.  Add boiling water; stirring with chopsticks or a  fork.  Gradually stir in cold water, mixing until dough holds together. On  a lightly floured board, knead dough until smooth and satiny, about 5  minutes.  Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.  Combine filling ingredients  in a bowl; mix well.  On a lightly floured board, roll dough into a  cylinder, then cut into 18 portions.  To make each coin, roll a portion of  dough into a 3 1/2" circle about 1/2" thick; keep remaining dough covered  to prevent drying.  Place a rounded tbsp of filling in center of dough.  Gather edges of dough around filling; pinch to seal. Roll filled dough into  a ball; flatten with the palm of your hand until 1/2" thick. Place a wide  frying pan over medium heat until hot. Add 2 tbsp oil, swirling to coat  sides.  Add coins, half at a time, and cook until golden brown on both  sides, 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
