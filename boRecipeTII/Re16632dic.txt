Roast the peppers and eggplant over charcoal or gas flame, or bake in a  preheated oven at 475 deg. F until the skins are blistered and black. Place  the roasted vegetables in a paper bag and let them steam in their own heat  for 10 minutes. Peel off and discard the burnt skins along with the stems  and seeds. Mash the pepper and eggplant pulp together to form a homogeneous  mass, either smooth or slightly chunky, as desired.    Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet and saute the onion until very  soft. Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes lomger. Remove from heat and stir  in the pepper-eggplant pulp, mixing well. Slowly drizzle remaining oil into  the mixture, stirring constantly to incorporate all the oil. Add lemon  juice and vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and  garnish with parsley.    Serve as an appetizer spread on thick slices of country-style white  bread, or flat pita bread, or use as a side dish to accompany grilled or  roasted meats.    Source: Chile Pepper
