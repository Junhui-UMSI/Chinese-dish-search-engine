Tofu "Ranch" Dip
Hidden Valley Salad Dressing, Apple cider vinegar, Mori-nu silken Tofu, water, 
I have served this at parties, and no one seemed to be aware that it wasnt  REAL Ranch dip ; )    Tastes just like I remember.  Vegans beware, I think that I remember that  there was some kind of milk by-product like whey or something in it, but if  you avoid dairy for allergies, it doesnt seem to bother mine YMMV.
