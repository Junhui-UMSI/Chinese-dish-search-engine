Two-Ingredient Chicken
Chicken, whole, Chicken Tonight Sweet&Spicy, 
Remove giblets from inside chicken.  Pour 1 cup of sauce inside cavity.  Place chicken breast-down in crockpot. Pour remaining sauce over chicken.  Add 1/2 cup molasses or honey, if desired. Cook until done.    Sylvias comments: this was a desperation recipe I concocted this morning  (as in "I dont have time to seriously season this chicken, what can I pour  on it FAST?") that came out absolutely delicious. The kids inhaled it and  Ive been nibbling in between refilling their plates. Its almost like the  Hunters Chicken Ive been trying to duplicate. There was lots of sauce in  the pot, which would be great to defat and serve over rice or macaroni.
