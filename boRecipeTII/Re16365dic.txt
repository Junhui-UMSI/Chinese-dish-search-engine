Websters North Carolina Bbq Ribs
Chili powder, Vinegar, Salt, Powdered mustard, Black pepper, SAUCE, Water, Garlic powder, Ground cumin, 
This is enough sauce for 9 lbs. of ribs (for 6 persons) allowing 1 1/2  lbs of pork ribs per person.     Adjust the fire to a "five-second" temperature; that is, you should be  able to hold you hand where the meat will be for 5 seconds.     Cooking Time:  Skinny ribs-50 min.; average ribs-60 min.; meaty ribs- 70  min.  Every 2-3 minutes, stir the sauce to keep it from settling, baste the  ribs and turn them. The sauce should run out 4-6 min. before the end or the  cooking time so that the last turn on each side should be "dry." Check the  temperature frequently and keep it as even as possible for the entire  cooking time.  A covered grill is desirable for temperature controll and  also improves the flavor by smoking the meat as the the cooking proceeds.  Thee success of this recipe depends on slow cooking at a moderate  temperature, with frequent basting.  Grease flare-ups should be suppressed  with water to avoid charring.     In some parts of North Carolina, a liquid resembling water is used for  refreshment, fueling cars and other purposes. Do not accidentally use it  for suppressing the fire unless you want to finish your meal in Georgia.
