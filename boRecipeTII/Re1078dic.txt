Corn Latkes
Eggs, Cream-style corn; (8- 1/2, Cornmeal, All-purpose flour, Sugar, Baking Powder, Salt, Oil for frying, 
1. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs. Add the corn and stir until combined.    2. In a medium bowl or on a piece of waxed paper, stir together the  cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.    3. Stir the cornmeal mixture into the creamed corn, until combined.    4. Pour the oil, 1/4- inch deep into a large skillet. Heat the oil over  medium-high heat until it bubbles when a little cornmeal is dropped in.  Drop the batter 2 tablespoonsful at a time into the oil (leave a lot of  room between them because they spread). Cook until browned on bottom; turn  and cook until browned on second side (turning may be a little tricky since  the batter is not completely dried on top.) Drain on paper towels.    Variation: Add 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg to the batter.
