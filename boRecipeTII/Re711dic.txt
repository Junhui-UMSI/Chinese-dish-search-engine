Here is my favorite green salad. I add some tuna in brine and have a nice  lunch suitable for this HOT summer.    Combine all mayo, dill, vinegar and oil and toss with vegetables. You can  add salt & pepper if you like.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "shoshana kessel" <shoshana_k@hotmail.com>  on Aug 12, 1998,
