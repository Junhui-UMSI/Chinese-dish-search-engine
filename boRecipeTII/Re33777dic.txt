Sweet and Sour Garlic Chicken Breasts
Water, Honey, butter, Garlic, Chicken, skinless, Lemon juice, Pepper flakes, hot, 
Simmer all, except the chicken,  in a saute pan until it is liquid.  Add  the chicken and turn the temperature up to medium-high.  Continuously ladel  the sauce over the chicken until it is cooked and the sauce is golden  brown.    If the glaze is carmelizing too fast, add a bit of water to mellow it out.    For each additional chicken breast, double the ingredients.
