Clean and then julienne mushrooms.  Melt butter and gently saute the  mushroom mixture with chopped onion. Add cognac. When the cognac is warm,  light it with a match and allow the flame to die naturally (flambe). Add  red wine. Let the liquid penetrate the vegetables. Remove mixture and drain  (dont squeeze). Add ham, if desired, and mix.  Beat eggs and add cream,  creme fraiche, garlic basil, thyme and rosemary. Mix well. Add salt and  pepper to taste.    Butter a (preferably) round lasagne pan. Cover bottom with cooked lasagne  noodles (or lasagne noodles that dont need to be precooked), then cover  with 1/4 of the mushroom mixture and then a thin layer of the egg mixture.  Repeat this three times and cover the last layer of egg mixture with 1.5 oz  of older cheese.    Cook the lasagne in a 150 Celsius (300 Fahrenheit) oven for roughly 40  minutes or until golden brown.
