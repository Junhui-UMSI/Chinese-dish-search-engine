This is a moist & rich tasting chocolate cake. The recipe is from my Dad`s  wife, Doreen. It`s so good that you don`t even need to frost it!!    Mix all the dry ingredients. Mix the eggs, oil & milk & combine with the  dry ingredients. Grease or spray 8x8 pan Bake at 350` for 40-45 minutes.  After cooling, keep refrigerated.    Just a warning...this cake won`t last long...it`s delicious!! You can  double the recipe if you want to!    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "leah perez" <perezleah@hotmail.com> on Aug  02, 1998,
