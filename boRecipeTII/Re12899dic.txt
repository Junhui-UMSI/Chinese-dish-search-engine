* Can be made from fresh or dried coconut or purchased bottled. Do not use  the canned coconut mix for mixed drinks as it is very sweet and different.  If using fresh coconut, cut coconut meat into 1" pieces & place equal  amounts of coconut & hot water in food processor or blender. Puree at high  speed for a couple of minutes, let steep for 30 minutes. Then pour into a  strainer set over a bowl. Press on the pulp and squeeze by the handful to  extract as milk as possible. Pour the milk through a fine-mesh strainer.  For dried coconut: use 1 cup unsweetened, dried coconut with 1 1/2 c hot  tap water. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Puree one minute and proceed as  above. Will keep up to three days refrigerated and indefinitely, if frozen.    "Theres a beautiful vegetarian restaurant called Zemis on the beach in  Phillipsburg, St. Maarten.."
