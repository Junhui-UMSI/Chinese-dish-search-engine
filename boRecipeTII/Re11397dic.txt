cinnamon, juice and zest of 1 lime, green cardamom, Port Wine, Salt and fresh ground pepper, Orange Blossom honey, Whole black peppercorn, Boneless Moscovy Hen Duck, Allspice, Star anise, juice and zest of 1 lemon, clove, 
from Chef David Kinch or Sent Sovi    Preparation:    1. Using a sharp knife, trim and remove the sinew and membrane from the  underside of the duck. With the skin side down trim off any excess skin and  fat from around the perimeter of the breast.    2. Flip over each breast and score the skin by cutting through the skin  without cutting the meat in diagonal lines    3. Place the honey and port wine in a non reactive pot and bring to a  simmer, making sure to skim off any impurities rising to the surface.  Reduce by exactly half.    4. When the honey/port mixture is reduced, add all the spices, juices and  zests. Let cool to room temperature - Strain.    5. Pre-heat oven to 425 F.    6. Place a saute pan on a medium flame and season the duck breast with salt  and few turns of a pepper mill on both sides. When the pan is hot place the  breast skin side down and slightly reduce the heat. The breast will  immediately start to render its fat and prevent the breast from sticking.    7. When the breasts are golden brown, turn them in the pan to remove the  visible rawness and remove from the pan when the breasts are still very  rare.    8. Brush the duck breasts on the skin side liberally with the spiced honey  and place in the oven to cook to a perfect medium rare (approx. 2 minutes)  and allow the honey to take on a shiny, lacquered finish. Allow to rest for        2    minutes before slicing.    9. Slice the duck breast into thin (1/4") pieces and fan out on a warm  plate.    This duck preparation works well in a salad with greens, or as an entree.  At Restaurant Sent Sov it is served with Sauteed Apples and a Savory  Fennel Cake.
