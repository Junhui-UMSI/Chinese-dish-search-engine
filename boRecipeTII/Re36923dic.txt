Strawberry Spring Salad
White wine vinegar, Water, Honey, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Salt, Pepper, Strawberries, quartered, Italian Blend salad greens, Pine nuts, roasted, 
Combine first 6 ingredients (white wine vinegar, water, honey, oil, salt and pepper) and stir well with a whisk. Combine strawberries and greens.  Add the vinegar mix; toss to coat. Sprinkle with  nuts.    I used slivered toasted almonds and added some finely diced red onion. It  was very good and so easy to make.
