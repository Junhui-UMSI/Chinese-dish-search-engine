Potato Butter Horn Rolls
Sugar, Melted shortening, Eggs, well beaten, Hot mashed potatoes, Salt, Flour, milk, Cake compressed yeast, 
Add sugar, salt, and shortening to freshly prepared hot mashed potatoes.  Cool, and add eggs.  Soften yeast in milk and add the potato mixture. Add  flour, a little at a time, beating well after each addition. Turn onto  lightly floured board.  Knead until smooth and elastic. (The dough should  be as soft as it is possible to handle.) Cover with a damp cloth, set in a  warm place and allow to double in bulk. Turn onto lightly floured board.  Roll in round sheet 1/2 inch thick. Cut into sections as you would cut a  pie, having each section about 3 inches wide at the outer edge. Begin at  the outside and roll each section toward the center. Form into crescents.  Place on well-oiled baking sheet. Cover with a warm, damp cloth. Let rise  until treble in bulk. Bake in hot oven (450 F) about 12 minutes. 32 rolls.  Mrs. Jessie Kelsey, Lakeland, FL.
