Crimp the edges with a pastry sealer or a  fork. Repeat for the other pear halves and bake until golden brown and  well-risen. Put strawberries, confectioners sugar and cream into a blender  or processor and run until smooth. To serve finished pastry, put a few  tablespoons of strawberry puree on a plate, put pastry on top and serve  warm or at room temperature. Variations: Put a small, rolled-out piece of  marzipan inside the pastry with the pear. Or golden raisins. Or some  chopped strawberry. Marinate the pear halves in maple syrup for several  hours before assembling the pastry. Or marinate in Maraschino, strawberry  or raspberry liqueurs. Or mix chopped pear and peaches, plums or apricots.  A dab of good vanilla ice cream alongside. Served on a pool of pastry  cream.
