"Irish Coffee" Cake
Sugar (for coffee syrup), IRISH COFFEE SYRUP, Coffee essence**, Irish whiskey, ICING, Whiskey, or to taste, Strong black coffee, Chopped nuts*, CAKE, Eggs, Butter, at room temperature, Granulated sugar, Self-raising flour, Heavy whipping cream, 
*Or grated chocolate. **This is a concentrated, liquid coffee easily found  in Ireland, but probably not in the States. I would dissolve 2 T of a good  instant coffee (Tasters Choice or something similar) in an equivalent  amount of water, and use that. -- Grease and flour an 8-inch cake pan  (preferably a springform cheesecake pan). Preheat oven to 350F. Cream the  butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs, adding a  little flour and beating well after each addition. Stir in the coffee  essence, and mix thoroughly. Turn the mixture into the prepared pan, and  bake for 35-40 minutes until springy to the touch. Turn out and cool on a  wire rack. . To make the Irish coffee syrup, put the coffee and sugar into  a small pan and bring up to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Then  boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and add the whiskey. . Wash and dry the  pan the cake was baked in, and return the cooled cake to it: then pour the  hot coffee syrup all over it. Leave in a cool place for several hours, then  turn out. Whip the cream until its thick, sweeten slightly with  confectioners sugar, and add whiskey to taste. Spread the cake with the  whipped cream and chill for an hour before sprinkling with chopped nuts or  grated chocolate.
