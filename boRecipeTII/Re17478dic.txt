Salt, Eggs, Sour cream, Coarse yellow cornmeal, milk, Canned corn kernels, Unsalted butter, Maple syrup, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Baking Powder, Water, 
Combine the cornmeal and the water in a saucepan. Constantly stir the  mixture while it cooks until smooth and thick. Add butter to the  cornmeal/water mixture, continue stirring. Set the mixture aside to cool  sligthly.    Mix the dry ingredients: in a bowl combine flour, salt, baking powder and  baking soda...mix well...set aside. Into the cooled cornmeal mixture, add 2  lightly beaten eggs, milk, sour cream and the maple syrup.    Gently fold the flour mixture and the corn into the pan of cornmeal, stir  well.    Drop the batter by tablespoons into a preheated, pre-greased griddle. Cook  until bubbles form and edges set (approx. 1 minute) then flip and cook  until golden.
