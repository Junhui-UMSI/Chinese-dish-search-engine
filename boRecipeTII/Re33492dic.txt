Sushi Rice #1
Mirin, Rice vinegar, Salt, Japanese white rice, Water, 
Gently rinse the rice a couple of times until the water is clear.  Drain it  in a colander for half an hour.  Place the rice and water in a heavy pot  covered tightly with a lid.  Cook over medium-high heat for 10 minutes  until steam escapes the lid. Immediately turn the heat to low and cook for  10 - 15 minutes, until all the water has been absorbed. Remove from the  heat and let the rice stand, covered, for 10 minutes.    In the meantime, heat the mirin, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan  until the salt is dissolved.    Put the cooked rice in a large mixing bowl.  While vigorously fanning the  rice to cool it (newspapers or a small electric fan is useful, not to  mention a friend), slowly stir in the mirin mixture. Continue stirring and  fanning until the rice is cool. Makes 4 cups.
