Preheat an oven to 375 degrees. Using a sharp knife remove the corn from  the ear and place the cut corn into a bowl. Add the red pepper and onion to  the corn. Combine the milk and eggs and whisk well. Add the salt, pepper  and cayenne to the milk, pour the corn mixture into the milk and stir well.  Lightly butter a large casserole, individual souffle dishes or pudding cups  with the butter. Pour the milkcorn mixture into the souffle dishes and  place into a roasting pan. The puddings will be baked in a water bath to  keep them light and delicate. Place the pan on the middle shelf of the oven  and fill the roasting pan halfway with warm water. Cover the pan with  aluminum foil and push the rack back into the oven. Cook the puddings for  35 to 40 minutes or until the puddings are firm but not rubbery.    Yield: 4 to 6 portions    c.
