In a  medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter until well  blended.  Press evenly into a buttered 9-inch pie pan, reaching up to but  not over the rim. Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool the  crust completely on a wire rack.    Filling: Beat the cream cheese and peanut butter with an electric mixer at  medium speed until well blended.  Add the confectioners sugar, butter and  vanilla and continue beating until fluffy.  Whip the cream until not quite  stiff.  Fold a large spoonful of the whipped cream into the peanut butter  mixture to lighten it; gently fold in the remainder.  Carefully spoon the  filling into the cooled crust, spreading evenly.  Loosely cover the pie and  refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours.  (You can put it in the freezer, if  youd like to speed it up.    Fudge Topping: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small, heavy saucepan.  Add  the chocolate and stir until smooth.  Set aside to cool to lukewarm. Gently  spread the topping over the cooled pie.  Refrigerate until firm, about 3  hours.  (This pie can be made 1 day ahead; cover it loosely with wax paper  or plastic wrap and refrigerate.)    Cut the pie into wedges and serve cold.
