If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water for 1  minute, then into cold water.    To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with a  hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever the tail  where it joins the head with a heavy knife.  Cut the tail into rings,  slicing through the shell between the ribs.    Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove and  discard the gritty stomach sac.  Pour the coral (if any) and the green  matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl, sprinkle with salt  and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.    In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce, fry  the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until translucent. Add  the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and liquid, wine, orange juice,  and bay leaf.  Season and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.    Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail pieces  and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer, covered, for 10  minutes.    In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the  strainer and beat the pur?e with the remaining olive oil.  When the lobster  has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and beat this into  the coral pur?e.  Pour this back into the pot, stir, and simmer for another  10 minutes.  Serve with saffron rice.
