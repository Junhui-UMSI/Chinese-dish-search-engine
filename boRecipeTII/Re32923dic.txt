Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to the boil,  add the sweet potatoes, and cook until they are fork tender, about 10  minutes. Drain the potatoes, then mash them with the milk and cinnamon. Set  aside. Pour the oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the  onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove  the onion wiht a slotted spoon to a small bowl, and set aside. Add the  garlic to the skillet and cook 2 minutes. Crumble in the ground beef; cook  until browned. Drain. Stir in the tomatoes and vegetables, then the bread  crumbs. Spoon the meat mixture into a 10-inch round baking pan. Mix the  spinach with the apple cider vinegar. Cover the meat with the spinach, and  scatter the onions on top. Spread the sweet potatoes evenly over the  casserole. Bake until the sweet optatoes begin to brown, about 30 minutes.  Cool slightly before serving to small children. :-)    NOTES : Ryan *and* Ron loved this when Ryan was a toddler.  Nostalgia  factor! If your refrigerator is filled with small amounts of leftover  vegetables, this is a delectable way to use them up. The recipe doubles or  triples well. Freeze the extra. Refrigerates well up to 4 days. If you  dont have small children to worry about, you neednt mash the peas, or  dice the veggies. Chopped would be fine.
