Pineapple Cupcakes
Vegetable oil, Eggs, French vanilla cake mix, crushed pineapple in juices, 
Follow directions on box, but instead of water, put in a can of crushed  pineapple in juice. Blend for 30 seconds on low. Then beat for 2 minutes on  medium. Bake in cupcake tins for 15 - 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Frost with  vanilla or cream cheese frosting. They are amazingly moist!    Note - I have used regular vanilla cake mix and white cake mix. All are  good, but my favorite is French vanilla. For egg and oil amounts follow box  instructions. Whats listed here is for a Betty Crocker mix.
