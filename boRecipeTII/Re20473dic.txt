NOTE: No instructions came with recipe--Glen    If you ARE referring to the Cabbage Soup diet recommended for severely  overweight surgery patients, then you are also referring to the Cabbage  Soup diet that is one of the most UNHEALTHY ways to lose weight! This is  for people for whom it is a matter of LIFE and DEATH, not for the average  overweight Joe. For one, it doesnt provide the necessary nutrition for the  "average" American, and for two, unless you stay on the diet (VERY bad  idea), you will quickly regain the weight you lost.    This is an excerpt from an article at:  ://www.americanheart.org/Health/Risk_Factors/Overweight/Fad_Diets/release.h  tml    "Many fad diets, like the cabbage soup diet, take advantage of peoples  desire for instant results by creating the myth that certain foods - in  this case cabbage - have magical weight loss properties," says Robert H.  Eckel, M.D., a member of the American Heart Associations Nutrition  Committee and professor of medicine and physiology at the University of  Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.
