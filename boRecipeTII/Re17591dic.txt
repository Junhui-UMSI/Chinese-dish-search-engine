Almond Horns
Egg Whites; (up to 2), Dark Chocolate, Marzipan, 10X; (Confectioners)Sugar, Sliced Almonds, 
Blend marzipan, sugar and egg whites, and stir together until the dough is  evenly blended. Pour the sliced almonds out onto a plate. Form the dough  into small horns (crescents). Roll horns carefully in the almonds and place  them on baking paper (parchment paper) on a cookie sheet.    Bake horns for 10-12 minutes at 200 C (400 F). Melt chocolate in a double  boiler and dip the ends of the horns in the warm chocolate. Place horns on  parchment paper and allow chocolate to cool and solidify.    Makes about 20 horns.  NOTE: If desired, you could brush the unbaked almond horns with an  eggwhite/sugar wash to make them shiny and a little sweeter. I dont, but  it is always an option.
