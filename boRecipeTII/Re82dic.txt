Kfc Coleslaw
Cabbage, milk, Carrot, Mayonnaise, Granulated sugar, Buttermilk, Salt, White vinegar, Pepper, Lemon juice, 
Mix milk, mayonnaise, sugar, buttermilk, salt and lemon juice and beat  until smooth. Add the cabbage and carrots. Mix well.    Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hrs. before serving.    The critical part of this cole slaw recipe is the flavor-enhancement period  prior to eating. Be absolutely certain the cole slaw sits in the fridge  for at least a couple of hrs. prior to serving for a great-tasting slaw.
