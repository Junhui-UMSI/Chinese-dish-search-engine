Recipe By : Lorna Sass; Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure    Here are a few I got from Dr. Gabe Mirkins website.    Note: Lorna Sass created this recipe to be cooked in a pressure cooker. If  you dont have one, just cook on the stove top. Quinoa is done when it has  just a bit of crunch and has developed a little "tail" on the seed during  cooking. The only modification I made to her original recipe was to delete  the 1 T. of oil she suggested adding when you stir in the basil and lemon  juice.    Bring water to the boil in the pressure cooker. Add the quinoa, green  beans, tomatoes, garlic and salt.    Lock the lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure and cook for  1 minute. Allow the pressure to come down naturally for 10 minutes.  Quick-release any remaining pressure. Remove the lid, tilting it away from  you to allow any excess steam to escape.    Stir in the basil and lemon juice and fluff up the quinoa just before  serving. Great hot, room temperature or cold.    Note: If you use canned tomatoes, reduce the salt by 1/2. If you use frozen  green beans, defrost them and add them at the end when you add the basil  and lemon juice, otherwise they will be overdone.
