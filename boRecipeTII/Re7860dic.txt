The recipe is from "Bread Machine Magic" by  Linda Rehberg and Lois Conway.    Place all ingredients except egg white in bread pan, select Dough setting,  and press start. When dough has risen long enough, the machine will beep.  Turn off bread machine, remove bread pan, and turn out dough onto a floured  countertop or cutting board. Grease an 8- or 9- inch pie tin. Gently roll  and stretch the dough into a 30-inch rope of even thickness from one end to  the other. Starting at one end and working to the other, gently twist the  rope. Place one end of the twisted rope of dough in the center of the  greased pie tine; carefully coil the rest of the rope around the center,  filling the pan. Cover and let rise in warm oven at least 1 hour until  doubled. (Hint: To warm oven slightly, turn oven on Warm setting for 2  minutes, then turn it off, and place covered dough in oven to rise. Remove  pan from oven to preheat). Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Brush dough with  egg white. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until brown. Remove from oven, cool on  rack in pan. When cool, remove from pan, thinly slice, and serve.    MM-RECIPES@IDISCOVER.NET    MEAL-MASTER RECIPES LIST SERVER    MM-RECIPES DIGEST V3 #93    From the MealMaster recipe list.
