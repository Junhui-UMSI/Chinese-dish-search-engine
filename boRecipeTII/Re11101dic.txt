Raised Sausage Meat and Egg Pie
Frozen Puff Pastry, Onion, Egg, Soft White Bread Crumbs, Pork Sausage Meat, Eggs; Hard-boiled, Sage, 
Grease an oblong loaf or cake tin. Roll out thawed pastry into a large  oblong about the thickness of a penny. Cut off a piece of pastry to fit top  of loaf and reserve. Use remainder to line base and sides of tin.    In a mixing bowl, combine sausagemeat, onion, sage and breadcrumbs. Bind  with beaten egg, reserving a little for glazing pastry. Turn mixture into  pastry-lined tin and press hard-boiled eggs down in the centre, covering  them with sausagemeat.    Put on pastry lid. Trim corners and seal edges. Roll out trimmings and cut  decorative "leaves". Make a small hole in centre of pie to allow steam to  escape. Flute edges of pastry. Brush with reserved beaten egg, put pastry  leaves in position, and brush these, too. Bake in a pre-heated, hot oven  (425 F, gas mark 6) for 10 to 15 minutes until pastry has set. Then reduce  heat to moderate (375F gas mark 4) and continue baking for a further 30  minutes. Serve hot with cooked vegetables, or serve cold with salad or  pickles.
