Baked Chicken Breasts
Chicken breast, Cream of chicken soup,, Butter or margarine, Garlic powder, Tarragon, mushrooms  , Worcestershire Sauce, Dry sherry, 
Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in Crock-Pot.  In a saucepan,  combine remaining ingredients and heat until smooth and hot.  Pour over  chicken breasts.  Cover and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours.  (I did  it on higher heat to speed things up. I added boiled potatoes and some  paprika towards the end.) For the first time ever, I used those frozen  boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to  cook with soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this recipe,  you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is delish!!!

Hint:       Rivals recipe       called for 4 ounces of mushrooms, but I doubled the quantity.  You       could       leave them out if you dont like mushrooms.  I had no Cream of       Chicken soup       and subd Cream of Celery.  It was soooooo goooood that I think       Ill just       stick with Celery in the future!!
