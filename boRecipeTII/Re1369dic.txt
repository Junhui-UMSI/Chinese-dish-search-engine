Easy-Bake Scalloped Potatoes
Potatoes; peeled and thinly, Mexican-flavored processed, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place one third of teh cheese cubes in the  bottom of 9x13" baking dish that has been coated with nonstick vegetable  spray.  Cover with half of the potatoes, then layer another third of the  cheese cubes over the potatoes.  Top with the remaining potatoes and  cheese.  Cover tightly with foil and bake for 60 minutes, or until the  potatoes are tender and the cheese is melted. Remove the foil and return  the dish to the oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the top is golden. Note:  If Mexican-flavored cheese is not available, use plain processed cheese  spread and add 1/2 cup salsa.  It would be best to melt the cheese first so  you can mix the salsa in and the toss with the potatoes and bake as  directed.
