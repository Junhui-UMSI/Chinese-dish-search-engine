Turkey Tacos
olive oil, Turkey scallops, Salt, Refried black beans, Pepper, Avocado; sliced, Corn tortillas, Pickled shallots, Red salsa, 
Combine turkey scallops in a mixing bowl with oil, salt and pepper. Heat  the grill or dry cast iron pan over high heat until smoking. Sear the  turkey slices about half a minute per side. Transfer to a cutting board.  Chop into 1/2 inch strips and reserve in a bowl with the juices from the  board. To make tacos, toast the tortillas. For each serving, stack 2  tortillas and spread with a layer of black beans. Top with seared turkey  strips, a tablespoon each of salsa and pickled shallots, and avocado  slices. Roll and serve hot. Yield: 4 servings Thinly sliced turkey,  well-seasoned and panseared, makes an excellent quick taco filling. These  actually bear more resemblance to authentic Mexican food than all those  crisp, ground beef filled tacos. This recipe can be assembled quickly from  things it is easy to keep in the house, but can be adapted to include  leftovers in your refrigerator. If you have only pink beans use them  instead; add tomato slices if you have them, or other pickled vegetables  instead of the shallots.
