For Sesame-Chili Sauce, in a small saucepan combine all of the ingredients  except chicken. Cook over medium heat till bubbly, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 5   minutes. Set aside. Rinse chicken;  pat dry with paper towels. If desired, remove skin from chicken and  discard.  If using quartered chickens, break wing, hip, and drumstick  joints so the bird will lie   flat during cooking. Twist wing tips under  backs. Place chicken, skin side down, on an uncovered grill directly over  MEDIUM coals. Grill for 20 minutes. Turn; grill 15 to 25 minutes more or  till tender and no longer pink. Brush with sauce frequently during the last  10 minutes of grilling. Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Heat any  remaining sauce either on the grill or stove top; pass with chicken.  Make-ahead tip:  The Sesame-Chili Sauce can be made up to 5 days ahead and  stored, covered, in the refrigerator.
