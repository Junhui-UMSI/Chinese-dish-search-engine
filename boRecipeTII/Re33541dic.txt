In a glass bowl, marinate in soy sauce for no more than  20 minutes. Just before cooking, coat the chicken pieces with cornstarch.    Heat (circulon) wok, adding oils to coat well. Fry the chicken in batches;  shaking off excess cornstarch, and moving cooked pieces up the sides of the  wok. (Save the empty marinade bowl for the sauce.) When chicken is no  longer pink, add the peppers, garlic and red pepper flakes (or fresh  ginger). Fry a few minutes. Add mushrooms and fry 2 minutes. Season with  "Mixed Ground Pepper Corns." Add 1/2 teaspoon of Southeast Asian Fish Sauce  (optional). Add cashews.    Using the marinade bowl with the leftover cornstarch, add the broth and  water and additional soy sauce. Dissolve the cornstarch. Make a well in the  wok.  Pour solution in middle and heat, stirring until well-cooked and  thickened.  Serve at once over rice.    COOKsNOTE: If pepper strips are frozen, thaw in sieve, rinse with cold  water, then blot dry between many layers of paper towels.    Serving Ideas : Menu: Steamed Rice and Chicken Peppers Cashew    NOTES : Swanson has introduced an Oriental Broth - a sweetened version of  its vegetable broth. First tried 17Ap96 with this classic. Success: sauce  was lighter and less salty than classic.    MC-RECIPE@MASTERCOOK.COM    MASTERCOOK RECIPES LIST SERVER    MC-RECIPE DIGEST V1 #48    From the MasterCook recipe list.
