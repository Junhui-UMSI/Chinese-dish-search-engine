Thai Pork Curry
Peanut oil, Red curry paste, garlic, Pork tenderloin, baby corn, fresh ginger, Basil leaves, Cilantro, Zest of 1 lime, Coconut milk, Habanero pepper, Sugar, Serrano peppers, Thai fish sauce, 
Here is another Thai dish that I have been doing for many years:    Heat wok to medium high, add oil, add curry paste, stir fry until heat hits  you, up heat and add pork, continue stir frying, for a couple of minutes,  then stir in coconut milk, toss in lime zest, ginger and garlic, bring to  boil, cut heat and simmer until pork is tender. Stir in fish sauce, sugar,  peppers and baby corn, drained...if this is too runny at this point add 1  tbls corn starch mixed in a little water,cook until thickened then add  basil and cilantro leaves...Serve with any good rice, but fragrant jasmine  rice is best with any Thai dish...This is a fabulous dish, with a fair  amount of heat...hope you enjoy it and the others I have been throwing at  you...Cheers, Doug in BC    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Doug Irvine <dirvin@bc.sympatico.ca> on Apr  25, 1998
