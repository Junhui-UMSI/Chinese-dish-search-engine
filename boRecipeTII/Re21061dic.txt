Twice-Baked Ratatouille-Stuffed Potatoes
Onion, Garlic, Balsamic vinegar or cider, Plum tomatoes; diced, Eggplant, Nonfat ricotta cheese, Vegetable oil spray, Zucchini; diced, Red bell pepper; cut into, Baking potatoes, Nonfat Parmesan cheese, 
Cube the eggplant, toss with salt, and arranged in a single layer, if  possible, in a large colander.  Let drain for 20 minutes. Pat dry with  paper towels.    Bake or microwave the potatoes until soft.    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.    In a large nonstick skillet lightly sprayed with oil, in a few tablespoons  water, over medium-high heat, combine the onion, garlic, and eggplant;  cover and steam for 4 minutes, adding more water if necessary to prevent  sticking. Add the pepper, zucchini, tomatoes, and vinegar. Reduce the heat,  cover, and simmer 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the  vegetables are tender.    Meanwhile, slice off the top third of the potatoes lengthwise, and with a  spoon, scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch shell. (Reserve the flesh  for another use.) Spoon 2 tablespoons ricotta into each potato. Fill the  potatoes with the ratatouille. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons Parmesan and  bake 35 minutes.    Alternatively, place the potatoes in a microwave-safe dish, cover with wax  paper, and cook at high for 4 minutes, rotating once.

You can use your own homemade, or to simplify, use       canned or jarred ratatouille.
