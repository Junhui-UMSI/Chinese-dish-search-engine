Welsh Cakes
Salt, Eggs, Self-raising flour., Buttor, Currants, Mixed spice, Granulated sugar, 
Also known as bakestones.    Rub the fat and flour together until crumbly and then add all the other  ingredients except the eggs and milk. Mix thoroughly, and then add the  eggs. Add the milk slowly while mixing, to get the right consistency. The  mix should not be too sticky as it is difficult to roll.  Roll out - not too thin, a bit less than a quarter of an inch - and cut  into rounds about 2" across. Cook on a griddle or hot plate and turn once  when brown. Dust with a little caster sugar to serve.    http://www.grossi.co.uk/wales/recipe.htm  Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 17, 1998
