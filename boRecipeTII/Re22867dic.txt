Apricot-Orange Conserve
Walnuts, Orange, peel of, finely, Chopped, dried apricots, Lemon juice, Sugar, Orange juice, 
Heres a couple of conserve recipes (untried), that I found in a little  Dell book my Mom had, dated 1975.    Cook dried apricots uncovered in a quart of water for about 20 minutes, or  until tender. Drain and chop. Combine all ingredients in kettle, except for  nuts. Stir over medium heat until thickened. remove from heat, stir in  nuts. Ladle into hot jars and seal.
