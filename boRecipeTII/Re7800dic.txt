Hi, everyone. I made this a couple of weeks ago and ate it several times. I  loved it more every time I had it. It is something I made up, therefore it  is *very* flexible. Each time I ate it, I used different fixings,  although it struck me as a great sandwich replacement. Once on a english  muffin with lettuce and tomato, once in a pita with tomato, cucumber and  onion, once with pasta & veggies and once by itself with a giant salad.    marinade was approximate, but I am pretty sure this was it:    I used this as my base and then continued to add whatever seemed savory and  good in this, a little more vinegar, and litle more juice & spices. Also, I  added water to thin it. I let the mushrooms and the tempeh marinade in this  mixture for a day and continued to let it marinade for the rest of the  week. Then, I would put a sandwich sized portion in a non-stick pan and  heat it until everything gets warm and the mushrooms and tempeh brown. Even  SAD boyfriend liked it. The great part is that it is really flexible. Hope  it is helpful!    Posted to fatfree digest by Jennifer Heineman <JHEINEMAN@PILLSBURY.COM> on  Apr 4, 1998
