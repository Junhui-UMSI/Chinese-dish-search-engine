Makes 1 Large or 2 Small Loaves    Now that youve got some basic bread making experience, its time for a few  ethnic varieties of bread recipes as served up by The Cook and Kitchen  Staff from "Our Daily Bread" collection.    Todays recipe makes for a simple, crusty Italian-style loaf bread and is  so easy to prepare, youll wonder why you ever went to an Italian  restaurant just for the bread.    In a small mixing bowl, combine warm water, yeast, and brown sugar, and let  proof for 3 to 5 minutes.    In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour and salt. Add olive oil, 1 egg,  and yeast mixture, and blend until a silky dough is formed.    Form 1 large loaf, or divide dough into 2 parts and form into long loaves.  Sprinkle cornmeal on a lightly greased baking sheet. Place loaves on the  baking sheet, seam sides down. Brush tops of the loaves with a tablespoon  of water mixed with the remaining egg. Let rise until doubled, about 50  minutes.    Pre-heat oven to 375-F degrees. Brush loaf with remaining egg wash.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Make 4 cuts about 1/4 inch deep across top of  loaf. Place a pan of hot water in bottom of oven. Bake the bread for 25 to  30 minutes or until golden. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. After  cooling, store in air-tight container to preserve. May freeze for up to 3  months.    Kitchen Staff Tip: To serve a crustier bread, five minutes before dinner is  served, re-heat the baked bread in the same temperature oven for 5 minutes.  Youll be pleasantly surprised how the extra crunch from re-heating lends  to the authenticity of the Italian bread.
