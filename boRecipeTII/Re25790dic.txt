Wrap  tortilla stack in foil and heat until warmed through, 10 to 15 minutes.    2. Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, cook onion in oil over medium-high  heat until softened but not browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and  jalapeno peppers and cook until garlic is just fragrant, about 30 seconds.    3. Spread about 1-1/2 tablespoons bean mixture on each tortilla half and  roll up jelly-roll fashion. Arrange on a serving plate and sprinkle with  cilantro. Serve warm with sour cream and salsa.    COMMENTS: If you love spicy foods, youll find these irresistible.  Theyre  also a bit messy to eat, so be sure to provide lots of napkins.
