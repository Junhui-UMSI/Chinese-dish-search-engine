This loaf is best if you wait for a day before serving it.    In a bowl, beat the egg, add the cherries, and stir in the sugar and melted  butter.  Pour in the cherry and orange juices and water. Sift the dry  ingredients together, then add them to the liquid mixture a spoonful at a  time, blending thoroughly.  Stir in the chopped nuts. Pour the batter into  a medium loaf pan. Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 1-1/4 hours, or until  a wooden toothpick inserted in the loaf comes out clean and dry. Let the  bread rest for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. Makes 1  loaf.    Origin:  Hearth and Home Companion Shared by: Sharon Stevens.
