This is a true story.  The other night, feeling a little adventurous, I  made a soup from the "WHAT TO EAT WHEN YOUR EXPECTING" book. It was called  Pumkin-Pear-Cheddar Soup.    1.  Saute onion until transparent.  Add pears and saute for 2 min.    2.  Add juice and pumpkin and blend together.  (Emulsify might be a better  word)    3.  After five minutes (soup is warmed by now) add cheese and stir, so that  cheese is melted.  (Dont use a whisk if you do try this recipe.  Im still  trying to get the cheese off of mine 3 days later after soaking.)  Add salt  and pepper to taste.    4.  Serve immediately.    Like I said before, do not attempt this recipe unless your taste buds are  suicidal.  It was the worst thing Ive ever tasted or smelled even.
