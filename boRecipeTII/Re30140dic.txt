Sift dry ingredients together. Melt butter and golden syrup together.  Let  cool. Beat egg into milk, and stir into the butter-golden syrup mixture.

The mixture should be rather lumpy, not stirred till it was smooth (or else  the Muffins Will Crack apparently.)  2/3 fill muffin pans and bake at 180  C/350 F for 15 minutes.
