Beat together  the sugar, eggs and butter until light and creamy.  Now beat the pumpkin  into this mixture until thoroughly blended. Add the oat flour to the flour  and spice mixture and add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture in three  additions, alternating with additions of cream.  Stir in the vanilla and  pour the batter into a greased loaf pan and bake at 350 F for 1 hour or til  bread is done.    notes: If you want a bread that isnt so moist, you may want to reduce the  amount of cream or slightly increase the amount of flour.  I sometimes  replace some of the cream in the recipe with kalhua, rum or brandy; and you  may want to fold some chopped nuts or dates into the batter at the last  minute.
