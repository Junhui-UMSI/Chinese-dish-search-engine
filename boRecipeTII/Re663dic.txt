Golabki - Stuffed Cabbage Leaves
Cabbage, Uncooked rice, Ground beef, Ground pork, Onion, Egg, salt and pepper, bacon, Onion, Tomato sauce, Bay leaf, 
A surprise hit with our kids who love this dish. One thing that has always  puzzled me is the Polish language - how they get "Go-wom-ki" out of the  above, Ill never figure out!    Remove core from cabbage. Scald in boiling salted water. Remove leaves one  at a time, reserving. Cook rice in boiling water for 10 minutes, the drain.  Mix together beef, pork, 1st onion, rice, egg and salt & pepper. Place a  spoonful of meat mixture on each cabbage leaf, then fold & roll.    For tomato sauce, brown bacon & chop. Add onion and saute briefly. Add  tomato sauce, bay leaf, and simmer for a minute or two.    Chop remaining cabbage and put in bottom of roasting pan, then place  cabbage rolls on top, and cover with prepared tomato sauce. Roast covered  in a 350 oven for 1 hour. Serve. Note, leftovers freeze well.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by AJScott22@aol.com on Aug 25, 1998,
