To Make the Dough:    1. Mix all the ingredients and knead thoroughly. Let rest on the counter  under a bowl for 20 Min.    To Make the Potstickers:    1. Break off about a teaspoon of the dough, and roll into a 3 inch circle.    2. Place a teaspoon of the filling in the middle of the circle, and wet the  edges of the circle with a little water. Seal into a half-moon shape,  avoiding trapped air.    3. Heat a saute pan with 2 tbs. peanut oil, and place the dumplings upright  in the pan and cook on medium /high heat until bottoms become nicely  browned (3-5 min.)    4. Pour 1 cup chicken stock into the hot pan and immediately cover. Cook  another 3 or 4 minutes, until most of the broth is absorbed.    5. Serve immediately with a sauce made with 1/2 cup soy with a dash of  ginger, scallion and a few drops of sesame oil for dipping.    Notes: You can substitue margarine or butter for the lard if you wish.
