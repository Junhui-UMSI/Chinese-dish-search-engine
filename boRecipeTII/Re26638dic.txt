Someone on r.f.v.c requested a recipe for Baigan Bharta yesterday; here is  one from Yamuna Devis "The Best of Lord Krishnas Cuisine", slightly  tweaked, that I make a lot.  (also posted on r.f.v.c.)    Bake the eggplant 40 minutes at 425F on a baking sheet. Split it and scoop  out the pulp; discard the skin.  (Some people roast the eggplant over  charcoal for a nice flavor).    Heat the ghee on medium; add cumin seeds, serranos, and asafetida. Cook  until the cumin seeds darken.  Add the eggplant, salt, and corriander; cook  for about 10 minutes, stirring occassionally. When it thickens, remove from  the heat, add the yogurt, cilantro, and garam masala, and serve. (The  yogurt might curdle; to prevent that, let the eggplant cool first, then add  the yogurt etc, then briefly reheat.)
