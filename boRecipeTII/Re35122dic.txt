Beets can be messy, so grate them last (and dont  wear a white shirt!). In a large stockpot, saute the onion in margarine for  a few minutes, then add the caraway and the rest of the vegetables. Add the  stock and the remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer for 40 to 45 minutes,  testing occasionally for doneness. If you use fresh dill, add it at the  very end. Once cooked, you can puree this soup in a blender or food  processor for more delicate texture. Serve hot, garnished with a dollop of  sour cream or a sprig of dill.
