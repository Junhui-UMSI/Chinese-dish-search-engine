Basic Lean White Bread and Variation
Sugar; (1 T), Active Dry Yeast; (1 T), 1 1/2 Lb Loaf:; (1 Lb Loaf):, Salt; (1 T), Bread Flour; (2 C), Water; (3/4 C + 1 T), 
This airy, crusty, loaf is perfect sandwich bread fro tuna fish, peanut  butter or lettuce and tomato.  If you dont slice it too thick, it will  even fit into a low-calorie diet. Since this recipe has no shortening, the  bread will turn stale, after only one day, but it will still make fine  toast, especially good for a fried egg sandwich.    Variation I used: Decreased the bread flour to 2 1/2 C and added 1/2 C  yellow cornmeal. Added 2 T sesame seeds    It really made it a totally different bread.
