This lovely dish can be served year-round if you have prepared some  pur?ed pumpkin and stored it in your freezer. Otherwise, use canned. People  will be impressed with this dish on a cold January evening, as it is rich  and warming. Warming is a Colonial term for serious food!      In a frying pan, saute the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the  flour and cook until the flour and butter begin to turn a very light golden  brown. Using a whisk, add the cream and cook until a thick sauce is  obtained. Pour this sauce into a medium-sized mixing bowl and add the  remaining ingredients, except the eggs and cream of tartar. Mix well. Then  stir in the egg yolks, one at a time. A mixer is great for this.      Whip the egg whites along with the cream of tartar and gently fold into  the pumpkin mixture. Do not overmix. Place in a buttered 1-1/2 quart  souffl? dish and bake in a preheated oven at 350? for about 30 minutes, or  until the souffl? begins to expand and brown ever so slightly on top. Serve  right away.      Serve this as a vegetable course at a light dinner. It is rich enough to  stand up against anything!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
