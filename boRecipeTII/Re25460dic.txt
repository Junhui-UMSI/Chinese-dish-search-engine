Tortilla Strips
Corn tortillas, Olive oil or olive oil, Salt; optional, 
Preheat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Lightly brush both sides of the  tortillas with olive oil, or spray them lightly with olive oil spray. Cut  the tortillas in half, then cut each strip into thin strips.    Place the strips in the hot pan. Cook and stir gently for about 5 minutes,  until they are chewy-crisp. Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels.  Salt lightly, if you prefer.    Note: I make tortilla strips without any oil at all. Simply cut the  tortillas into the size and shape you like, and heat over medium heat. Do  watch them carefully as they will burn quickly once they have browned.    >From: Ellen C. <ellen@brakes.elekta.com>    Serving Ideas : Serve with Tortilla Soup or any tomato or bean soup.
