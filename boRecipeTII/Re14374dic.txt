Recipe by: Southern Living Preparation Time: 0:45 Dissolve yeast in warm  water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add honey, stirring well. Stir  in 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1-1/2 teaspoons salt; mix well. Gradually  stir in enough all-purpose flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out onto  a heavily floured surface (dough will be sticky), and knead until smooth  and elastic (8 to 10 minutes). Place dough in a well-greased bowl, turning  to grease top. Cover dough, and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free  from drafts, 1-1/2 hours or until doubled in bulk.    Punch dough down, and divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each into a  smooth ball.  Cut with 1-inch cutter or punch a hole in the center of each  ball with a floured finger. Gently pull dough away from center to make a 1-  to 1-1/2-inch hole. Place shaped bagels on lightly greased baking sheets.  Cover and let rise 15 minutes.  Broil bagels 5 inches from heat 2 minutes  on each side or until lightly browned. Bring water and 1 teaspoon salt to a  boil in a large Dutch oven. Reduce heat, and simmer bagels 3 minutes on  each side. Place bagels on lightly greased baking sheets. Sprinkle with  sesame seeds; lightly press seeds into bagels. Bake at 425 degrees for 20  to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Yield: 1 dozen.
