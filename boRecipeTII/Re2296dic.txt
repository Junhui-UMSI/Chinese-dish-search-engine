1. Heat the gee and mix the saffron powder or coloring with milk.    2. Heat the oil and quickly seal the chicken cubes by turning frequently  for 2 minutes, then add the yellow milk and stir-fry for 2 minutes.    3. Add the garlic and stir-fry for 1 minute, then add onion and stir-fry  for 3 minutes - enough to remove the moisture content. Now add the garam  masala and stir-fry for 2 more minutes. Your total frying time is around 10  minutes, and the chicken is half cooked.    4. Add the yoghurt, cream and ground almonds and when it starts to simmer  turn the heat down and stir-fry for 10 minutes more to ensure it does not  stick, adding milk or water as necessary.    5. Place saffron strands in a little warm water and extract as much color  as you can by gently mashing with a teaspoon.    6. Check that the chicken is cooked right through by cutting a large piece  across. Simmer on if required. Just prior to serving add the saffron and  salt to taste. Garnish with the coriander and almonds, and serve  immediatley.
