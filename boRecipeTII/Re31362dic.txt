Bara Brith (Currant Bread)
Lard, Dried fruit, Salt, Fresh yeast, Warm water, Mixed spice, Candied peel, Demerara sugar, Plain flour, Eggs, 
Oven: 450F, Gas Mark 8 for 15 minutes: 375F, Gas Mark 5 for 45 minutes.  Soak the fruit and candied peel in the water with the spice.  Leave to  steep in a warm place and use the warm spicy, strained water to mix the  dough. Sift the flour and salt and rub in the lard; cream the yeast with  the sugar and a little of the spiced water; mix this into the flour,  together with the eggs and use enough of the water to give a firm, yet  elastic dough. Knead well, leave to rise and knock back; blend in the  drained fruit and knead again. Shape the dough into loaves and set into  greased 1 lb tins in a warm place to prove; bake, reducing the temperature  after the first 15 minutes. Originally, in some recipies, the fruit content  would have been fresh currants or blackberries. Bara Brith is often served  as part of the traditional Welsh tea.  It can also be purchased at many of  the small bakeries found throughout Wales. British Cookery (BTA/BFPC)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
