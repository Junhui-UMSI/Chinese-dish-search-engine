Japanese Persimmon (Diospyros Kaki)
SEE DIRECTIONS, 
The several varieties of trees that bear the edible persimmon fruit are  members of the EBONY family, Ebenaceae. The Japanese persimmon, or kaki,  Diospyros kaki, native to China and Japan, is the most important  commercially.   The black sapote, D. digyna, native to tropical Mexico and  Central America, was important in the pre-Columbian diet there.      One U.S. species, the common persimmon, D. virginiana, which grows from  Connecticut to Florida and west to Kansas, bears fruit that is edible when  fully mature. Another, the Texas persimmon, D. texana, bears inedible  fruit. Persimmons are also grown as ornamentals or for their wood. [R. J.  Knight, Jr; Grolier Encyclopedia]      SEASON: October through December.    LOOK FOR: Slightly firm, plump fruit with smooth, unbroken skin and the  stem cap attached. Avoid bruised or too soft fruit. Oriental varieties are  most common; smaller native persimmons are usually home grown. (See Wild  Persimmons)    TO STORE: When ripe, refrigerate persimmons and use them within 1 to 2  days.    TO PREPARE: Remove the caps. Press native persimmons through a food mill or  strainer to remove the seeds and skin before using the fruit in recipes.  For dessert or a snack, place an Oriental persimmon, stem end down, on a  plate; cut gashes through the top skin so that the pulp can be eaten with a  spoon.
