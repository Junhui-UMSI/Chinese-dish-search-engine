Top each cutlet with finger of cheese and roll up, tucking ends under.  Combine bread crumbs, cheese, garlic salt, pepper and remaining oregano.  Dip rolled cutlets in melted butter and then in combined bread crumbs.  Place seam side down, without sides touching, in a shallow baking dish.  Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Bake, uncovered at 400 for  20 minutes or until turkey is done. Variation: Add whole green chil (seeds  removed) along with finger of cheese. Pass the spicy tomato sauce, a  combination of a can (15 ounce) tomato sauce, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/3 cup  chopped green onion, and salt, pepper and tabasco sauce to taste.
