Turkey Tasso
Black Pepper, Liquid smoke, Ground cumin, Ground red pepper, Granulated garlic, Paprika, Salt, Sugar, Ground white pepper, Onion powder, Skinned & boned turkey brea, 
In a small bowl, combine the sugar, garlic, onion powder, red, white, and  black peppers, paprika, salt and cumin, mixing well. Place the turkey  breast in a large glass bowl and sprinkle with 4 Tbsp of the mixture,  coating well.  (store the remainder of the seasoning mix the a tight  container for future use)    Sprinkle the turkey with the liquid smoke, rubbing the seasoning mix and  liquid over the entire breast. Cover the bowl and marinate for two(2) days  in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.    Light the fire in a charcoal water smoker, cover, and let the heat and  smoke accumulate.  When the smoker is ready, place the turkey breast on the  wire rack and smoke for 7 hours. Add water as needed. Add a few mesquite  chips every hour or so.  When the tasso is done, remove and set aside until  cool enough to handle. You will note it is very dry, almost like jerky.  Dont worry, thats normal.  Store it in freezer bags up to one month in  the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.    note: This is not something you will really want to make a sandwich from.  It is used primarily in gumbo, red beans, stuffings and some pasta dishes.   It has a very pronounced flavor.  Basically, it can be used in place of  smoked ham hocks or the like.  I like it by itself, but then Ive been  accused of having no taste buds left in my mouth because of the hot food I  love to consume.
