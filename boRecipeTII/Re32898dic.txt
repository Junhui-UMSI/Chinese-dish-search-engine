I just read this recipe in the El Paso Chile Company cookbook:    In a 5-quart soup pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the leeks,  onions, paprika, cumin, basil, and bay leaves; cover and cook, stirring  occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the sweet peppers; cover and cook,  stirring occasionally for 10 minutes. Add the broth and salt and bring to a  simmer. Partially cover the pay, until the peppers are very tender, about       35    minutes.    Cool slightly, then force the soup through the medium blade of a soup mill  (the soup can be prepared up to this point up to three days ahead and can  be served hot or cold. Cool completely, cover, and refrigerate.) Rewarm the  soup over low heat if you are serving it hot. Adjust seasoning. Ladle the  soup into bowls. Sprinkle the croutons over the soup and serve immediately.    Jalapeno Croutons: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter in  the olive oil. Add the garlic cloves and jalapenos and cook, stirring often  without browning, for 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the garlic  and chiles and discard. Add the bread cubes to the skillet, tossing to coat  them evenly with the oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cubes are  lightly but evenly browned, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and use warm.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest 10 Jan 97    From:    Gretl Collins <gretl_collins@AGCS.CAS.PSU.EDU>    Date:    Fri, 10 Jan 1997 16:57:30 -0500
