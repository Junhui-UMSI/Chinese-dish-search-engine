Pecan Pie (Julie's)
Pecans; coarsely chopped, Vanilla, Egg, Pie shell; unbaked, Butter, Sugar, Dark corn syrup, 
Flute unbaked pie shell in 9-inch pie pan.  Allow butter to stand at room  temperature until extremely soft.  Add sugar, corn syrup, salt and vanilla;  beat until thoroughly blended.  Add eggs and beat until just blended. Fold  in pecans.  Pour into pie shell.  Bake at 375 just below center of oven  until top is toasted brown and filling is set - about 40-50 minutes. Pastry  edge should be browned.  If top of pie gets very brown toward end of baking  time, place a tent of foil over it.  Cool on wire rack. Serve with  unsweetened whipped cream.
