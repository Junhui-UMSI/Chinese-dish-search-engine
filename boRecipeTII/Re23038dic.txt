Rinse the trout inside and out in cold water and pat dry. Using a pair of  kitchen shears, cut off the fins.   Put the trout in a dish and add the milk.  Turn the fish to coat with the  liquid.   Remove each trout and dredge in flour seasoned with salt and pepper to  taste. Shake to remove excess.   Heat the oil in a skillet and add the trout.  Cook over moderately high  heat about 4 to 5 minutes or until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook  until golden brown on the other side. Let cook until the trout are cooked  throughout.  As the fish cook, baste with the oi in the skilet. The total  cooking time is about 10-15 minutes.   Transfer the fish to a warm serving dish.  Sprinkle with the cubed lemon.   Pour off the fat from the skillet and wipe it out. Heat the butter until  it starts to brown.  Add the capers. Cook about 15 seconds and pour the  butter sauce over the fish.
