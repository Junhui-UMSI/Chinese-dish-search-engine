Sift 1 cup flour and 1 teaspoon paprika into a bowl. Beat 1 egg yolk into 1  cup of ice-cold water and the quickly blend into the flour. Small lumps may  be there, but thats okay. Its better not to over mix. Coat 2 or 3 onion  strips at a time and drop into 2 inches of hot oil. Separate with a fork.  Fry 1-2 minutes or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and keep warm  until ready to serve. Sprinkle with lots of salt and pepper.
