Recipe by: St. Louis Post-Dispatch 10/2/95 For double top loin roast, if  roast is tied, cut strings and open 2 pieces like book. Sprinkle with salt  and pepper and half of the thyme and rosemary. Arrange 3/4 of apple slices  evenly down center of roast. Arrange prunes in 1 row and spread remaining  apple slices on top. Replace other section of roast to enclose filling. Tie  with heavy string every 2 inches. Sprinkle roast with remaining thyme and  rosemary. Season to taste with salt and pepper.    (For boned, rolled and tied pork loin, make tunnel for stuffing by cutting  2 1/4-inch-wide slit in center of each end of loin. With long, narrow  knife, cut through loin to connect slits, making opening about 1 1/4 inches  in diameter. Sprinkle cavity with salt, pepper and herbs. Fill pocket from  both ends with apples and prunes, spacing evenly.) Preheat oven to 350  degrees. Heat olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add pork loin and brown on all sides, about 12 minutes. Coat rack and  roasting pan with cooking spray. Place roast on rack in roasting pan. Place  potatoes in skillet and saute until brown on all sides. Add potatoes to  roasting pan. Bake until internal temperature of roast is 160 degrees for  well done, about 1 3/4 hours. Cover loosely with foil and let stand 10  minutes before slicing. Serve with roasted potatoes. Yield: 8 to 10  servings.
