Cut figs in half length=wise and remove stems.    Combine figs, vinegar and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a bowl and marinate for  20 minutes, stirring occaisionally.    Whisk together eggs and remaining sugar (by hand or in a food precessor).  Whisk in flour, milk, vanilla and salt until just combined.    Drain figs, reserving juice, and place, cut side up, in baking dish.  Combine the juice with batter and pour over figs.    Bake 30-40 minutes or until golden and puffed and a toothpick inserted in  the centre comes out clean.    Cool slightly and serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired. The  gratin will reheat well.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Nancy Berry <nlberry@prodigy.net> on Sep  20, 1998,
