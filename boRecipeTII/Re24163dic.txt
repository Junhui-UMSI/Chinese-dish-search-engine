Traditional Southern Buttermilk Biscuits
solid vegetable shortening, Salt, Buttermilk, Baking soda, Flour, Baking Powder, 
1. Preheat oven to 425F. In a large bowl, sift together flour, salt, soda,  and powder. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the shortening into  the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form.    2. Add the buttermilk, tossing with a fork until a dough forms.    3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gather into a disk. Knead  lightly a few times until smooth. (The dough may be made up to two hours  ahead, wrapped in plastic wrap, and refrigerated until ready to use.)    4. Pat the dough to 3/4 inch thick. Using a biscuit cutter or a glass  dipped in flour, cut out the biscuits. Place them, two inches apart, onto  an ungreased baking sheet. Gather dough trimmings, pat to 3/4 inch thick,  and cut out more biscuits.    5. Bake until golden brown, about 12-15 minutes. Serve hot.
