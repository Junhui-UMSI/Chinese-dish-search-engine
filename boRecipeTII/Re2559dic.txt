Peaches with Cabernet Sauvignon and Raspberries
Raspberries, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sugar, Peaches, 
Pour the wine into a stainless steel saucepan. Add the sugar and the  peaches. Bring to the boil then turn the heat down to a mild simmer. Leave  the peaches to cook slowly until they are thoroughly tender (about 20  minutes or so). Lift them out with a draining spoon and set aside in a  serving dish.    Turn the heat up and let the liquid boil until it is slightly syrupy. Taste  it for sweetness. Add more caster sugar or honey if you think it needs it.    Pour the syrup over the peaches, scatter over the raspberries and leave to  coo. Chill in the fridge, turning the peaches occasionally in their syrup.

Cream or yoghurt is tempting,       but not strictly       necessary.
