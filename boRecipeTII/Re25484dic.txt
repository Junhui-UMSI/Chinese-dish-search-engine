Tortoni #1
Almonds; chopped and toasted, Toasted coconut, Vanilla ice cream, Rum, Raisins, Cherries, 
Mix almonds and coconut. Mash ice cream a little to soften. Add raisins,  rum and a little more than 1/4 cup almond-coconut mixture. Spoon into paper  muffin cups. These will shape well if put into muffin tins and frozen  immediately. Top with remaining almond-coconut mixture and top with a  cherry.    MRS JOHN P.
