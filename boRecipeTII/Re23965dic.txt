** See recipe for Puff Pastry.    For the pastry cornets:  =======================         Roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface to 3" x  20" rectangle, 1/4" thick.  Cut the rectangle into 4 long strips, each  3/4" wide.         Wrap each strip around a long metal cone (which can be made from  heavy-duty aluminum foil), beginning at the tip and rolling the strip  around and around, overlapping slightly.  Place these on an ungreased  baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour or more.         Preheat oven to 375 F.         Bake pastry cornets until golden, about 15 minutes.         Cool briefly, then very carefully the metal or foil cones.    For the lemon dressing:  =======================         Combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.  Whisk in the oil a drop at a time.  When the dressing begins to  thicken, add the oil 1 teaspoon at a time, then continue adding oil in  a thin stream.         Adjust seasonings to taste.         Cook the asparagus, tied in bundles, in boiling salted water  until its just crisp-tender; drain.    Construction:  =============         Pour a small amount of dressing on each serving plate.         Place a cornet on top of the dressing and tuck the asparagus into  the ends of the cornet, fanning the tips outward.
