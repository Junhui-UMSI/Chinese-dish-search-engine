Add the other ingredients in turn,  stirring well.  Pluck a small piece of the paste and form into a ball the  size of a walnut.  Do not mould too tightly. Deep-fry the balls until  golden brown, drain and serve with the thick sweet sauce below.    THE SAUCE: Gently heat the three ingredients until the sugar dissolves.  Allow to cool before serving.
