Xnipec Salsa
Onion, diced, Tomato, diced, Habanero chiles, seeds and, Juice of 4 limes, 
Were having our annual "Fall Festival" here in Castro Valley, but it  looks like it doesnt hold a candle to the Austin Hot Sauce Contest.    I really got a kick out of the paper.  Austin looks like a very  interesting place.  Heres the Habanero salsa recipe.  I would  approach this with the greatest caution.  ;-}    You dont find too many recipes for Habanero chiles.  This is Pinch a  Pollo restaurants recipe for a delicious pico de gallo made with  fresh Habaneros.    Soak the diced onion in the lime juice for at least 30 minutes.  Add  all the other ingredients and mix.  Salt to taste.  Serve with  grilled fish or grilled chicken.  Caution:  Extremely hot!
