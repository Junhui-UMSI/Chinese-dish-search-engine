Poncit
Spring onion, Garlic, Soy sauce, Meat (pork), Broth, Celery, Salt, Cooking oil, Cabbage, MSG, Rice sticks, Onion, Carrot, 
Saute garlic in cooking oil.  Add onions, meat, carrot and cabbage. Season  with soy sauce and fry for 2 more minutes. Add broth and simmer, then add  celery.    When vegetables are cooked, add rice sticks or noodles and season with salt  and MSG.  Garnish with spring onions. Serve with lemon.    NOTES:    *  Filipino cabbage in garlic and soy sauce -- I got this from Lynne  Fitzsimmons who got it from a Filipino friend of her mothers.    *  You will need a big frying pan to fit all the ingredients. You may leave  out the salt and MSG if you like. I have successfully used  lightly-microwaved bacon as the meat.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  20 minutes.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Pat Caudill  : Tektronix, Inc., Portland, Oregon, USA  : patc@tekcrl.tek.com    tektronix!tekcrl.tek.com!patc    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
