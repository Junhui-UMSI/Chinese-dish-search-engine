Date: Tue, 23 Apr 1996 19:36:33 -0700 (PDT)    From: wendy@CWU.EDU  I wanted to share this recipe with you all, but warn you ahead of time that  I could eat this pie every day of the week.  For those of you who would  like to know the origin of the recipe it comes from Susan Woodruffs  "Secrets of Fat-Free Baking."    Lemon cheese Pie:    1. Combine the sugar and cornstarch in a medium-sized nonstick saucepan.  Slowly stir in the buttermilk.  Place over medium heat and cook, constantly  stirring with a wire whisk, until the mixture is thickened and bubbly.  Add  the lemon rind to the buttermilk mixture, and continue to cook and stir for  another minute or 2.    2. Reduce the heat to low, and blend about 1/2 C. of the hot mixture into  the egg substitute. Then return the egg mixture to the pan. Cook and stir  over low heat for 2 to 3 additional minutes. Do not allow the mixture to  come to a boil.    3. Remove the mixture from the heat, and stir in the lemon juice.  Pour  filling into pie crust.    4. Chill for several hours, or until filling is set (it usually takes at  least 2 hours-I have put mine in the freezer to speed up the process) Cut  into wedges and serve cold.

Break the crackers in peices, and place in the bowl of a food processor  or blender. Process into fine crumbs. Measure the crumbs.    2. Return the crumbs-approx 1-1/4cups-to the food processor, and add sugar  and prune butter. Process until moist and crumbly.    3. Coat a 9-inch pie pan (I sometimes use an 8inch-crust is just thicker  and so is pie) with cooking spray. Use back of sppon to press the crumbs  against the sides and bottom of the pan, forming an even crust. Dip spoon  into sugar if necessary to prevent sticking.    4. Back at 350F for 10 minutes or until the edges feel firm and dry.  Cool  to room temperature and the fill as desired. (This crust dries out easily  so monitor it closely while baking)    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #120    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
