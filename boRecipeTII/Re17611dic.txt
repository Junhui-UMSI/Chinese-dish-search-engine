Almond Lace
Sugar, Sliced almonds; toasted, Cold water, 
In a heavy saucepan gently combine sugar and water, avoiding getting sugar  up the walls of the pan. Boil the mixture, brushing down the sides of the  pan with cold water, if necessary, until the mixture becomes a  light-colored caramel. Dip the bottom of the saucepan into ice water to  stop the cooking. Let cool slightly until caramel falls off a spoon in a  slow stream. Spread almonds on a sheet pan. Drizzle caramel over sliced  almonds in a lacy fashion to form a flat triangle shape. Let cool. Lift off  sheet pan and store in an airtight container.
