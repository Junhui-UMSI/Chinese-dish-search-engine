1. Devein the shrimp with the shells on by running the blade of a small,  sharp scissor down the back of the shrimp through the shell & pulling the  vein out. Rinse and dry well with paper towels.    2. Heat the olive oil over high heat in a saute pan large enough to  comfortably hold all shrimp without crowding. When the oil is hot, add the  garlic and quickly stir about in the oil, taking care not to burn.    3. Immediately add the shrimp. Stir constantly. Add the oregano, a generous  pinch of salt, and a generous amount of freshly ground pepper. Be sure that  the garlic does not burn. As the shrimp turn pink,(2 to 3 min.), add the  lemon juice. Stir thoroughly. Cook only until the shrimp are pink and  resilient to the touch, no more than 3 to 4 minutes. If overcooked, shrimp  are tough.    4. Place on heated platter or individual heated serving dishes.    5. Quickly pour the vermouth into the pan, still over high heat. Let reduce  by half. Add a dash of butter and a sprinkling of black pepper. Taste for  seasoning and pour evenly over the shrimp. Garnish with fresh parsley and  lemon wedges. Note: Provide guests with large bibs or wet towels. Use  either large (16 to 20 per lb.) or medium (25 to 32 per lb.) shrimp.
