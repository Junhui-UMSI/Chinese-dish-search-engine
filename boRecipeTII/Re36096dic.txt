Beef Roulades
green pepper, Bacon, onion, Celery, Beef round steak, 
I bought the Rival Crockpot book and this recipe sounds great.  I plan to  try it tonight.  Pam Cobb    Cut steak into 4 serving pieces.  Place bacon slice on each piece of meat.  Mix celery, onion and green pepper; place about 1/2 cup mixture on each  piece of meat. Roll up meat; secure ends with wooden picks. Wipe beef rolls  with paper towels. Place in Crock-Pot. Pour gravy evenly over steaks to  thoroughly moisten.  Cover Crock-Pot and cook on Low for 8-10 hours or on  High for 4-5 hours. Skim off fat, if desired, before serving. Serves 4.
