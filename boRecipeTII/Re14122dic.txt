Add garlic & saute for 2 min. Stir in flour. Add  reserved clam juices, wine, red pepper flakes and salt. Bring to boil &  simmer for 10 min. Add minced clams, baby clams and parsley. Return to  boil, then keep warm while preparing linguine. When linguine is done, pour  sauce over top and toss gently and serve. I forget how many this will  serve. Probably at least 4.
