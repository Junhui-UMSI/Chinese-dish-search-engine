Apricot Preserves
Pitted, very ripe apricots, Sugar (7 lbs), Lemon, 
hot water    Cook apricots and sugar to setting point, continually skimming off foam.  Shortly before done, add lemon juice. Remove from heat. Stir in Preserving  Aid dissolved in hot water. Pour into hot, dry, sterilized jars. Seal jars  with cellophane the top of which has been dipped in rum and smooth the  overhang over the jars necks, tying with thin twine.    Makes 12 half-liter jars and one quarter-liter jar. (Between 13 and 14 1  pint jars).    "Einsiedehilfe" (Preserving Aid) is sold (in Austria) in 15 gram packages  and consists of 65 percent sugar and 35 percent benzoic acid.    To test for setting point:  Spoon a little of the conserve onto a chilled  saucer. Leave for a few minutes - then hold saucer upside down. If conserve  doesnt run, then setting point has been reached.    From:  Maria Baumgartner (Karin Brewers mother), Vienna, Austria Posted  by:  Karin Brewer, Cooking Echo, 6/92
