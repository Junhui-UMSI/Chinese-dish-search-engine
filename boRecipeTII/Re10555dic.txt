Quick Mead
Ground nutmeg, Jasmine tea, Ground allspice, Honey, Ground ginger, Ale yeast, Cinnamon, Ground cloves, Water, 
Boil  water, adding tea and spices. Remove from heat and stir in  honey.  (Some mead makers boil the honey, skimming the scum as it forms).  Cover  boiled water, and set aside to cool (this usually takes a long time,  so  start on the next step).  Make a yeast starter solution by boiling a cup of  water and a tablespoon or two of honey. Add starter to cooled liquid. Cover  and  ferment using blow tube or fermentation lock.  Rack  two  or three  times to get rid of sediment. The less honey, the lighter the drink, and  the quicker it can be  made. 1 pound per gallon is the minimum, 5 pounds  per gallon  is  about  the maximum for a sweet dessert wine. This mead is a  metheglin  because  of the tea. The yeast is pitched one day after starting  the batch, the crud skimmed about 10 days later, then wait 3 days and rack  to second-  ary. Wait 2 more weeks and bottle---about 4 weeks from start to  finish. Yield is 3.1 gallons. Excellent clarity, fairly sweet flavor,  slight sediment, light gold color. An excellent batch.
