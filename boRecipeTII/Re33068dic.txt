meat, Salt, Oil, Eggs, Vegetables, 
1. Follow steps 1 and 2 of "Basic Pan-Fried Egg Foo Yung". (You may, if you  wish, not beat the eggs first but stir them in with the meat and vegetables  until well mixed.)    2. Heat oil until it foams (it should be about 2-1/2 inches deep).  Carefully drop egg mixture into oil with a ladle, tipping the ladle to  release the omelets. (For a 3-inch omelet, allow 1/2 cup of egg mixture;  for a smaller one, 1/4 cup.)    3. Let omelet rise to the top (this will take about 2 minutes). Baste with  hot oil to brown. Then flip omelet over, using a spoon and spatula, or 2  spoons, and baste to brown the other side. Lift out with a slotted spoon  and drain on paper toweling. Keep warm.    4. Repeat process until egg mixture is used up. Serve omelets either plain,  sprinkled lightly with soy sauce, or with "Egg Foo Yung Sauce #1/#2").
