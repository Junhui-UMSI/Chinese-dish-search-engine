Sift the flour into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Make a well in the  centre and pour in the eggs.    Gradually add the milk and water to the well, stirring round the edge of  the well until all the flour becomes amalgamated and smooth. Then mix in  the oil and leave to stand for 2-3 hours.    When the batter has stood for this time, lightly grease and heat a  heavy-bottomed frying pan. Cook approximately 1 tbs of the mixture at a  time, spreading it over the pan. Loosen the edges of the pancakes from the  pan before tossing. Allow them to cook for 1 minute on each side.    from RECIPES FOR HEALTH - DIABETES by AZMINA GOVINDJI & JILL MEYERS pub. in  assoc. with BRITISH DIABETIC ASSOCIATION typed by KEVIN JCJD SYMONS    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Nov 08, 98
