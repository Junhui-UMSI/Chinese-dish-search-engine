Cut gashes in meat. With a larding needle, insert strips of bacon into  gashes. Tie meat with string and place in a crock or kettle. Add next 8  ingredients; cover with equal parts of red wine vinegar and water. Leave to  marinate for 24 hours. Turn over 1 or 2 times during marinating. Spoon  vegetables, seasonings and liquid into a shallow baking dish; place meat on  top of them. Roast, uncovered, in a preheated moderate oven (325F.) ,  allowing 35 to 40 mins per pound, to desired degree of doneness. When  finished cooking, remove from oven. Take meat from the pan. Keep warm.  Strain drippings and liquid. Put strained liquid into a saucepan; stir in  flour. Cook slowly, stirring with a whisk or fork, until thickened. Add  sour cream; leave on stove long enough to heat. Slice meat and serve  covered with sauce. Serves 8.    NOTES : This meat dish, commonly called Svickova, has an appealing  sweet-sour flavor.
