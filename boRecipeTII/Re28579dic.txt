submitted by: sgjg6566@pipeline.com (Julie, Michigan, USA)  Hi Everyone!! This recipe is hot and spicy!!!    Slice the steak diagonally into thin strips. Set aside. Combine the oil and  the spices. Heat half of the oil mix in a skillet or wok over high heat for  3 minutes. Add onion, and all the peppers and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes; add  broccoli and stir-fry another 3 minutes until broccoli is crisp-tender.  Remove all vegetables from the skillet and set aside. Add the rest of the  oil mixture to the wok or skillet and add the beef strips. Stir fry 2-3  minutes or til steak is browned. Return the vegetables to skillet or wok  and stir fry til heated through. Serve over rice.
