Set in the refrigerator to  chill for at least 2 hours.  Then beat until mixture is so thick it holds  its shape and will stand in peaks. This makes enough frosting for top,  sides and between layers of 3 layer cake, even when you use a generous  hand.  Note: Pop cake in refrigerator after frosting to allow to set. Store  cake in refrigerator so frosting will not spoil.    NOTES : I found this recipes to be enough to frost a 3 layer cake, but only  a thin coating.  As this is a decadant recipe, I double it and frost the  cake with about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of frosting between layers.... you still  have enough to frost top and sides with about a 1/4 inch layer. It looks  very professional this way and I always get rave reviews at work when Ive  brought in a dark chocolate cake with this frosting.    EAT-L Digest  6 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.
