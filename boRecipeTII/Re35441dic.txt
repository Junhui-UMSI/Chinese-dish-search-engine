Remove fat,muscle & any gristle from meat. Cut in 1/2 lengthwise. Slice  each piece crosswise, against the grain & on a slight slant, so you have  1/4-in. slices. Place in bowl & marinate for 1 hr. in soy sauce, sherry,  egg, salt, pepper & cornstarch. Heat a wok hot & dry. Add oil. When its  just beginning to smoke,add meat mixture, stirring it quickly so the pieces  separate. After 1 min.,drain through a colander or sieve, reserving 2-3  tbs. oil. Prepare the Imperial Sauce. Return reserved oil to the wok. Add  mushrooms, bamboo shoots, ginger, garlic, snow peas & meat. Move wok back &  forth rapidly in the air so the vegetables are flipped into the air  continuously. Add Imperial Sauce & continue flipping vegetables & meat 3  min. or until the sauce thickens. If desired,sprinkle a few drops of sesame  oil on mixture. Serve. Dont mistake Oriental for American sesame oil. They  are totally different.    MINGS    YORK ROAD; BALTIMORE    WINE:WAN-FU    From the <Micro Cookbook Collection of Chinese Recipes>.
