pork rip, Butter or margarine, All-purpose flour, Salt, Pepper, Chicken broth, Cooking oil, salt and pepper, Potatoes, Onion, Paprika, 
In a saucepan, melt butter; stir in flour, salt and pepper. Add chicken  broth; cook and stir constantly until mixture boils. Cook for 1 minute;  remove from the heat and set aside.    In a skillet, brown pork chops in oil; season to taste with additional salt  and pepper if desired. In a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish, layer potatoes and onion. Pour the broth mixture over. Place pork chops on  top. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour; uncover and bake 30 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender. You may add the pork chops to the potatoes later on in the baking process, to ensure a perfectly cooked chop (internal temp 145 degrees). The chops may be done in as little as 30 minutes. If desired, sprinkle with paprika and  parsley.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #224    Date: Wed, 25 Sep 1996 16:20:56 -0700    From: Gerald Edgerton <jerrye@wizard.com>
