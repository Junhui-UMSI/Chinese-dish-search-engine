Pineapple Glazed Yams
Orange rind, Brown sugar, Salt, Pineapple, Yams, Margarine, non-dairy, Cornstarch, 
Peel the yams, slice them thickly, and boil them in salted water for about  10 minutes. Melt the margarine in a large, heavy skillet and stir in the  brown sugar, salt, orange rind and pineapple.     Dissolve the cornstarch in about 2 Tbs of cold water and stir it into the  pineapple mixture. When the mixture is well blended and thickened, add the  yams and turn them over until all the slices are coated evenly. Continue  cooking over a medium flame until the yams are quite tender and  well-glazed. Serve hot.   Serves 6.     Recipe by Susan D.
