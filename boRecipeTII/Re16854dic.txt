All-Chocolate Blackout Cake Pt 2
See part 1, 
Serves 8 to 10    Note: Please note that these ingredients make a very runny filling that  pleased the 12 devout Ebingerists who taste-tested different versions of  this cake. Those who desire a less syrupy consistency can stir in an  additional 1 to 2 tablespoons cornstarch.    Recipe is from _New York Cookbook_ by Molly ONeill.
