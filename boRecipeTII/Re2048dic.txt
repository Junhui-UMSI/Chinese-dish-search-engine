Almond Lace Cookies
Butter, Flour, almonds, Sugar, Unsalted butter, All-purpose flour, milk, orange zest, 
* Note: In a food processor, grind the almonds to a powder by pulsing off  and on to keep the powder loose.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter and flour at least 2 baking  sheets.    In a large saute pan, combine the remaining ingredients. Stir over low heat  with a wooden spoon until the butter melts and the ingredients are well  mixed. Remove from the heat.    Place heaping teaspoons of the batter about 5 inches apart. (The batter  will spread during baking.) Bake for 8 to 10 minutes or until evenly  browned. Remove from the oven. Using a wide spatula, remove the cookies  from the baking sheet and immediately shape as desired, into tightly rolled  cigarettes, or fans, or allow to cool and serve flat.    Store in airtight containers for 2 days or in the freezer for up to a  month.   This recipe yields 16 to 20 cookies.
