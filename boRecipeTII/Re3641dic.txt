Heres one I got from a friend many years ago...  I havent tried it  for a long time, but it was excellent++good enough for me to get the  recipe and I wasnt even into cooking at the time.    Fry the bacon and save 3 tablespoons of the drippings.  Fry onion and  celery in the drippings until tender.  Blend in flour, stirring until  bubbly.  Remove from heat and stir in milk.  Heat to boiling point,  stirring constantly.  Boil and stir for one minute.  Stir in remaining  ingredients.    If you feel really racy, dump in a drained can of clams.
