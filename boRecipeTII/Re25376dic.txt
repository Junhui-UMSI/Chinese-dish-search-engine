Even more so if you include blossoms from the       squash and some nasturtium flowers.  If using, slice blossoms       thinly crosswise. Add the blossoms to the skillet when you add the       vegetable broth.  Here are some stuffing ideas for the tortillini:       walnuts, cheese, carrot, spinach, herb, pesto; alone or in       combination.
