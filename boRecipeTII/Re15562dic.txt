7-Mile Red Ale
Fuggles hop plugs, l crystal malt, Cascades whole leaf hops, Glen-brew ale yeast, Northwestern amber malt extr, 
Recipe by: Karl Lutzen Preparation Time: 4:00 Steep crystal malt for 30  minutes in 150 degree water. Sparge into  brew pot of hot water and add  malt extract. Bring to boil and add  1  ounce Fuggles. 20 minutes later add  another ounce. At the 40 minute mark, toss in the final half ounce of  fuggles. (Almost threw in a full ounce,  but after tasting wort, decided  against it---plenty bitter at this  point.) Turn off heat and add Cascades.  Stirred down the hops slowly and let sit for about 10 minutes. Strain all  into fermenter containing  ice  water. Cooled. Pitched yeast. Single stage  ferment. Keg, and age a few days. I came up with the name when helping  install a phone system  and  after the job was done, I had pulled over  seven miles of  phone  line...ugh! Its a good ale, but not the "Great Ale"  that  Im  still  looking for...maybe its in the fermenter now? Original  Gravity: 1.044 Final Gravity: 1.010 Primary Ferment: 10 days    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
