Ketchup, Egg, Brown sugar; to taste, Garlic, Ginger OR 6 Ginger Snaps, Tomatoes, Onion; grated, Cabbage, Lemon juice; to taste, Tomato sauce, Ground beef, Water, Salt & pepper; to taste, Onion; sliced, 
Core the cabbage and boil in salted water to cover for 10 min., until the  leaves separate easily. Drain well and separate into individual leaves.    Mix the ground beef, grated onion, egg, garlic, salt & pepper together for  the filling. Water might be needed to bind the meat.    Put a tablespoon of meat inside a cabbage leaf and roll up.    Place the sliced onion in the bottom of a heavy pot. Put the cabbage rolls  with the sealed edge down on the onions.    Mix together the tomatoes, tomato sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, lemon juice  and ginger snaps; and pour into the pot.    Make sure there is a nice gingery flavor, not too sweet.    Simmer with the cover ajar for 2 hours. Taste often and adjust seasonings.
