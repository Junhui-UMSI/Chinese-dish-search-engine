Asparagus, Poached Egg and Pine-Nut Salad
Pine nuts, Eggs; poached, Medium-thick asparagus, Salt and pepper, Balsamic or sherry vinegar, olive oil, Handful rocket, Parma ham, Parmesan cheese; thinly, Dressing:, 
Trim off the woody ends of the asparagus. Cut off the top inch of the  stalks and cut the rest into inch length. Drop the shorter bits into salted  boiling water, simmer for two minutes, then add the tips. Cook for a  further 2/3 minutes, then drain, run under the cold tap, and drain again  thoroughly.   Dry-fry the pine nuts in a heavy pan over a high heat. Whisk  the oil into the vinegar and season.    Just before serving, poach the eggs. Toss the rocket and asparagus in just  enough of the dressing to coat evenly. Arrange on two plates. Drape a slice  of parma ham over each, scatter with pine nuts, nestle a poached egg on top  and strew with flakes of parmesan.
