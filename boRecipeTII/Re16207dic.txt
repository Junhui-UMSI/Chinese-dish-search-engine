Wassail Mead
Wine yeast, Acid blend, Light clover honey, Yeast nutrient, 
Add honey, acid blend, and yeast nutrient to 2 gallons of water and boil  for  1/2  hour. Add this to 1-1/2 gallons of cold water in  the  primary  fermenter. Pitch yeast when the temperature reaches 70-75 degrees. Use a  blow  off tube if you use a carboy. Allow fermentation to proceed for  3  weeks  or  more  (up to several months). When the  mead  becomes  fairly  clear,  rack  to secondary.  Attach air-lock. Leave the mead to  sit  at  least 3 weeks. When yeast settles to bottom and is clear, it is ready to  bottle.  Adding 3/4 cup of corn sugar at bottling will produce a sparkl-  ing  mead. Sparkling meads should not be made with an  original  gravity  higher than 1.090.
