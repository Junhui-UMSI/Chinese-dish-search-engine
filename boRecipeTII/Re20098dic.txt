Vanilla Glazed Acorn Squash
Sprigs Fresh Thyme, Lowfat Margarine, Acorn Squash, Abt 14 Oz Each, Vanilla extract, Ground Red Pepper, For, Nonfat Vegetarian Broth,, 
Preheat oven to 375 deg F. Spray shallow baking dish with nonstick cooking  spray.    Halve squash lengthwise; scoop out and discard seeds and pulp. Arrange  squash cut-side up in prepared baking dish.    I adjusted the original recipe a bit...changed the regular margarine to low  fat and low sodium broth to nonfat vegetarian chicken flavored broth.    In small bowl, combine broth and vanilla.    Place 1/2 tsp low fat margarine in each hollowed-out center. Add 1/4 C of  the broth mixture, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 thyme sprig to each. Add enough  water to baking pan to fill it to 1/2". Bake until tender, about 1 1/2 hrs,  brushing cut edges of squash every 30 minutes with some of the broth  mixture in the center and adding water to the pan as necessary. Sprinkle  with pepper.    This was very, very good.
