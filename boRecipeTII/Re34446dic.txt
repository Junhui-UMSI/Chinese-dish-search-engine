I have a wunnnderrrfulll bean dip from my mother in law in Michigan.....    In large saucepan combine all ingredients. Heat stirring frequently, til  cheese is melted and beans are heated through. Can serve at room temp or  warm. Makes 1 1/4 cup dip. This can be frozen, but there is never any left  to freeze at my house. Serve with assorted tortilla chips.
