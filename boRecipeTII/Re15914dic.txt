Heat the olive oil in a pan, add garlic and onions and saute over medium  heat until translucent. Take out the garlic and add the tomatoes, salt,  pepper and herbs of choice. Cook over high heat until the mixture is hot  and all the flavors have combined.    Cover with cold water -- 3 times the amount of the other ingredients --  then reduce the heat to low. Cook partially covered at least one hour --  the longer the better.    At the last minute, soak the chunks of bread in the soup and serve hot.
