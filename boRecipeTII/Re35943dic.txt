To prepare spaghetti sauce, saute mushrooms, onions, peppers, and garlic  until tender. Then, add meat and cook until no pink remains. Drain. Stir in  undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano, basil, and pepper. Bring  to a boil; reduce heat. Cover; and simmer for 30 minutes. Then, set aside.  Preheat oven at 350. To prepare stuffing, bring water to a boil in a large  pot and add shells. Return to a boil, then continue cooking for 5 to 6  minutes more, or until shells are barely tender. Drain and set aside on  flat baking sheet (to prevent sticking). In a mixing bowl, combine cottage  cheese, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg whites, parsley,  salt, and pepper. Pour 1 cup of spaghetti sauce onto bottom of a 13 x 9 x  2" pan. Fill each shell generously with cheese mixture, about 1 tablespoon  in each shell. Place filled shells in pan. Pour remaining spaghetti sauce  over each shell, then top with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake for 45  minutes or until golden.
