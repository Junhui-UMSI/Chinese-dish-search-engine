Tunnel of Fudge
Walnuts or pecans, Double dutch frosting mix, Butter, Flour, Eggs, 
In large bowl, cream butter.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after  each addition.  Gradually add sugar; beat at high speed until light and  fluffy.  By nad, stir in flour, dry frosting mix, and wlanuts until well  blended.  Bake in greased and floured 12 cup bundt pan at 350 degrees F for  60 to 65 minutes. Since the cake has the soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary  doneness tests can not be used.  Test after 60 minutes by observing a dry,  shiny brownie-type crust.  Cool 30 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack or  serving plate. Cake will have a moist center called the Tunnel of Fudge.
