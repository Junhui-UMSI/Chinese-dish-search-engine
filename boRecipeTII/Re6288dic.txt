Plain Old Fashioned White Bread
-water, Sugar;  (if you have trouble, Salt, Powdered milk, Bread flour; (I use 1/2 cup, Margarine; or olive oil, Powdered yeast, 
When the ABM starts look inside and watch the dough it should be just one  big ball that is fairly soft, if its sticky and gooshy you have to add more  flour. If there is still flour laying around and its as hard as a brick you  have to add water. You have to do this with just about every NEW recipe  until you get the right combination for your machine, flour, and climate.    First thing you need to do is get some bread flour (there is a difference)  and get some yeast in bulk. Do not use the little packages they are just to  expensive. Most of the big warehouse clubs carry yeast in bigger packages.    If this dont work get back to us and tell us what is going on.
