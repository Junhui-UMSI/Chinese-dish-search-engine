The aroma of charcoal broiling squid to perfection attracts customers to  the street stalls of many of the cities and small towns in the southern  region of Thailand.  The flavor would be enhanced by any number of dipping  sauces.  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------  Cut open the squid and remove the entrails, leaving the tentacles intact.  Remove the skin.    Place on a rack and charcoal-broil for 2 minutes on each side.  Brush with  the combined fish sauce and soy sauce during broiling to add color and more  flavor.    Mix together the sauce ingredients and pour into a bowl.  Cut the cooked  squid into 1 inch pieces and serve with the dipping sauce.    From: Thailand The Beautiful Cookbook.  Typed by Syd Bigger.
