Instant Cappuchino Recipe
Instant Coffee Creamer, Instant Chocolate Drink Mix, Instant Coffee Crystals, Sugar (adjust to taste), Ground cinnamon, Ground nutmeg, 
If you have tried the commercial instant cappuchino mixes you may be as  disappointed as me in their lack of coffee flavor and their excess of  sugar. I have come upon the following recipe that is tasty and much more  coffee like than the commercial instants.  It is also not as sweet!  Naturally it is not as good as fresh made but it is an good substitute for  the next time you go camping without the espresso maker.    Combine all of the ingredients and mix well.  Use about 3 tablespoons or 4  teaspoons per 6 oz cup of boiling water.    From: Paul Dibiase    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Oct 07, 98
