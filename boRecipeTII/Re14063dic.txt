Almond Cookie Shell:  ====================         Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat them briefly.         Add the sugar and flour, then whisk.  Stir in the almonds.         Butter a sheet pan and spoon tablespoons of mixture onto the pan.  Spread the spoonfuls on the sheet slightly with the back of a spoon to  form circles about 2 inches apart.         Bake in a 350 F oven for 5 - 7 minutes.  Remove from oven and while  still hot, mold into small cups by placing over a rolling pin.  Set aside  to dry.    Mousse:  =======         In a saucepan, heat the sugar and water until the mixture forms a soft  ball.         Put the egg whites in the bowl of a mixer, and beat them until medium  stiff (beating first on medium, then on high).         Add the sugar and water (soft ball stage) from the saucepan to the egg  whites and continue to beat briefly until a stiff meringue is formed.         Place the egg yolks in a metal bowl and beat them over heat with a  whisk.  Add rum to the egg yolks - still beating over heat.  Fold the egg  yolks into the egg whites.  Fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture.  Refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours.         Serve one scoop of mousse in an almond cookie shell.  Garnish with  raspberry puree and creme fraiche.
