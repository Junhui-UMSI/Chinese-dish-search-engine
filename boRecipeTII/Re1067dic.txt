Busted by JoAnn Pellegrino 8/98 NOTES  : Coriander sauce is a tart, tangy condiment that is spooned over grilled  kebabs, chops, and chicken. This version is a permanent fixture on the  Afghan table. Similar sauces are found as far east as India and as far west  as the Republic of Georgia. Walnuts help thicken and bind the sauce.    Recipe by: Barbecue!
