Cut in  shortening as you would for a pie crust. Stir in apples and raisins. Add  enough juice to make a stiff dough. On floured surface, roll dough about  1/2" thick. Cut into triangles and bake on cookie sheet for 10 minutes, or  until light brown.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
