Cold unsalted butter,, Salt, Butter, Sifted allpurpose unbleached, Heavy cream, Baking Powder, Granulated sugar, Buttermilk, 
In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle, combine the flour, sugar,  baking powder, and salt. After the dry ingredients are thoroughly blended,  add the buttermilk, cream and combine. Add the cold b utter in rapid  succession, combining only briefly, to leave the mixture as mealy as  possible.    Scrape this lumpy dough onto a lightly floured board and flatten gently  with a rolling pin into a rectangle shape approximately 1-inch thick. Cut  into 4 or 6 equal rounds. Brush a cookie sheet lightl y with melted butter,  place the rounds on the sheet and place the cookie sheet into the  refrigerator to rest for 20 minutes, while you preheat the oven to 375  degrees. Bake the chilled shortcakes for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they  are nicely browned.
