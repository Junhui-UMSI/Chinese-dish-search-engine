NOPE! This isnt a recipe.....but I sure wanted to keep this! --Glen Date:  Thu, 14 Mar 1996 16:47:11 -0800    From: Brent Thompson <brent@hplbct.hpl.hp.com>    > Are spiders harmful to plants?    No, they are beneficial, since they eat pests which attack/damage plants.  Except when they are babies, which can confound the picture for maybe a day  or two, spiders mostly are larger than, say, 1/8" across (finger-to-toe),  and dont travel in herds. > I recently moved to a new apt, and my > plants  are now the home to many small spiders.

Many mites, on the other hand, e.g. spider mites, are in the set of damage  causers.  Different types of spider mites vary of course, but most are 1mm  or smaller across (finger-to-toe), and once established tend to exist in  great population densities, like hundreds per leaf.    There are biological controls for spider mites, including various predatory  mites.    Mark Andersen <mnanders@ingr.com> wrote on 13Jan96 that aphids and fungus  gnats are controlled by spraying with a mixture of: 1 C. rubbing alcohol 3  C. water 1/8 C. Dawn dishwashing detergent    so maybe this will work for spider mites, too.  Ill probably try it this  year -- last summer spider mites ate up all my eggplant plants.  The life  cycle of spider mites is such that mite control spray programs usually  specify spraying at least three times, a week apart.    ~--   Brent    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #268    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
