Make a well in  the middle and add the eggs, milk, salt and vanilla. Beat these together  and gradually work on the flour. Roll out on a floured board to about 1/4  inch or a little thinner if preferred.    Cut the dough into 2 x 4-inch strips and simply make 3 or 4 slits in the  center of each. Fry in deep oil until golden brown. Sprinkle with powdered  sugar.  Yield: approximately 18 to 20.    HINT: These will be firmer than doughnuts.
