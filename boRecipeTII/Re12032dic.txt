When I first heard about Ari Weinzweigs delicatessen in Ann Arbor,  Michigan, I couldnt believe it. A deli in the home of my alma mater. Its  not really a deli but more of an international food emporium like New  Yorks Zabars with a definite Jewish touch. Mr. Weinzweig, a drop-out  Ph.D. candidate, has taken an academic and appetizing interest in updating  Jewish recipes like mushroom and barley soup, going back in history to the  nineteenth-century Eastern European version similar to that served at New  Yorks Second Avenue Deli.    1. Soak the mushrooms in enough hot water to cover for a half hour. Strain  through a filter. Reserve the water.    2. Coarsely chop the dried mushrooms.    3. Melt the margarine in a stockpot and saute the onion, celery, 2  tablespoons of the parsley, carrot, garlic, and fresh mushrooms until soft,  about 5 minutes.    4. Lower the heat and add the flour, stirring every 30 seconds for about 5  minutes or until thick.    5. In a soup pot heat the broth or water. Add a cup of mushroom mixture at  a time to the pot, stirring.    6. Turn the heat to high, and add the reserved mushroom water and barley.  Stir well and add salt to taste.    7. Simmer, covered, for about an hour or until the barley is tender and the  soup is thickened, stirring often.    8. Add additional chopped parsley, mix thoroughly, and adjust seasonings.    Yield: 6 to 8 servings (P) or (M)    Jewish Cooking in America Joan Nathan    Posted to recipelu-digest by Sandy <sandysno@pctech.net> on Feb 25, 1998
