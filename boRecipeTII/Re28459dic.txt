Baked or Grilled Fish with Dijon Glaze
Dry white wine, Lemon Herb Dijon Glaze, Fish fillets, Fresh herb, 
Preheat oven or grill to 500 degrees (or 450 degrees if that temperature is  just too scary at first). Heat the pan on high heat, until it is very hot.  While it is heating, brush glaze over all surfaces of the fish,  particularly all flesh.    To Bake: When the pan is hot (using potholders) put the fish in and brown  on one side. Turn the fish after 2 minutes and put the pan into the oven.  Bake for another few minutes. Remember: 5 minutes to the inch of thickness.    To Grill: Put fish on grill and cook, turning only once (for 5 minutes per  inch). Take the fish out of the oven or off the grill, and immediately  transfer it to a warmed serving dish or warmed individual plates.Add wine  to the pan and cook at medium high, whisking constantly until the sauce is  reduced by half. For grilling, cook wine and 1 tbsp. Dijon glaze in a small  pan. Pour over the fish, garnish with fresh herb, and serve immediately.    NOTES : You will need a heavy, oven-proof pan, preferably non-stick coated  or seasoned cast iron. A pan is not necessary for grilling. Before you make  the sauce or Demi-Glace make a slight separation in the flesh to stop the  cooking. Most fish is overcooked; its natural moisture is leached out by  prolonged heat, so its delicate texture becomes stringy or a little tough.  The less time fish is exposed to moisture-sapping heat, in the oven or on a  grill, the moister it will be. The hotter the heat, the less time it is  exposed. Dijon Glaze seals the pores of the flesh so fish can withstand 500  heat.
