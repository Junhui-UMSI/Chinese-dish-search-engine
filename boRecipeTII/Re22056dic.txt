Turkey Egg Rolls
Egg roll wrappers, turkey, Onion, Mushrooms, Margarine, cabbage, Carrots, celery, Soy sauce, 
Chop turkey, celery, and onion together. Add soy sauce and allow to stand  in refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Saute carrots in margarine. It takes  about 3 - 4 minutes to cook carrots. Add cabbage and mushrooms and cook  until cabbage is tender. Mix with the turkey, celery, and onion mixture.  Place two tablespoons of meat mixture on each egg roll. Roll and secure  with a corn starch/water paste. Deep fry or bake in a 350 degree oven for  10 minutes. I opted to bake. Not as good but less calories.
