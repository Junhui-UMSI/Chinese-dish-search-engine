By Madge Rosenberg    Left over bread makes a slightly sweet and spicy stuffing for chicken.    Add all ingredients except the raisins in the order suggested by your bread  machine manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the  manufacturers directions.    Add the raisins at the beeper or at the end of the first kneading in  machines without a beeper to signal addition of fruit and nuts.    This is very tasty.
