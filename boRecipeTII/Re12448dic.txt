1.  Cut two of the garlic heads in half across and remove the papery outer  skin.  Put these cut side down on a very hot surface - a griddle or black  iron skillet - until theyre black. Peel all the garlic completely. 2. Heat  the olive oil in a large saucepan and saute the onions, celery, and the  garlic until lightly browned at the edges. Add the wine and bring to a  boil. 3. Sprinkle in the flour and stir the pot thoroughly, but dont let  it brown.  Add the chicken stock, 1/2 gallon water, and the potato. Whisk  about the pot well and bring to a boil. Reduce to a rapid simmer and cook  for about an hour and 15 minutes. 4. Strain out the solids from the soup,  and puree them in a blender or food processor, along with enough broth to  ease things along. Return the puree to the soup and restore the boil. Add  the whipping cream, basil, thyme, salt, pepper and Tabasco. 5. Heat the  extra virgin olive oil in a skillet very hot. In it toast the slivers of  garlic until brown around the outside. 6 Ladle the soup into bowls and  garnish with roasted garlic slivers. Float a toasted, garlic-buttered slice  of French bread on top. Serves eight to twelve. Suggested wine: Marinasco  Chef Andrea Apuzzo writes of this recipe in his book "La Cucina di  Andreas", "Garlic wears many hats. Most people think of it in its  aggressive, green, aromatic, sharp form. But when garlic is cooked slowly  for a long time, it takes on a sweet nuttiness that is every bit as  interesting as its more raw flavors. The sweet side of garlic is  exemplified by this soup."
