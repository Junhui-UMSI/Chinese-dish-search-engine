Linda B in IL    Wrap tofu in several layers of toweling to drain off water, leave for 15  minutes. Clean onions and cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces, including tops. Keep  white separate from the green. Cut pieces lengthwise into slivers making  2-3 cuts in each piece. Coarsely chop the fresh herbs. Heat oil in wok or  heavy fry pan and saute the garlic cloves until transparent, removing them  to prevent burning, discard. Cut the drained tofu into 1/2 inch cubes and  saute in hot oil, gently turning each piece after it has browned, about  7-12 minutes. Continue sauteing until golden brown. Drain off excess oil.  Add spaghetti suace and carefully stir to coat all tofupieces. Add all the  whites of the onions and 1 /3 of the green pieces, lower heat, stir and  simmer over low heat for 3 minutes or longer. The longer you simmer it the  more the tofu will absorb the sauce. Add 1/3 of the greens and 1/2 of the  herbs, stir, and cook for an aditional 5 minutes. Serve garnished with the  remaining onion tops and herbs. Serves 4    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 473 by "lbrandau"  <lbrandau@intrnet.net> on Jan 7, 1998
