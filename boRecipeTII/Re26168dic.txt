From: Kathy Czopek <kcopek@icon-stl.net>    Date: 7 Sep 1995 15:53:41 -0500  For the health-conscious person who still craves the taste of chocolate  chip cookies. I have developed this recipe. Basically, it substitues  applesauce for part of the margarine, and thickens it up with oatmeal. Its  not 100% healthy, but its not nearly as bad as the real thing:    Combine butter, applesauce, sugars and vanilla in a large mixing bowl; mix  well. Add eggs; beat til well blended. Add flour, soda and salt. Mix well.  Stir in oatmeal and chips.    Put batter in a 13x9" pan that has been sprayed with cooking spray (i.e.,  Pam). Bake 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or til browned and springy to the  touch. Enjoy!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
