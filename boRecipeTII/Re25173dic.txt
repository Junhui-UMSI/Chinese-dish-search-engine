Tomato-Tofu over Rice (Or Pasta)
Onion, Several cloves of garlic (we, Ripe roma tomatoes, Like lots), Block low fat tofu, Red bell pepper (optional), 
Saute the onions and garlic in water or white wine, deglazing them a couple  of times.  Meanwhile cut up the tomatoes and rinse and cut up the tofu (I  love the White Wave version, since its firm enough not to fall apart when  stirred).  Add the tomatoes and tofu and cook until the tomatoes are nearly  ready and add the red pepper. The pepper should be barely cooked.    We serve this over Japanese rice cooked in a rice cooker, but other rices  and pasta are also good.  If we want more sauce or the tomatoes arent  exquisite, we sometimes stir in some pasta sauce along with the tomatoes.
