"Instant" Squash
Acorn; butternut or similar, Spices; (see below), Salt, 
Poke a hole or two in the squash and microwave until soft all over. About 4  ~ 8 minutes depending on size of squash) Cut in half. (It is very easy when  cooked) Scoop out seeds, mash squash, season and serve. Although I tend to  use lots of spices in things I only lightly use the chili, curry and  berberi mentioned below. In this case just a subtle tast of them works for  me. Season with one of the following combination:    1. Molly McButter or salt and Brown Sugar (husbands favorite)    2. Ethopian Berbere spice mix and salt and a few rasins or chopped apricots  (my favorite)    3. Your favorite curry mix, salt and a few rasins or chopped apricots.    4. Chilli powder and chopped sweet onions.    5. Salsa or Pico de Gallo    6. Pressed garlic and Molly McButter    7. Leftover chili beans or cooked veggies such as peas or broccli    7. Your own thing... I am sure you can think of better ones that what is  above. When you do let the rest of us know.
