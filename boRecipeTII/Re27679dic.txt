The Frugal Gourmets Homemade Salsa
garlic, Green bell pepper, Salt, tomatoes, Jalapeno peppers, Fresh Cilantro, Canned tomato sauce, Salsa jalapena, Red wine vinegar, Yellow onions, 
Fresh salsa is surprisingly easy to make and so much better than  supermarket sauce. It will keep several days in the refrigerator.    Do not cook. Simply mix all ingredients well and add salsa jalapena to  taste. Careful, the stuff is HOT!! Store in the refrigerator, covered, in  plastic. Use on salads, on top of fried or scrambled eggs, as a dip, etc.  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #295 by Judy Howle <howle@ebicom.net> on  Apr 15, 1997
