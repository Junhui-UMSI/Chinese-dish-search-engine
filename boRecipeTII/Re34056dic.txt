Place the wild rice in a large saucepan; cover with 1 quart water, add 1/2  teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil; cover  and cook until the grains are tender but still chewy, about 30 to 35  minutes.    Bring the remaining 3 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan; add  the basmati rice and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until  just tender. Drain and cool, then add to the wild rice.    In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the tangerine juice just to  boiling; pour over the currants to plump them. Peel and section the  tangerines, removing the seeds and threads.    Toss the rice with the currants, tangerine juice, 1/2 tablespoon Champagne  vinegar, and the olive oil. If necessary, adjust the seasoning with salt  and a splash of vinegar. Add the tangerines and the toasted pine nuts just  before serving at room temperature.    VARIATION: Use oranges and their juice in place of tangerines. Using a  sharp knife, remove the peel and white pith from the orange by slicing off  the top and bottom, then working down the sides. Hold the orange over a  bowl to catch the juice and cut each section loose by slicing down next to  the membrane.
