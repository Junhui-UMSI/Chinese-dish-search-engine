Here is a recipe I found for a carrot pudding which sounds delicious.    Mix thoroughly carrots, apple, lemon rind, juice, potato flour, matzo meal,  sugar wine, and egg yolks. Beat egg whites until stiff and fold into carrot  mixture. Pour into well greased 8 x 8 inch pan and bake at 375degrees for       45    minutes. Serve hot.    Wine Sauce: Combine water, honey and potato flour in saucepan. Cover and  cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth. Beat  egg yolks well and without washing beaters add a small amount of hot  mixture slowly. Slowly add to saucepan, stirring constantly. When  thoroughly mixed, remove from heat. Stir in wine; beat egg whites and fold  into mixture. Add rind. Pour over pudding.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Dobie607 <Dobie607@aol.com> on Apr 6, 1998
