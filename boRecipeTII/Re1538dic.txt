Brown Sugar Angel Food Cake
Egg whites at room, Cream of tartar, Flour, Sifted light brown sugar, 
(from Martha Stewart, I think)    Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit. Sift the flour together with 3/4 C brown  sugar. Reserve. Beat the egg whites until foamy, then add the cream of  tartar. Beat on high speed until tripled in volume. Sprinkle (like brown  sugar can be sprinkled!) half the remaining sugar on top of the egg whites  and beat until incorporated. Repeat with remaining sugar. Beat mixture on  high speed until stiff and glossy. Fold in the flour/sugar mixture in three  additions. Spoon the cake batter into an ungreased 10 inch angel food cake  pan with a removable bottom. Run a knife through the batter to remove any  large air bubbles. Bake for 45 minutes until cake is golden brown. Invert  and cool completely, about an hour. Remove from pan.    This is really good served with a blueberry sauce, or your favorite fruit  sauce.    My notes: I didnt use cake flour, but regular (Southern) flour. The cake  browned early, but didnt get overly brown so I left it in the full 45  minutes and it is fine. I think its pretty important that the cake pan  have a removable bottom so that the cake can be removed without too much  mangling.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Susan Y.
