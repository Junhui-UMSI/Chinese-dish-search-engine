It is modified very little  from Diet for a New World, by John Robbins (my favorite cookbook - not  lowfat, but easily adaptable).    In a large pot, saute over medium heat the onion, carrots, celery, bell  pepper and garlic until softened, about 7 minutes.  Add the spices and stir  for 30 seconds.  Stir in the beans, tomato sauce, tomatoes, and vegetable  stock.  Cook, partially covered, until thickened, about 20 minutes.  Stir  in the corn and cook for 5 minutes. Remove bay leaves and serve.    One good way to serve the chili is with tortillas, salsa and sour cream.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #142    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
