Raw Fish Salad (Japanese Sashimi)
Water, Horseradish, Gingerroot, fresh, Mustard sauce, fresh salad, Bass, 
In this popular dish, the Japanese enjoy eating their fish completely raw,  cut in slivers about 1/4 inch thick, and dipped into a mixture of fresh  chopped gingerroot, grated horseradish and mustard. We add dishes of very  fresh greens, turning the Sashimi into a salad.    If your fish is very, very fresh, your dishes colorful and attractively  arranged, and if you accompany your first bite of raw fish with a generous  mouthful of crisp greens, you will probably be able to overcome your  prejudices and discover what the Japanese have known for centuries: fish  doesnt have to be cooked to taste good.    INSTRUCTIONS: Set out the slivered fish, 3 dishes of seasonings and salad  greens and let everyone mix his own sauce, tasting and testing as he does,  and help himself to greens.
