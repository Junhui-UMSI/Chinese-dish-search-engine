Lemon Poppy Seed Cake
Apple juice, Baking soda, Poppy seeds, Lemon juice, Lemons; zested, Sea salt, Canola oil, Pure maple syrup, Whole wheat pastry flour; or, 
Mix dry ingredients. Mix wet ingredients. Fold gently together. Pour into  greased and floured 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan. Bake in preheated 350 degree (F)  oven for 1/2 hour or until toothpick comes clean.    This is a light, not too sweet lemon cake with a lovely snappy crunch from  the poppyseeds. Makes a nice tea cake as is.This recipe was printed about a  year ago in the newsletter of the Ocean Beach (San Diego) Peoples Food  Co-op. I made it last week, and enjoyed it... since I dont eat dairy  products, I frosted it with a mixture of 1/2 pound tofu blended in a  blender with 1/4 cup margarine and maple syrup, vanilla and lemon juice to  taste. By the way, I think it would be better with slightly fewer  poppyseeds...
