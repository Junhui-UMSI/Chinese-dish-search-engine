Brown ground beef in its own fat (or use a little oil) along with the  garlic. When its gone gray, add rice wine, fish sauce, and  scallions. Cook a minute, then add hoisin, bean paste, and cornstarch  mixed with water. Cook a minute or two until cornstarch has thickened  and set aside.    Meanwhile, cook and drain the noodles as you would any other noodles.    Mound the noodles on a platter and arrange the bean sprouts over the  top. Pour the hot (or warm, at least) meat sauce over and strew with  scallions. Serve hot or cool.
