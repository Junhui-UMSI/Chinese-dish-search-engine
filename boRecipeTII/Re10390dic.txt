Quick Chicken Wing Sauce
Red Devil Hot Sauce, Medium or Hot Salsa/Picante, Honey, Lemon juice, Dry mustard, 
Measurements are not exact!  Youll have to experiment until you get the  taste YOU want.  For a small amount of this sauce, start with one cup of  Salsa.  Add about 3 T honey, 1 T lemon juice (dont need this, but it adds  some tartness), and a few shakes of Red Devil hot sauce (or Tabasco).  Instead of Red Devil or Tabasco, use dry mustard which doesnt "take over"  the sauce as much as Red Devil or Tabasco.    Mix well.  Taste.  If not hot enough, use Hot Salsa or Hot Picante and/or  add more Red Devil.
