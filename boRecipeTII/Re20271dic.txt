** If you have previously prepared Veal Stock - the simplest thing to  do is to take a 1/2 cup of the veal stock and boil it until it reduces to  about 2 tablespoons and takes on the consistency of thick syrup.  If you  dont have Veal Stock handy, then you follow this recipe to make the stock  first.         Preheat oven to 450 F.         Put the oil in a roasting pan and heat briefly in the oven.         Add the bones to the oil in the pan, toss to coat and roast for       35    minutes.         Add the onions, carrots, celery, leek, garlic and parsley,  tossing them all to coat with fat.  Roast 30 minutes longer.         Remove the pan from the oven and transfer the bones and  vegetables to a clean stockpot.  Drain off as much of the fat as  possible.         Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat (use 2 burners if  neces-) (sary), and add 2 cups of cold water and boil briefly.  Scrape  up all of the browned bits into the water.         Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that  forms.         Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and  salt.  Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary  just to cover the ingredients.  Skim whenever necessary.         Add peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.         Strain the "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with  a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.  Gently press the solids to  extract all of the liquid, and discard the solids.         Pour the stock into containers for storage and label and date  them.         The stock will "keep" for up to 3 days in a refrigerator, and up  to 6 months in a freezer.         This stock is now used to make the Glaze as noted in the beginning of  these directions.
