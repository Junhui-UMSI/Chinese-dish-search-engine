Preheat the oven to 325~ F. "Just the thing to nibble with a cup of mulled  wine or hot spiced apple cider, these simple, versatile crackers also lend  themselves beautifully to cheeses, dips, and spicy spreads. 325~ F 20 to 25  minutes In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flours,  sugar, and salt. Cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles  coarse meal. Blend in the milk slowly, using only enough to form a dough  that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal  portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll the  crackers thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch. If desired, lightly sprinkle the tops with  salt and gently roll over the dough with your rolling pin. With a sharp  knife, cut the crackers into 2-inch squares. Transfer them to an ungreased  baking sheet. Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the crackers are lightly browned. Cool  on a rack.
