In a skillet heat the oil, and brown the chicken.  Remove to a platter and  keep warm.  To the skillet add the onions and garlic, cooking over medium  heat, stirring occasionally, 3-4 minutes.  Add the flour, wine and chicken  broth, stirring with a wire whisk and cook until the mixture is thickened.  Add the 1/2 can of tomatoes and the salt and pepper.  Return the chicken to  the skillet, cover and simmer til tender, about 30 minutes.  Remove the  chicken from the skillet and transfer to a platter and keep warm.  To the  skillet add the reserved tomatoes and simmer for 15 minutes.  Add the  cilantro or parsley and simmer another minute longer. Pour over the chicken  and serve.    This recipe was given to me by a woman from Spain, hence "spanish" chicken.
