Tiropitas (Greek Cheese Pastry)
Small curd cottage cheese, Butter, Feta cheese, Eggs, chives, Filo dough, 
Mix everything but the butter and dough together. Cut the dough into 4 or 5  even sets of strips and cover them while you work with wax paper and a  moist dish towel.    Lay out one strip, brush lightly with butter, and repeat with a second  layer. Put a teaspoon of filling at one end, and fold a corner over the  filling. Starting with this initial triangle, fold the dough up like a flag  until you have a little turnover. Repeat for the rest of the dough and  filling, laying them out on a cookie sheet.    Bake at 350? for 20 minutes until brown.    WARNING: when these come out of the oven, the filling remains very hot for  quite a while after the tiropitas themselves are cool enough to handle.  Watch out, if you dont want to see your guests in court seeking damages  for seared palates.    Yields: 50 to 60    NOTES : Flaky cheese triangles.
