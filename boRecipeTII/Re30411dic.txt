Recipe by: Rose Murray, The Christmas Cookbook Great Canadian Prepare two 2  Litre (9" x 5") loaf pans. Preheat oven to 300 F. In a large bowl combine  the fruit, dates, pineapple and walnuts. Dredge them with 1/4 cup of the  flour.  Sift the remaining flour together with the baking powder, baking  soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Set aside. Cream the butter, add  the sugar and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs,  one at a time. Beat in the orange rind, orange juice and orange extract.  Mash the bananas with a fork.  (A food processor will tend to liquefy the  bananas and this will change the texture of the cake.) Alternately stir the  bananas and the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Stir in the floured  fruit and nuts. Turn into the prepared pans and bake for 2 hours and 15  minutes, or until  a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out  clean. Cool in the pans for 20 minutes, then turn out onto racks. Yields  about 5 pounds of cake.
