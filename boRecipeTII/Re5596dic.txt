Heres a recipe for pineapple salsa that I cant remember from whence it  came. Ive modified the original one a bit, so you may want to modify it to  your tastes.    Combine all ingredients and chill in the fridge before serving.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #145    Date: 30 Oct 96 11:35:49 EDT    From: David.Gardner@dbsoftware.com (David Gardner)
