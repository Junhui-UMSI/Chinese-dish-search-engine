See recipe: Basic White Bread by James Beard, for instructions on kneading.  That is a "real" load of bread!  :-) * Instructions * Proof the yeast in the water in a large mixing bowl or  the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the dry milk, sugar, butter, salt,  optional garlic, and 2 cups flour. Beat the batter by hand or with an  electric mixer at medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining flour  by hand and stir the mixture well to make a soft dough. Cover it with a  damp towel and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 40 minutes  or until it is double in bulk. Preheat the oven to 375dF. Uncover the risen  dough and stir it vigorously for 1 minute. Butter a 1-1/2 quart  straight-sided casserole or souffle dish and put in the batter. Brush the  top with the egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake the bread in the  center of the oven for about 1 hour, or until it is delicately browned and  sounds hollow when rapped with the knuckles. Remove from the casserole dish  and serve warm, cut into wedges.
