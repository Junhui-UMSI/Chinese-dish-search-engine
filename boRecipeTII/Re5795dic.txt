Pint-Sized Bread Pudding
Raisins, Melted butter/magarine, Cinnamon, Whole wheat or white bread, Egg, Brown or granulated sugar, Vanilla, milk, 
This is a recipe I got from the Toronto Star.  Im not really sure if this  is what youre looking for, but I thought Id send it anyway.  It was in a  section on cooking for one or two, so its a smaller more simple recipe,  but Ive found it a great way to use up those left over pieces of bread  that always hang around the refrigerator.     While preheating oven to 350F, dry - but dont toast - bread. Cut into 1/2  inch cubes.     Brush 3-cup casserole with a litlle melted butter. Place bread cubes in  casserole.  Sprinkle with raisins.     Scald milk in small saucepan until hot, but not boiling.  Lightlyt beat  egg.  Stir in remaining butter, milk, sugar, vanilla and cinnimon.  Pour  over bread mixture, pushing bread under liquid.     Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until knife inserted near centre comes out clean.  Makes 2 servings.    APETERS@JULIAN.UWO.CA    (A.A.
