To Make Tortelloni Al Forno:    Preheat oven to 425 F. Bring 6 quarts of water to boil and add 2  tablespoons salt.    Heat oil in a 12 to 14-inch saute pan until smoking and add onions. Cook  onions until softened but not brown, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add radicchio  and cook until softened and lightly gray in color, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.    Meanwhile, drop tortellini into boiling water and cook until tender. Gently  drain and place in a large mixing bowl. Add cooled radicchio mixture,  balsamella and half the grated cheese. Gently stir to mix well. Divide  among 4 buttered gratin dishes, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake  until bubbly and crusty on top, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
