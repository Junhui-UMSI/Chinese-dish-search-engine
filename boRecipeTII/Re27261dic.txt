Marsalla, Lemon rind, Sugar, Whipping cream, Lady fingers, Eggs, Mascarpone cheese, Espresso coffee; cold, Bittersweet chocolate;, 
Use Italian lady fingers also called Savoiardi, for the best results. You  can use any kind of spirits or liqueurs in the dessert (marsala, vin santo,  rum, brandy, Tia Maria, Frangelico, Amaretto) be guided by your own tastes.  If you cant find mascarpone, use 8oz ricotta and double the amount of  whipping cream. If you dont have an espresso maker, use strong black  coffee. 1. In a heavy pot, on medium-low heat, whisk together sugar and  eggs until frothy. Continue whisking until mixture begins to thicken. Whisk  in 1/4 cup marsala and continue to cook until mixture coats the back of a  spoon. Scrape into bowl and reserve. 2. Whip cream until it holds its  shape. With same beaters, whisk mascarpone and lemon rind together until  mixture softens. Fold in egg/marsala mixture and whipping cream. 3. Combine  espresso and remaining 2Tb marsala. Dip lady fingers into coffee mixture  two at a time and soak evenly. Place a layer of lady fingers on bottom of  11x7 inch dish. Spread with half of the mascarpone creame. Sprinkle with  grated chocolate. Add another layer of soaked lady fingers. Top with  mascarpone cream and remaining chocolate.
