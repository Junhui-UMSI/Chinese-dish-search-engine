Cookies: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease cookie sheet with  unsalted shortening. Sift together flour and salt into a large bowl. Add  half the butter and cut it in with a pastry blender or two knives until the  mixture looks like coarse meal. Cut in remaining butter until it looks like  large peas. Add crumbled yeast. Add sour cream and mix well. Beat egg yolks  until frothy; add vanilla and blend egg mixture into butter mixture. If  necessary, knead dough on a lightly floured board until smooth. Divide  dough into 8 parts and roll one portion at a time. On a floured board, roll  each portion into 8 wedge-shaped pieces. Place 1 teaspoonful of the Nut  Filling at the wider edge of each wedge. Roll up each wedge, starting at  the wide side, and place on prepared cookie sheet with the point  underneath. Bake 20-22 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove cookies to  wire cake racks and cool. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar when cooled.  Makes 64 cookies.     NOTE: 1 package active dry yeast dissolved in 2 tablespoons warm water  (105-115 degrees) may be substituted for cake yeast.     Nut Filling: In the small bowl of an electric mixer beat egg whites until  soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and vanilla and beat until stiff peaks  form. Blend in ground nuts.
