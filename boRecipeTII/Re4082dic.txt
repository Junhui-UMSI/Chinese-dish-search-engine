Peppermint Tea
Peppermint leaves, 
Boil a handfull of peppermint leaves in a pot of water and strain. Add  sugar to taste and serve over ice. Wonderful peppermint drink -- tastes a  lot like candy canes, but very summery. Also good hot. Leftovers can be  frozen in an ice cube tray and popped into iced tea to make it minty.
