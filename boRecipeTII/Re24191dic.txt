Place the eggplant slices on an oiled baking sheet, salt them lightly, and  cover them with aluminum foil. Bake at 400-F. until tender, 20 to 25  minutes. Lower oven to 350. Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until  translucent. Add the mushrooms and continue to cook,covered, on medium heat  until the mushrooms have released their juices and become soft. Stir in the  tomatoes, marjoram, thyme, paprika, salt and black pepper.Cover and simmer  for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain off most of the juice. Set  aside. Combine the rice, lemon juice, parsley, and pine nuts. To assemble  the casserole, oil a 9x13x2 1/2-inch baking dish. Spread half the rice  mixture on the bottom and cover with half the eggplant slices. Spoon half  the sauteed vegetables on top of the eggplant layer. Repeat this process  using the remaining rice, eggplant, and vegetables. Pour the eggs evenly  over the top of the casserole so that they drizzle down into it. Combine  the breadcrumbs and nuts and saute them on low heat in the oil or butter  for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Top the casserole with the nut  mixture and bake it, covered, at 350, for about 30 minutes. Then uncover  and bake for 10 minutes until the top is crisp and the casserole still  moist. Garnish with parsley and peppers.
