Mix butter, corn syrup, brown sugar, chili powder, cinnamon  and red papper flakes in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour  mixture over items in roasting pan. Bake at 250 degrees for 1 hour,  stirring every 15 minutes. Afer baking, spread onto large sheet of waxed  paper to cool.  I usually double this recipe.
