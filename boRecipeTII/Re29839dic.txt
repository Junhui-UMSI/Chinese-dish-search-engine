Tender Meatballs in Mushroom Gravy
Beef;lean ground, Pepper, Water, Salt, Mushroom soup, Onion minced, Bread slices, 
Pull apart bread into small, dime-size pieces. Combine  ground beef, bread, salt, pepper, and minced onion in  a large mixing bowl. Using a spoon, scoop out rounds  of meat mixture, or shape into several round, 2-inch  balls by hand. Brown meatballs in a hot skillet using  a small amount of butter or oil. Turn them  occasionally so all sides are browned. Place meatballs  in a crockpot. Add soup and water. Cook on low for 6  to 12 hours, high for up to 6 hours.
