White Beans
Onions, diced, Bottles catsup, salt and pepper, White beans, Chili sauce, Water, Prepared mustard, Ham hocks, Brown sugar (or less), 
Soak the beans overnight. Cook beans in water with ham hocks and onions  until nearly done. Remove the ham hocks and take meat off bones. Put meat  back in the beans and add the remaining ingredients. Bottle and pressure  for 1 hour at 10 pounds pressure. Makes about 30 pints. "When I made mine,  I used a medium size shoulder ham roast instead of the ham hocks and added  more mustard."    Recipe by: Dorothy Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #537 by hister@juno.com  (Iris E.
