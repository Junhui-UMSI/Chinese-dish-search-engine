This recipe is adapted from Stalking The Healthful Herbs by Euell Gibbons.  If you are interested in additional violet recipes, look for this book  which contains six more.    Make an infusion with violets and water by placing your blossoms in a glass  jar and covering them with boiling water. Put a lid on the jar, and set  aside for 24 hours. The infusion will turn a murky bluish green. Strain and  discard the violets. Add the lemon juice to the violet infusion, and it  transforms to a clear lavender pink. Stir in powdered pectin, and bring to  a boil. Add 4 cups sugar, bring to a boil again, and boil vigorously for  one minute. Skim if necessary. Pour into sterile jars and seal.    Makes approximately 2 1/2 cups jelly.  Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 27, 1998
