Whisk eggs lightly.  Whisk in rest of liquid ingredients. Gradually sift in  dry ingredients, whisking after each addition. Stir herbs into the batter  and let sit covered for an hour, or cover and refrigerate until ready to  make crepes.    With a fork, beat up and blend filling ingredients. Make the crepes being  sure to stir each time as the onion tends to sink to the bottom. With a  rubber spatula, spread a thick coat of the filling over each crepe.    Brush the rolled up crepes with melted butter, then roll in grated parmesan  cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, then turn oven to broil for a  minute or two to lightly brown the tops.
