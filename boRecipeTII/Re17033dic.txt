Vietnamese Lemongrass Chicken
Lemongrass; about 4 stalks,, Scallion; all of them, Frying chicken, GARNISH, Sugar, Nuoc Mam  **, Salt, Coriander leaves; chopped, Red chile peppers; chopped, Black pepper; freshly ground, Dry-roasted peanuts; chopped, Peanut oil, 
Hack the chicken into small serving pieces, chopping through the bones with  a very sharp cleaver.    Remove the outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely slice the tender white  part at the base of the stalks. Bruise with a mortar and pestle or the  handle of a cleaver. Finely slice the scallions, including the green tops.    Mix the chicken with the salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the lemongrass and  scallions and set aside for 30 minutes.  Heat a wok and add the oil, and  when the oil is hot add the chicken mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add  chile peppers and stir-fry on medium heat for 10 minutes or until chicken  no longer looks pink. Season with sugar and pepper and add the chicken  stock. Stir for a few minutes. Garnish with the peanuts, "nuoc mam" and  coriander.  Serve with rice, if desired.    This quickly prepared but terrifically flavorful dish is great served with  rice paper wrappers.  I love it with a few leaves of mint and basil.  This  is one you must try. It is easily done in a wok.
