Pats comments.... "This bread is really good. It can be used on the timer.  On my Panasonic I use the regular cycle, but with the light crust due to  all the juices in it. Makes a beautiful high rising loaf with a warm  cinnamon color. Definitely use the vital gluten as it rises much better. I  use frozen apple juice concentrate. You could also add raisins or chopped  apples, either fresh or dried, or even nuts might be nice. Fits McD  beautifully, dont you think?!"
