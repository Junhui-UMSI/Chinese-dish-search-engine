Aunt Junes Pecan-Less Sandies
Rolled oats, Flour, Egg, Chopped pecans (optional, I, Margerine, softened (2, Vanilla, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Crushed corn flakes, Baking soda, Vegetable oil, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In large mixer bowl, cream butter and sugars  until fluffy. Add oil, vanilla, and egg, beating well. Hy band, stir in  oats, corn flakes, and nuts, if desired. Mix well.    Combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to mixture and mix well by hand.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with a  fork.    Bake for 12 minutes. Remove from oven, and cool for about a minute before  removing from pan. Then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Makes  about 8 dozen cookies.    Personal notes: This recipe is perfect because it tastes like it has nuts  but it doesnt. Great for Rebekahs nut allergy. It is a crispy cookie, but  not flat....    I used my small cookie dough scoop on this and ended up with about 8-9  dozen cookies...the same size as the Keebler Pecan Sandy. This has a taste  very similar to the Keeblers, but no nuts.
