Mix spices and place in a bowl, add 6-8 fl oz (175-250 ml) of vinegar.  Mix  the spice into the vinegar, adding water if needed to make a creamy paste.  Let this stand for a while, 1/2 hour is best.    Meanwhile heat 6-8 fl oz (175-250 ml) vegetable oil. Add paste to the oil,  care is needed here as it will splatter very easily. Stir the paste for  about 5 mins, do not let it stick. Remove from heat and stand for 5-10  mins, if the oil rises to the top the spices are cooked, if not add more  oil and cook again for a while, dont forget to keep stiring.    Bottle the paste, (sterile jars essential) and cap with hot oil. This is  well worth the trouble to make and will store for a long time. It never  lasts long in my house though= !!!
