Barbs Meatloaf with Cheese
Pepper, Cheddar cheese; cubed, Paprika, Egg, Onion, Ground beef, Bread crumbs; dry, Celery seed, Bell pepper; chopped, milk, Salt, 
OVEN TEMP: 350 DEGREES MIX ALL INGREDIENTS TOGETHER. PLACE IN LOAF PAN.  BAKE FOR 1 HOUR 15 MIN. *I LIKE TO FORM THIS IN A BALL AND PLACE IT ON A  RACK TO COOK, SO THAT MOST OF THE FAT DRIPS AWAY FROM THE MEAT. THIS MEAT  LOAF MAKES GREAT SANDWICHES AND IS FLAVORFUL WHEN COLD.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "John Weber" <hdbrer@ibm.net> on Mar 22, 98
