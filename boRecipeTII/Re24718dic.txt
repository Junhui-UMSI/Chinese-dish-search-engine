Rinse the aubergines, discard stems and cut in half lengthways. Scoop out  centre of each aubergine and reserve, leaving about half-inch shell of  flesh. Sprinkle each shell with salt, then turn over and leave to drain for  30 minutes. Chop up the remaining flesh.    Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4.    Dry-fry the lamb and chopped aubergine over a moderate heat for 5 minutes,  stirring frequently until browned. Drain off any fat, then add the garlic  and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat.    Add the spring onion, tomatoes, grated lemon rind, mint and seasoning to  taste. Mix well and bind with the beaten egg.    Rinse the aubergine halves and pat dry with kitchen paper. Fill the shells  with the prepared stuffing mixture, packing down firmly. Place in an oiled  ovenproof dish and drizzle with the oil. Cover and bake in the preheated  oven for 40 minutes or until aubergines are tender, basting occasionally  with the oil in the dish.    Garnish with chopped mint. Serve with cacik, green salad and freshly baked  bread.    Source: Take a Break
