Baked Orange-Pineapple
Butter or oleo, White bread; cubed, Eggs, Can Mandarin oranges;, Sugar, Crushed pineapple; drained, 
Cream together butter and sugar until light. Add eggs one at a time and  beat well. Stir in oranges, pineapple and bread cubes. Turn into a greased  1 3/4 qt.casserole and bake at 350 degrees for 50 -60 minutes or until  golden brown. Makes 6 servings.    Note: I always double this recipe. It is especially good with baked ham or  roast pork.    Posted to recipelu-digest by P&S Gruenwald <sitm@ne.infi.net> on Feb 23,  1998
