If  you think it is too sweet add bottled water,but remember the ice will melt.  Right before serving, add the sherbet or sorbet to the punch and Serve. You  can add Champagne or non alcholic sparkling cider to give it some kick.  Actually, you can use any fruit juice that you like,it just changes the  taste I like using the pink lemonade,because of its tartness.
