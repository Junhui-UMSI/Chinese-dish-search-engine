Green olives; pitted, Handful fresh chopped, Or more Tb butter, Artichoke hearts; in oil,, Portion cooked orzo, Raw jumbo shrimp;, Black olives; pitted, Dried tarragon;, Ripe cherry tomatoes, 
Melt the butter in a saute pan over fairly high heat. Toss in the remaining  ingredients, except the orzo, all at once. Let it all sizzle up, turning  the shrimp once, and immediately serve over the orzo the moment the shrimp  are cooked. It takes just minutes. In the restaurant, each portion was  cooked to order in its own little pan. Four or so portions can be prepared  at a time in a 12-inch or larger pan. The ingredients should not be  crowded. NOTES  : This dish was created for visual and culinary effect. It turned out to be  an all-time favorite at Alices Restaurant. Serves 1.
