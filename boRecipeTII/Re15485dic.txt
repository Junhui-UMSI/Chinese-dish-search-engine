The cheesecake  is quite versatile and I have played around with it quite a bit.    Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. At the same time mix the cream  cheese, yogurt, sucant and vanilla. Add the melted chips, lemon zest and  beat well for 5 min. Pour into graham cracker crust and bake @ 350 till  firm (45m to 1 hr) chill before serving.    Hints: The recipie originally called for sour cream instead of yogurt and  apricot brandy instead of lemon zest and poundcake crumbs instead of graham  crackers.  I like the yogurt better, never tried the brandy and havent  found eggless poundcake. With the yogurt Ive noticed that the cake will be  a little soupy when you get it out of the oven and    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
