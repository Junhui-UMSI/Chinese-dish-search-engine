Peerless Cornbread
Sugar, Cake flour, Salt, Yellow cornmeal, Butter; (1 stick)  melted, Baking Powder, Vegetable oil, Egg; room temperature, Milk; warmed, 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-inch round, 1 1/2-inch deep  cake pan. With a fork, stir together the cake flour, cornmeal, baking  powder, salt and sugar. Beat the egg, melted butter, oil and milk in a  large mixing bowl until well blended. Add the dry ingredients to the egg  mixture and stir until blended. The batter will be somewhat thin and light.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 15 minutes, until  a straw inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Press the  center of the bread; if it feels slightly firm the bread is done. Be  careful not to overbake. Serve warm wedges of the cornbread with butter and  honey. Yield: 1 9-inch round loaf  Recipe By     : BAKERS DOZEN (MARION CUNNINGHAM) SHOW #BD1A03    Posted to EAT-L Digest 14 October 96    Date:    Tue, 15 Oct 1996 20:20:24 -0500    From:    Jackie Bordelon <jbord@PREMIER.NET>
