*Venison is available at specialty meat markets. May substitute beef    Place venison in a large stainless steel or glass bowl. Scatter onion  pieces over the meat. Combine brandy, 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper,  olive oil and pour over the meat and onion. Cover the bowl and refrigerate  8 hours or overnight, turning meat at least once.    Remove meat and onion pieces from marinade. Dry both on paper towels and  reserve marinade.    In a Dutch oven or another casserole with a tight-fitting lid, saute bacon  in 1 tablespoon butter until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove  bacon and drain on paper towels. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons drippings.  Add onion pieces and saute over medium heat until they begin to soften. Add  meat and brown it on all sides.    Sprinkle flour over meat and stir for 1 to 2 minutes without burning flour.  Add marinade and wine and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape browned bits  from the bottom of the pan until liquid boils and thickens. Add parsley,  garlic, thyme and bay leaf. Lower heat to a bare simmer, cover pan and cook  until meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.    Heat remaining tablespoon butter in a saute pan. Add the mushrooms and  pearl onions and saute over medium-high heat until they soften and begin to  brown.    Transfer meat to a serving platter or plates, add the mushrooms, pearl  onions and reserved bacon and keep warm. Strain the sauce into a clean pan.  Reheat sauce, season to taste and pour over the meat.    Serve with a rich red wine such as Chateauneuf du Pape.
