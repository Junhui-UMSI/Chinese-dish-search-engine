Tofu-Courgette on a Skewer
Basil, Eggs, Courgette, S&P ; to taste, Mustard, Mild paprika, Margarine, Lemon juice, Flour; divided 2T + 4T, Tofu, 
Ahead: Cut the tofu into blocks of about 2cm. Stir together lemon juice,  basil, salt, pepper, and mustard in a medium bowl. Toss in the tofu blocks.  Let marinate  at least 2 hours.    When ready to cook: Wash courgette and cut into slices of about 1-1/2cm.    Put 2T flour into a deep plate. In another deep plate, beat together the  eggs and paprika. Add the remaining flour, stirring till smooth.    Remove the tofu blocks from the marinade and dry with paper towels. Dip  each block in the flour and then in the batter. Repeat with the courgette  slices.    In a large frying pan, heat the margarine. Add the tofu blocks and  courgette slices; cook, stirring, until golden, about 5 min.    Divide among 4 wooden skewers. Lekker with frites and iceberg sla. [Or over  rice or noodles, with a side salad.]  [I think sticking these onto skewers after theyre already cooked is a  silly idea.    Just dump them (attractively) on a plate and serve.]  Recipe By     : Tip    Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 November 96    Date:    Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:31:11 +0100    From:    Kaye Sykes <Sykes.Kaye@UNIFACE.NL>    NOTES : Once the tofu is marinated, this is fast.
