At times potatoes  were used to stretch a meager amount of flour to produce larger quantities  of bread. They also game it a rich, soft texture and thin, crisp crust.    For variation, try adding either caraway seeds or snipped fresh chives.    ALLOW AT LEAST ONE HOUR BEFORE MAKING THIS BREAD TO PREPARE THE MASHED  POTATOES.
