Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Preheat the broiler. Prepare the cabernet  sauce: Saute the vegetables until limp. Deglaze the pan with the wine. Add  the tomato paste, chopped tomato and lamb stock. Simmer, partially covered,  until reduced by half. Add the flour. Cook, stirring, until the sauce  thickens. Set aside 1/2 of the sauce. Prepare the barbecue sauce: Combine  the ingredients. Mix a small amount of the barbecue sauce with the  remaining cabernet sauce. Strain. Season to taste. Season the rack of lamb  to taste. Sear the lamb under the broiler (1-2" from the heat source).  Brush the lamb liberally with the cabernet sauce-barbecue sauce mixture.  Roll the meat in the ground pecans, coating thoroughly. Place the meat on a  rack in the oven. Roast until the nuts are toasted and the meat is medium  rare. Slice in 3 pieces, pour over some of the reserved cabernet sauce and  serve.
