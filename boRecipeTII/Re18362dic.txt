Very best lobster dish: Steam 1 big lobster per person over sea water. The  really big ones (2+ lb.) arent done as soon as they turn red - let them  cook a couple more minutes beyond that; little lobsters are ready as soon  as they turn red. Have an assistant remove the claw meat (keep whole) and  whatever knuckle meat and roe (s)he can find while you take the tails and  either (depending on their size) halve them lengthwise or cut them through  the shell into slices. Heat a big knob of butter in a big saucepan and toss  the tail pieces in the hot butter for a minute. Remove the tails to a hot  platter. Dump the shallots and mushrooms in the same butter and toss for a  minute; then remove them to the same platter. While the butter is still  hot, add white wine and bourbon (Cognac will do); let cook down for 15 secs  or so and then add cream, slowly and keeping the heat high. While your  assistant arranges the tails on individual plates, with the claws and maybe  some watercress or parsley as garnish, keep an eye on the sauce as it  thickens. When the sauce is thick, add a little salt if you need it and  dump in the onions, mushrooms, roe, and knuckle meat. Pour sauce over  lobster tails and serve at once. Save the tomalley for: Tomalley  croustades. Fry rounds from a baguette or other very thin loaf in butter  until they just begin to turn golden. Drain on paper towels. When they are  cool, spread them with lobster tomalley mixed with heavy cream to make a  thick paste. You may grate a tiny bit of Gruyere or other Swiss-style  cheese over each one. Put under the broiler for a few seconds until the  tops bubble.
