Sprinkle with the 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon combined. Place in hot  oven. Meanwhile beat egg, add sugar, then vanilla. Stir in Bisquick, then  melted marg and coconut. Spread over hot apples and bake 25-30 minutes  until apples are tender and topping is nicely browned. I double this  recipe.  Its also good with fresh peaches.
