In saucepan of boiling salted  water, cook asparagus for about 10-minutes or until tender; drain.  In food  processor or blender, process until smooth.  There should be about 2 cups  puree.  Transfer to saucepan.  Add mayonnaise, lemon juice and onion; cook  over low heat just until warmed through.    Meanwhile, in small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water; let stand for 5  minutes to soften.    Over low heat, warm gelatin until disolved; stir into asparagus mixture.  Transfer to bowl and place in large bowl of ice and water to chill,  stirring frequently, for 10 to 15 minutes or until cold and slightly  thickened. Remove from iced water.    Whip cream; set aside.  In large bowl, beat egg whites with salt until  stiff peaks form. Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten egg whites into  cooled asparagus mixture; fold into remaining whites along with whipped  cream. Pour into rinsed 6-cup mould. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6  hours or up to 2 days.    To unmould, wrap hot damp tea towel around mould for 1 minute.  Using  knife, loosen top edge of mousse from mould. Tilt or gently shake mould= to  loosen mousse. Invert rinsed serving platter on top of mould. Grasp platter  and mould; quickly turn over. Shake using quick downward motion, to release  mousse from mould.  Lift off mould.  (If mousse sticks, repeat the  procedure.)
