Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing - Lowfat
Dijon mustard, Tomato juice, Sugar, Pepper; to taste, olive oil, Balsamic vinegar, Salt; optional, 
I was reading todays Food section in the Boston Globe (5/4/94), and  thought of all of you on this list who are always looking for a good recipe  for low fat salad dressing.    Tomato juice replaces most of the oil in this reduced-fat recipe.       In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk ingredients until evenly  blended. Makes about 2/3 cup.    >From: MLAPLANT.OFS@sph.harvard.edu (Laplante, Michelle)  <eat-lf-request@list.best.com>  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v096.n127    Date: Mon, 19 Aug 1996 08:50:38 -0500    From: matejka@bga.com (Anita A.
