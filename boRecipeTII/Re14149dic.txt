White Fontina Pizza
Fresh; minced garlic, Fontina Cheese; thinly, Salt, Egg yolks; lightly beaten, Dry white wine, Grated Parmesan, Pizza Dough, 
This is from the Williams Sonoma Pizza Cookbook. I was wrong-- it doesnt  have any oil in it. Enjoy!    Make the dough. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. If using pizza stone or  baking tiles, put them in the oven now.    Combine Fontina and wine in a heat-proof bowl. Place bowl in a saucepan  half filled with water to form a bain marie. Once cheese is melted, add  Parmesan and egg yolks, then stir until mixture is creamy and thickens,  about 5 minutes. Do not allow mixture to boil.    Remove from heat and season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic.    Shape pizza dough into one large round or smaller hor dovre size rounds.  Spoon Fontina mixture evenly over dough.    Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F and bake  until crust is golden, about 10 minutes.    Serves 4, or more as hor dovres.
