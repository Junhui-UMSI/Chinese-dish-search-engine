Heat until  sides pull away (if edge of batter sticks to sides of pan,    gently pull away with a knife. Turn crepe out onto a damp dish towel and  return pan to stove to heat again Brush margarine in    pan and swirl another 1/4 cup of batter and pour off excess Repeat with  remaining batter. slightly overlap crepes on towels to    cool.  To assemble blintzes: Place one tablespoon of filling on one edge of crepe;  roll forward twice, then fold both sides and continue rolling to end. (  blintzes can be frozen at this point.) Fry blintzes, both sides, in butter  until golden brown. Serve with one or all    of the following: sour cream , applesauce, cinnamon, fresh or frozen  strawberries, jam honey or syrup.  Makes 15 to 20 cheese filled blintzes depending on thickness of crepe.
