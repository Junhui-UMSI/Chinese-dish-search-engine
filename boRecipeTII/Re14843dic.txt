Line a pie pan with pie dough. Mix the sugar, flour, lemon rind, allspice,  and salt together. Sprinkle just a little of this at the bottom of the pie  shell. Affange the tomato slices, a layer at a time, as you cover each  layer with the sugar mixture, lemon juice, and a dot of butter on each  slice. Keep layering until you reach the top of the pie tin.
