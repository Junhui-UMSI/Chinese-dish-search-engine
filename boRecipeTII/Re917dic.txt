Hot Mashed Potatoes
Russet potatoes; (russetts, Garlic cloves peeled and, Onion, milk, Butter or margarine, Good sized Jalapeno; chopped, 
Here is a mashed potato recipe that we have done for quite awhile...we love  it and if there are left overs, I add flour, and turn the leftover mashed  potato into a different lefsa, or if yer Irish, potato cakes.    Peel and cut into chunks the potatoes, and just cover with cold water, add  a LITTLE salt and bring to a boil, add the garlic, the chopped onion, the  chopped pepper. and turn down heat, simmer until potatoes are done...drain  water, save this for soup stock! and mash the potatoes, adding the milk,  butter, and the chile powder...adjust the milk, or, and butter(or marg) so  that the ensuing potato mixture is correct. Serve with whatever you would  serve ordinary mashed potatos with....BEWARE! THESE AINT!! Cheers, Doug in  BC    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by Walt Gray <waltgray@mnsinc.com> on Dec 06,  1998,
