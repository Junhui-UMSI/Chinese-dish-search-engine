This is another recipe sent to me in a flyer trying to get me to buy a  Pillsbury cookbook.    Adapted from several apple pie recipes, this elegant tart is a delicious  contemporary variation.    Prepare pie crust according to package directions for two-crust pie using  10-inch tart pan with removable bottom or 9-inch pie pan. Place 1 prepared  crust in pan; press in bottom and up sides of pan. Trim edges if necessary.    Heat oven to 400 F. Place cookie sheet in oven to preheat. In large bowl,  combine apples, sugar, raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, lemon peel and 2  teaspoons lemon juice; toss lightly to coat. Spoon into crust-lined pan.    To make lattice top, cut second crust into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange  strips in lattice design over filling. Trim and seal edges. In small bowl,  combine egg yolk and water; gently brush over lattice.    Place tart on preheated cookie sheet. Bake at 400 F. for 40 to 60 minutes  or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust  with strips of foil after 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive  browning. Cool 1 hour.    In small bowl, combine glaze ingredients, adding enough lemon juice for  desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle over slightly warm tart. Cool;  remove sides of pan.
