Appalachian Cornbread
milk, Salt, Flour, Cornmeal; (preferably white), Egg, Oil; (Granny used melted, Baking Powder, Sugar, 
My Granny was a mountain woman from the heart of the Appalachians. She  cooked three huge meals a day, and she made corn bread every  day...sometimes twice a day. I formulated this recipe from watching her  make bread. She never measured anything, so one time I made her stop and  let me measure what she was doing. I then cut that amount in half.    She baked her cornbread in a big cast-iron skillet in a wood stove. Heres  my adaptation of what Granny made....    Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Put about 1 teaspoon bacon drippings in an 8x8  pan, and put it into the oven to heat.    In medium bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  stir in remaining ingredients, beating by hand JUST until smooth. Batter  will still be lumpy.    Pour into hot, prepared pan. Bake for 18-22 minutes, or until done in  center. Immediately remove from pan, and cool a little. Cut into nine  squares.    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H.
