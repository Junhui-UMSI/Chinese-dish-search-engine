Beef Stew, President Ronald Reagans Favorite
Burgundy wine, Mushrooms (drained), Salt, Vegetable oil, Butter, Garlic, split, (8 oz) refrigerated biscuits, Frozen artichoke hearts, Flour, Beef consomme, Large onions, sliced, Dill weed, Lean beef stew meat, Grated Parmesan cheese, 
Heat oil.  Saute garlic and onions.  Remove. Mix flour, salt, pepper.  Dredge meat and brown well. Return onion to pot. Add dill weed, wine, and  consomme. Cover tightly and simmer about 2 hours or until meat is tender.  Cook artichokes 1 minute less than package directions. Add to meat. Add  mushrooms.  Mix gently. Taste for seasoning. Pour into 2 1/2 quart  casserole. Crown with biscuits (brush with butter and parmesan cheese).  Bake 15 to 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Note: I usually cook the stew in the  pot, add canned artichokes (not marinated) with the mushrooms, simmer until  the mushrooms are done, and serve with french bread. Eliminates the frozen  artichodes, canned biscuits, and baking.
