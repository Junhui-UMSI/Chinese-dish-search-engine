Tomato Red Relish
Salt, Finely shopped onion, Garlic powder, Chopped fresh basil, Ripe tomatoes; (up to 5), Sugar, White vinegar, 
Cut the tomatoes in half crosswise, then squeeze gently to remove the juice  and seeds; cut the tomatoes into cubes. Place the cubes in a medium-sized  bowl and add the remaining ingredients; mix well. Serve immediately, or  cover and chill until ready to use.    Note: I think this tastes best a room temperature, so, if I make it ahead  of time, I let it sit for just a few minutes before serving.
