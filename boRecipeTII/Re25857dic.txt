This came from one of the other cookbooks I picked up last weekend.  Nice segue, eh?    Inherited from Spain, this codfish dish is a favorite of the  Mexicans. Soak codfish for 8 hours in enough cold water to cover it.  Drain and shred the fish.  Saute the onion in the oil until it is  softened. Add codfish and saute a few more minutes.  Add the  remaining ingredients. Simmer slowly until codfish is tender, about      1/2    hour or more.    Makes 4 servings.    From "The Art of Mexican Cooking" by Jan Aaron and Sachs Salom.
