Clean hens well under cold water.  Pat dry.    In a large bowl, combine hens, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, vinegar, oil,  prunes, apricots, olives, capers (with juice) and bay leaves. Cover and  refrigerate overnight to marinate.    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Arrange game hens in 1 or 2 shallow  roasting pans. Spoon all the marinade over the hens. Sprinkle evenly with  brown sugar and pour wine around them. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, basting  frequently, until golden. Juice should look clear when thigh is pricked  with a fork. Transfer hens, fruit, olives and capers to a serving platter.  Moisten with pan juices and sprinkle with parsley. Pass remaining pan  juices in a sauce boat.    NOTES:    *  Cornish game hens stewed in fruit and sugar -- I originally got this  recipe from the Sunday magazine of the local paper. I served it last year  for Christmas dinner, and its very good. Whats more, this recipe is easy:  you just put everything in a bowl, marinate overnight, then bake until  done!    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 1 hour cooking.  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.    : Nancy Mintz  : UNIX System Development Lab, AT&T-IS, Summit, NJ  : ihnp4!attunix!nlm    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
