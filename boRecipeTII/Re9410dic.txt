Pumpin Flan
Ground nutmeg, (16-oz) pumpkin, Vanilla, (12-oz) evaporated milk, Ground cinnamon, Whipped (sweetened) cream, Sugar, Ground ginger, Eggs, Sugar, OPTIONAL TOPPINGS, Ground nutmeg, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 350F.    In a large, heavy skillet, cook the 1 cup sugar over medium-high heat till  sugar begins to melt; do not stir, just shake skillet occasionally. When  sugar starts to melt, reduce heat to low; continue cooking till sugar is  golden brown (and completely melted). Working *quickly*: - Pour sugar into  a 10",? deep?? pie plate or a 10" quiche dish. - TIlt to evenly coat  bottom. Set aside to cool.    In a large mixing bowl, stir together eggs, pumpkin, milk, the 1/3 cup  sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Pour pumpkin mixture  atop sugar in pie plate.    Place pie plate into a large roasting pan. Pour _boiling_ water into  roasting pan around pie plate to a depth of 1/2" to 1", i.e., about 1/2"  from the top of the pie plate, since you dont want to slosh water into the  flan. _Carefully_ put the roasting pan in the oven and bake for 55-55 min  for pie plate or 45-50 min for quiche dish, or till a knife inserted near  the center comes out clean. Cool. Chill, covered, for 4-24 hours.    To serve, loosen edges of flan with a knife, slipping point of knife down  sides of flan to let air in. Invert flan onto a serving platter. If  desired, top with whipped cream and nutmeg.    8-12 servings.
