Barbecue Sauce #20
Bottle (64-oz) ketchup, Liquid smoke (optional), Ground red pepper, Sugar, Black Pepper, Vinegar, Lemon juice, Salt, 
This is my grandmothers recipe for barbecue sauce.  I love it, which is  why I have the recipe.  Ive never eaten anything close from a bottled  variety.  Its very hot and tangy, although the "hot" can be toned down  according to taste.     Place all the ingredients in a saucepan.  Simmer on low heat until the  sauce is as thick as you want it.  2 Tbsp. liquid smoke can also be added  during the last 30 minutes or so if desired.
