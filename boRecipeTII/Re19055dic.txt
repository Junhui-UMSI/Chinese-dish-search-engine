Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a 11 x 9 x 2 pan with cooking spray.  Wrap  tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in oven for 7 to 10 minutes or until  softened.  Meanwhile, in a saucepan of boiling water, blanch zucchini for 2  minutes or until just tender.  Drain, rinse under cold water to stop the  cooking, and pat dry with paper towel.  In a large bowl, combine zucchini,  rice, onions, sour cream, 1/2 cheese, salt, and pepper.  Spoon 1/8 of the  filling onto each tortilla and spread it down the center.  Roll tortillas  to enclose filling and arrange, seam side down, in prepared pan.  Cover pan  with aluminum foil and bake the enchiladas for 10 minutes or until heated  through.  Meanwhile, prepare sauce. In a medium saucepan, heat oil over  moderate heat.  Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5  minutes or until softened.  Add garlic and chili power and cook, stirring  for 1 minute.  Add tomatoes and broth, simmer and stirring occasionally,  for 10 minutes or until sauce has thickened slightly.  Stir in coriander.  Spoon sauce over enchiladas, sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and  bake 8 to 10 minutes longer or until cheese has melted and the sauce is  bubbling.
