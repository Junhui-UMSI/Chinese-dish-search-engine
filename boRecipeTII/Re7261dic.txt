Pork Chop and Potato Cassarole
potatos, Cream of mushroom soup, Sour cream, Pork Chops, Water, 
Flour and brown porkchops. Layer potatoes & sour cream mix in pan until all  used up and the last layer is the sour cream mix. Place pork chops on top.  Bake at 350 for 1 hr. and 45 min. or until potatoes are done.    This is a family favorite and I have long since known where it came from!  It is very versatile.
