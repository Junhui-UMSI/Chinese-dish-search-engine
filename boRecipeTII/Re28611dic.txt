When the fire has burned down to hot coals, spread to provide moderate heat  and fit a drip pan in front of in the center of the coals. Place the  brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan. Cover the grill and adjust the  dampers to maintain slow steady heat. While the meat is cooking, in a sauce  pan combine all of the other ingredients, blending well, and simmer for 10  minutes. After 1 hour, baste the meat lightly with the sauce and turn the  meat as needed to cook evenly. Replenish the fire as needed, but dont pile  the coals, as the brisket should cook slowly. Cook 4 to 5 hours total until  the meat almost falls apart. Sprinkle 2 to 3 handfuls of hickory chips,  that have been soaked in water, over the coals. Cover the grill or enclose  the top of the meat in a sheet of foil, tucked around the bottom edges of  the meat and let the hickory smoke the meat for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove  the cover and brush the meat with the sauce. Place the meat on a platter  and slice.  It will crumble. Serve the meat and the remaining sauce on  split and buttered sandwich buns. Any leftover sandwiches can be frozen and  reheated in a Microwave or conventional oven, or the shredded meat and  sauce can be frozen together to reheat later for sandwiches.
