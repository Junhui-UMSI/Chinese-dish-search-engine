I make this in the crockpot, putting the beans in to soak the night before  and simmering all day. I rarely have exactly the beans called for, so end  up substituting most of the time. Ive used black beans (which turn the  other beans slightly purple, much to my daughters amusement), and navy  beans successfully, although they take a little longer to cook. This has a  spicy, smoky, barbeque- like flavor. I also rarely measure anything and  just add what looks right, especially spices in something like this. It  hasnt made any difference that I can detect! Its also good over rice.    Cover beans with water and soak overnight. Drain and discard soaking water.  Add all ingredients and simmer until beans are tender.  Posted to FOODWINE Digest 21 Feb 97 by Laurie Thompson  <llt@GWIS2.CIRC.GWU.EDU> on Feb 22, 1997.
