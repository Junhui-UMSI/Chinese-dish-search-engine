Mix ricotta, sugar and vanilla together and set aside. Combine the orange  liquor and honey, toss with the berries. Slice cake and then cut slices  into triangle pieces. Line the bottom of a 8-inch spring form pan and  sprinkle with rum. Line the sides with ladyfingers. Spread half of the  ricotta mixture  over the cake layer on bottom. Sprinkle with some berries.  Place another layer of cake down and sprinkle with orange juice and vodka  mixture, ricotta cream and some berries. The last layer should be a layer  of cake. Cover with whipped cream. Decorate with the reserved berries.  Chill over night.    Source: "The Yankee Kitchen" 03-18-93 (#4) [Dora]  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Wayne T.
