In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, yogurt and 1/4 cup pesto. Pour  dressing over potato mixture and toss gently to combine. Chill before  serving.     PESTO:  In food processor, place 1/4 cup nuts, 3 garlic cloves, 2 cups  packed fresh basil leaves and 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley; process until  finely ground. With motor running, gradually add 2/3 cup olive oil until  pesto is the consistency of mayonnaise. Add freshly ground pepper to taste.  Transfer to a small jar and pour a thin film of olive oil over surface of  pesto.  Cover tightly and store in refrigerator.
