How To Oven Dry Fruit
Plums, Peaches, Apricots, Plum cots, Figs, Seedless Grapes, Sugar, 
Each quantity below fills one baking pan. Any fruit to be dried should be  ripe but still firm. Store dried fruit in an airtight container, frozen, up  to six weeks; warm frozen fruit in a 200F oven until soft, 5 - 15 min.    Heat oven to 225F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Arrange fruit,  cut sides up, spaced 1/2 - 1" apart, on paper. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp sugar over  fruit; depending on fruits tartness, add more sugar.    Transfer pan to oven; dry until fruit has shriveled, edges have dried, and  centers are still juicy; timing will vary according to variety of fruit,  ripeness, and size, 1 1/2 - 4 hrs. If juices start to run, baste with  juices every hour. Transfer pan to a cooling rack; remove from pan while  still warm.
