The Rockettes Fudge Brownie Tart
Bittersweet chocolate,, All-purpose flour, Chocolate chips, Vanilla extract, walnuts, unsalted butter, Sugar, Salt, Unsweetened chocolate,, Eggs, Brown Sugar, Grand Marnier, 
Preheat the oven to 350  F. Butter and flour a 10-inch tart pan with a  removable bottom. In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, combine the  butter and the sugars. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter is  melted, 4 to 6 minutes. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the  bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and process until finely chopped, 15  to 20 seconds. Add the hot butter-sugar mixture and process for 15 more  seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Process  to combine, about 10 seconds. Add the flour, salt, walnuts, and Grand  Marnier. Pulse briefly 10 times, just to mix.    Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle the top with  chocolate chips. Bake 25 to 30 minutes; a toothpick inserted near the  center will come out moist. Do not overbake. Remove the sides of the pan  and cool on a wire rack. Cut into wedges and serve.
