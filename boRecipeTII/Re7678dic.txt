Pork with Balsamic Vinegar and Basil
Purple onions, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Unsalted butter, Chicken broth, Salt and pepper, Garlic, Pork scallopini, Flour, Balsamic vinegar, Basil leaves, 
Dredge the scallopine in the flour and shake off any excess. Melt the  butter with the olive oil in a wide pan over high heat. When it is bubbling  hot, add scallopine and cook until browned on one side, about 2 minutes;  turn.    Add the garlic, onion, salt and pepper; cook 1 minute. Deglaze with the  broth and let it reduce. Add the vinegar and cook until it reduces to a  glaze, about 1 minute. Stir basil into sauce and serve.
