OVEN: 350 degrees F    Coat a 9 X 11-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. (I used 2- 8  inch square pans so that I could freeze one kugel for later use.)    Cook noodles according to directions on the package. (I undercook  slightly.) Drain well; place in baking dish.    In food processor, mix eggs, egg substitute and sugar; process well. Add  sour cream, cottage cheese, yogurt, milk, vanilla and melted margarine;  process very well. (I let my processor run until the mixture is "whipped"  as my family does not like any "traces" of cottage cheese curds! <g>) Stir  in 1/2 of drained pineapple. Pour mixture into pan and combine well with  noodles.    TOPPING: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon, removing lumps. Sprinkle  reserved drained crushed pineapple over noodle mixture. Sprinkle brown  sugar- cinnamon mixture over the pineapple.    Bake 50 minutes or until set.    Freezes very well.
