Drain water chestnuts. Core and chop the  apple. Spray nonstick skillet with vegetable cooking spray; stir fry pork  strips until cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside; keep warm. In  large serving bowl, toss spinach, watercress, celery, grapes, green onion,  water chestnuts, and apples; toss to mix. In a small saucepan, combine  salad dressing, white wine, mustard, and brown sugar; heat just until brown  sugar is dissolved, stirring constantly. Stir cooked pork into hot dressing  to coat well. Remove pork; pour half of the dressing over greens mixture in  bowl; toss well. Place pork strips on top of salad. Sprinkle with sesame  seeds. Pass remaining dressing.
