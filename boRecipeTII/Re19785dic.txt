Boil remaining juice  with the sugar for 15 minutes to concentrate it. Mix the lemon and lime  juice, and add all but 1/4 cup cornstarch to dissolve it in the mixture.  Add both gelatin mixture and cornstarch mixture to the boiled juice and  boil again rapidly for 10 minutes until very thick, stirring constantly.  Taste for sweet and sour and add more lemon juice if wanted.    Mix in the walnuts and pour mixture into a 9-by-9-by-2-inch baking pan that  has been dipped in cold water.  Let paste harden 12 hours or overnight,  then cut with a sharp knife into squares. Mix together the reserved 1/4 cup  cornstarch and powdered sugar.  Remove squares with a spatula and roll each  in the powdered sugar mixture (the cornstarch helps keep the sugar dry).    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
