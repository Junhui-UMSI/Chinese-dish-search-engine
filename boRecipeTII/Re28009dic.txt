Baked Chicken Breasts with Cheese
margarine, Sliced Swiss cheese, Sherry, Cream of celery soup, Boneless; skinless chicken, (or more) croutons , 
1. Spray an oblong casserole baking dish with Pam. Arrange chicken pieces  in pan. Put cheese slices on top of chicken.    2. Mix soup with sherry; pour over cheese.    3. Sprinkle with croutons. Dot with margerine.    4. Bake, covered, in a preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Uncover for  the last 10 minutes of baking so croutons can get crisp. Serves 4.    This was great with Stove-Top Stuffing, skillet sweet potatoes, and  veggies. Laura Schetter...Ken will love this one!    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by "Sharon H.
