Poultry Seasoning
Dried sage, Dried savory, Powdered ginger, Use 1/8 tsp for 1 recipe amt, Dried thyme, Grated nutmeg, Use 1/2 tsp for 3 tb total, Dried marjoram, Ground allspice, Ground white pepper or less?, 
Combine all ingredients (or those of your choice) and store in an  airtight jar.  Yield about 3 tbsp.  (My note:  cautious with white  pepper! - my dressing tastes good with just 1/2 the quantity of sage  as the recipe amount of poultry seasoning and a generous grinding of  black pepper.)    Keep a note of the contents of your own poultry seasoning so you can  duplicate a good one next time you want it.
