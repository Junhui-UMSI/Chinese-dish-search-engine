To make pastry, put dry ingredients and lemon peel in bowl of food  processor fitted with metal chopping blade; process just to mix.  Add  butter and cut into small pieces; process just until mixture resembles  coarse meal.  Add egg yolk; process just until blended.  With processor  running, quickly add ice water.  Process several seconds until pastry  forms ball.  Stop at once to avoid overmixing.  Wrap ball in plastic wrap;  chill at least one hour.    Butter a 10-inch quiche pan with a removable bottom.  Roll pastry out  slightly larger than pan.  Carefully lift pastry to pan and gently press  against bottom and sides.  Trim edges; prick bottom and sides with fork.  Chill for 1/2 hour.    Line pastry-filled pan with a circle of foil, pressing it gently against  pastry.  Fill liner with uncooked rice or dried beans to weight.  Bake in  preheated 375 degree F oven 15 minutes.  Lift out liner with rice or beans  (save for future pastry baking). Bake crust 5 minutes longer; cool on  rack.    To make glaze, heat preserves and rum over low heat, stirring.  Strain,  brush tart shell with 2 tablespoons glaze.  Reserve remainder.    To make filling, stir together almonds, sugar, and flour; sprinkle over  glazed shell.  Slice 12 pear halves crosswise. (Do not separate the  slices. -KM)  Place sliced halves in circle over almond mixture in shell.  Chop remaining pear halves, use to fill spaces between sliced pears.    Bake in preheated 375 degree F oven 40 minutes.  Remove from oven, brush  with remaining warm glaze.    Serve at room temperature.
