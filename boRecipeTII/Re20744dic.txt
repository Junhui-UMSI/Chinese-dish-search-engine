Apple Dip
Brown Sugar, Vanilla, Sugar, 8 oz. Cream cheese, Nuts; chopped, 
Blend together sugars, vanilla and cream cheese. Stir in nuts. Cut up  apples into slices and soak for a few minutes in lightly salted water. This  will help prevent browning. Dip away!!!!!    NOTES : This came from an aunt who never measures anything and I have  adapted it. This is a real stand out as a fruit dip. I make it with fat  free cream cheese and Grape Nuts (instead of nuts) for a lower fat version.  Recipe by: Joy Sebastian Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #671 by "Joy H.
