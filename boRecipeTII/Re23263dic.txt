Spoon half the pasta mixture into a  large oven-proof dish. Spread half the tuna and tomatoes over the top.  Cover with the remaining pasta mixture, tuna and tomatoes. Roll out the  pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 10 inch square. Mix together the  anchovies and puree and spread over the pastry to within 1 inch. Dampen the  pastry edges, roll up like a swiss roll and cut into 16 rounds using a  small sharp knife. Place on a baking sheet amd press down to flatten  slightly.
