Sweet Potato Casserole
Brown sugar, Shredded coconut, Eggs, Sweet potatoes; or 60 oz., Vanilla, Flour, Sugar, Pecans, Sticks butter; melted,, 
Well, now that weve tried the Sweet Potato Casserole, and sent in the  recipe, this mornings newspaper informs me that the recipe was incorrect.  It should have 2 1/2 STICKS of butter - not cups. We did think it was kind  of wet but tasty. Ill try it again at Christmas with the correct recipe.  The corrected recipe is as follows:    Lightly rub a 9x13 inch casserole with butter. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  In large mixing bowl, mash sweet potatoes. Add 1 1/2 sticks butter, sugar,  eggs and vanilla. Beat until smooth. Pour into casserole. Mix coconut,  brown sugar, remainig butter, pecans and flour to make topping. Spread over  sweet potatoes and bake 20-30 minutes or until topping is brown. Makes 12  servings.    Since I am sending in a correction, thought Id send another recipe for the  holidays. This is similar to the chex mix people make, but I think it is  much better. A friend of my mothers (now deceased) gave this to us over 40  years ago. The size boxes of cereal it calls for no longer exist so you  will need to guess or weigh the cereal. This is great to serve guests or  just for family snacking. Connie    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by CGarlitz@aol.com on Nov 29, 1997
