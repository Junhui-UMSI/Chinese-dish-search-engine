Vegetable Quinoa Bake with Red Kuri Squash
White wine or veggie stock, Zucchini, Pumpkin, Onion, Salt, Pepper, kale, red kuri, Water, mushrooms, Bell pepper, Fresh parsley, Garlic, Salt veggie broth, Jalapeno pepper, Quinoa, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Saute with wine or broth  the onion, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, and garlic  for about 5 minutes. Stir in rest of ingredients and  bring to a boil. (I did NOT stir in the greens,  instead I placed them in the bottom of the dish  first.) Transfer mixture to a 9x13 casserole dish and  cover. Bake until liquid is absorbed, about 35 to 40  minutes. Remove from oven and fluff with a fork. Let  stand 5 minutes before serving.  Makes 6-8 servings  (acc. to VT... for me its 4 servings if its the main  dish).
