Pour the water into the pan and add the butter.  Break eggs into pan,and  measure in the ricotta cheese, vanilla extract, flour, sugar, salt,and  yeast. Set the machine to the quick cycle for this bread, and add the  cherries at the beep or after the first kneading.    When the bread is served piping hot from its pan, the cherries are still  moist inside, reminding one of a fresh cherry pie.  Slices are delectable  spread with cream cheese, and if youre one of those who cant stay away  from the cherry jar, you can always sneak some more of them into the cream  cheese too.
