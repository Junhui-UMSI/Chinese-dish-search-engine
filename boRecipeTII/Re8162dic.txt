Potato Crusted Chicken with Olives and Red Wine
Dry red wine, Chicken Stock, Fried spinach leaves, shallots, Russet potatoes, Unsalted butter, salt and pepper, Greek Calamata, basil, olive oil, Skinless boneless chicken, 
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees. Wash and peel the potatoes. Fill a bowl  with cold water and slice the potatoes into paper thin slices on an Asian  vegetable slicer or on the wide slicer of a cheese grater. Put the cut  potato into the ice water and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon each of oil and  butter in a large saute pan. Season the chicken breasts with salt and  pepper and add to the hot pan. Brown the chicken to a light golden color  over moderately high heat. Turn the chicken to brown the second side, then  remove the breasts from the pan, place in an oven proof dish and set aside.  Add the shallots to the hot pan and saute for 1 minute. Stir the olives  into the shallots, add the wine, and cook for 1 minute before adding the  chicken stock. Cook for 1 minute and then turn off the heat. Drain the  potatoes and dry on paper towels. Toss the potatoes in a bowl, with the  remaining olive oil, making sure they are evenly coated, and season with  salt and pepper. Wrap each chicken breast completely in sliced potato.  Overlap the slices across the width of the chicken. Place the potato  wrapped chicken into the oven and roast for 12 to 14 minutes or until the  potato has cooked to a crisp golden brown and the chicken is fully cooked  but still moist. As the chicken finishes cooking, reheat the sauce, cook  for 6 to 7 minutes then add the basil. Swirl in the remaining butter and  spoon around the chicken. Serve with fried spinach leaves.
