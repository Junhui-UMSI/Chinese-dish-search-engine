Daal refers to a variety of lentils, peas and beans that are used to make  soups and stews also known as daal. This recipe calls for toor daal,  split yellow pigeon peas, but you can substitute mung beans or red lentils.  Vaghar, the method used here to saute spices in oil is a basic Gujarati  cooking technique used in making most dishes.    DIRECTIONS: =========== Cover daal with water and soak 30 minutes. If using  a pressure cooker, reduce soaking time to 10 minutes. Discard soaking water  in a large saucepan or pressure cooker. Cook 50 minutes by conventional  method or 15 minutes in a pressure cooker. If using red lentils, cook 30  minutes by conventional method or 10 minutes in pressure cooker. For a  souplike consistency, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more water if needed. Puree daal  with a handheld electric blender or in a food processor.    Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add cumin seeds and  asafetida.  Cook until cumin seeds turn golden brown, about 1 minute. Add  to the daal and bring to a boil.    Stir in chilies, salt, sugar, turmeric and tomatoes. Lower heat and simmer  uncovered 5 minutes.  Remove daal from heat. Stir in cilantro and yogurt or  lemon juice and serve immediately.
