Baked Onions with Sour Cream
Lemon juice, Brown sugar, Black Pepper, (1/2 stick) butter,, Bermuda or Vidalia onions,, Finely minced fresh parsley, Sour cream, room temperature, Salt, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees (F).  Place the unpeeled onions in a  foil-lined shallow pan.  Bake, uncovered, for 1-1/2 hours.  Warm a  heatproof shallow serving dish.  When onions are tender, remove from  oven.  Spear each with a fork, snip or cut off both ends, and remove  skin.  Place the peeled onions in the warmed dish.  Immediately add the  butter and sour cream so they will melt from the heat of the onions.  Then add the rest of the ingredients and toss lightly to mix. [Note:  these will hold nicely in a warm oven for 1/2 - 1 hour.]    If you cant make this with real butter and sour cream, it really isnt  worth making.  When you do, this is absolute heaven!    from Cooking from Quilt Country, by Marcia Adams, 1989  ISBN 0-517-56813-6  Collection of recipes from "Great Sysops of the World" from COOKFDN ops.
