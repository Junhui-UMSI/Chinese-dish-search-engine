Amaretto Custard Cake
Yellow cake mix, Eggs, Amaretto, Instant pudding mix, milk, Nutmeg, 
Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 12 cup bundt or angel food cake  pan.    Beat all ingredients in a large bowl on low speed, scraping bowl  constantly, 1 minute. Beat on medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally, for        2    more minutes.    Pour into prepared pan and bake 40-45 minutes, until a wooden pick comes  out clean.    Cool 15 minutes before removing from pan.  Decorate with frosting, or make  a glaze of 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp milk or cream, liqueur to  thin.    Id say that you could use a chocolate cake mix, kahlua or baileys instead  of amaretto, then melt a half cup of chocolate chips, 2-3 Tbsp butter and  maybe a bit of milk or cream, as needed to thin, and drizzle that over the  top, and itd look like you spent hours in the kitchen. I >know< that this  recipe tastes good enough that you need super sensitive taste buds to know  it started with a mix. Dont ruin it with a commercial frosting, though.  Theres absolutely no possible way to disguise >that< flavor.    Recipe By: Antoinette Hartman Serving Size: 12    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.
