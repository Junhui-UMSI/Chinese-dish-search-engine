Ive also sprinkled it over pasta, sort of like parmesan  cheese, when Ive been too lazy to make it into a proper sauce. The  following recipe for a cheesy sauce is from Lifelines magazine, the  newsletter of the Toronto Vegetarian Association. This recipe makes a lot;  I usually quarter the amounts.    Mix dry ingredients in a small saucepan or heat-proof bowl and whisk in  water or stock. Beat well to remove lumps. Cook over a low heat, stirring  constantly, until sauce thickens. Remove from heat and stir in oil and  mustard. The sauce will thicken further as it cools, but can be thinned  later with more water or stock. Great over pasta, broccoli, in casseroles,  etc.    fatfree digest V96 #203    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
