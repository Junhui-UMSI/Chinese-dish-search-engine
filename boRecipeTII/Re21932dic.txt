Simply cut the fruit in half (or  in quarters), place it in a 2 or 3 quart microwaveable corningware  casserole, cover it, and microwave on high for 12 to 15 minutes. You might  want to check for doneness periodically. When the apples are soft, let cool  a bit, and then force through a ricer into a bowl. Sweeten to taste,  depending on the apple variety, and season to taste with cinnamon, nutmeg,  ginger, and/or allspice. This freezes well in jam jars or plastic  containers.
