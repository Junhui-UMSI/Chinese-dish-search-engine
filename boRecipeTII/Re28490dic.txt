Terrine of Potatoes and Tuna
4-cup loaf pan or a terrine;, Salt, Mayonnaise, Capers, Black Pepper, (6 1/4 oz) tuna; packed in, Russet potatoes; peeled and, Red bell pepper, Hot milk, 
In a saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold salted water and bring to a  boil. Partially cover and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and  mash the potatoes with an old-fashioned masher, ricer, or through a  strainer. Beat in the hot milk. Season with salt and pepper.    Char the red pepper over a burner. Put it in a plastic bag and set aside to  cool. Then peel and cut into 1/4-inch cubes. Set aside.    Drain the tuna and process for 1 minutes in the food processor.    Combine the mashed potatoes, tuna, and mayonnaise. Mix thoroughly. Fold in  the red pepper. Taste and correct seasonings.    Put the mixture in the prepared mold and refrigerate until cold or  overnight.    Decorate the top with capers. Serve with more capers, gherkins, and olives  on the side.    NOTE: Try this for summer picnics, informal buffets, lunch, cocktails, or  as a filling for sandwiches. Its absolutely delicious and easy to make!  The word terrine applies to both the dish and its contents. The terrine is  served in the dish, without unmolding. There are pretty porcelain, terra  cotta, and enameled cast-iron terrrines on the market, but it is not  necessary to own one to make this dish--a glass loaf pan works fine. This  terrine is looser in texture than a country pate. It will be easier to  scoop out the terrine with a spoon rather than trying to cut it in slices.
