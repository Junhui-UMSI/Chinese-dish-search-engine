Remove the crusts from the bread and discard. Tear the bread into small  pieces and place in a large bowl. Pour the milk over and leave to soak.    Meanwhile, cook the rice in boiling salted water for about 12 minutes until  tender. Drain well.    Beat the eggs and 2 tb olive oil into the bread mixture with about a  quarter of the cheese and the garlic, if using. Season with salt and  pepper.    Carefully fold the courgettes and rice into the milk and bread mixture and  pour into a greased gratin dish. Sprinkle with the remaining gruyere cheese  and a little parmesan, if using. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil.    Bake in the oven at 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 for 35-40 minutes or until golden  brown and firm to the touch. Leave to cool in the dish for 10 minutes  before serving.    Source: Sunday Mirror Magazine
