Makes about 6 cups. Slice vegetables into 1/16 inch thick slices.    Blanch each vegetable (except the plantain) separately in boiling water for  1 minute. Transfer to paper towels and pat dry. Keep the vegetables  separated after blanching.    Lightly coat a micro-wave safe plate with cooking spray. Arrange sweet  potato slices, without overlapping, on the plate and season with salt.  Microwave high for 5 minutes. Turn the slices and cook about 2 more minutes  until crisp. Let cool then transfer to a bowl. Repeat with each vegetable  separately, spray with cooking spray between each batch.    Arrange the plantain slices on the sprayed plate and microwave about 6  minutes, or until beginning to brown. Let cool, if not quite crisp  microwave another minute or two.    The chips can be stored in an airtight container about a week. Recrisp in a  250 F. oven.
