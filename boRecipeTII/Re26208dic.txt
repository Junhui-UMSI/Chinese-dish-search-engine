Toms Double Barrell Habanero Hot Sauces
Canola oil, Carrots, Onions, Garlic, Fresh lime juice, Vinegar, Habaneros, 
Saute the onion and garlic in the oil until soft.  Add the carrots with a  small amount of water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until  the carrots are soft.    Place the chiles, vinegar and lime juice in a blender and blend until  peppers are finely minced. Add the onion, garlic and carrots and puree the  mixture until smooth.    Return the mixture to the stove and simmer for 5 minutes.    Strain the mixture into an empty hot sauce bottle.  You get about 4 ounces.  This is a fiery hot sauce that you need to use with care.    Place the ingredients that were strained out into a jar and refrigerate. It  will have the consistency of finely grated horseradish but the flavor of  habanero fruit.  I love this on just about everything.    Tom Greaves  Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #138    Date: Tue, 22 Oct 96 09:51 EST    From: Tom Greaves <0007168628@mcimail.com>
