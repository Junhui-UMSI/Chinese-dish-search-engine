Make several crosswise slits on the underside of shrimp to prevent  curling.  Parboil green beans.  Pat shrimp and vegetables dry; arrange on  platter; cover and refridgerate until serving time. Prepare batter and  sauce recipes.  Do not make batter recipe too far ahead of time.       Heat oil in a wok to 360 degrees.  Dep shrimp and vegetables into  batter with tongs; allow excess batter to drip into bowl. Fry a few pieces  at a time until golden brown, turning once (cooking time approximately 2-3  minutes).     This is best prepared close to or at the table. It is great  fun to have a "tempura party" with guests cooking their own. Serve with  sauce and rice. (you may need more batter mix depending on the amounts of  seafood and vegetables you prepare).  Does not keep well once cooked.   04/02 06:18 am      Dorie (Waialua, Hawaii)..............
