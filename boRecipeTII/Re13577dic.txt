Wild Blueberry Cookies
Blueberries, wild, Salt, Lemon rind, Shortening, Egg, Flour, Milk, Baking Powder, Sugar, 
Combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Stir in blueberries. Do not thaw if  using frozen berries.    Cream shortening until soft, gradually beat in sugar then lemon rind and  egg.    Add flour mixture alternately with milk, beating until smooth after each  addition.  (Frozen blueberries could be folded in quickly at the end - the  dough turns purple as they thaw.) Drop from teaspoon onto greased cookie  sheet.    Bake at 375 F for 10-12 min or until lightly browned.    Source was a library book of native and country recipes. Shared by  Elizabeth Rodier June 93.
