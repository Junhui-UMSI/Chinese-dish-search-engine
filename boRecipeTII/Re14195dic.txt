White stock is generally used as a base for delicately flavored sauces.  This stock adds little or no color to the final sauce.    Place the bones and water in a large stock kettle. Bring to a boil and skim  well.  Add the remaining ingredients, turn the heat down to low, and simmer  for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Strain through a cheesecloth lined strainer and allow  to cool; then skim off the fat, and chill. The cold stock will be quite  gelatinous.    Yield:  About 6 cups.
