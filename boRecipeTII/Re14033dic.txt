Reduce heat so water barely simmers and cook until chocolate is  melted, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. Using electric mixer, beat  eggs in medium bowl to blend. Add sugar and beat until dissolved.  Slowly  mix in chocolate mixture. Beat in cream. Refrigerate until well chilled.    Process chocolate mixture in ice cream maker according to manufacturers  instructions. Freeze in covered container at least 4 hours to mellow. If  frozen solid, let ice cream soften slightly in refrigerator before serving.  Makes about 2 quarts.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.
