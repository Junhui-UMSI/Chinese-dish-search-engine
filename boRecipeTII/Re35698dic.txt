Recipe by: Cheryl Mainard <cmainard@ARTIC.EDU> Cook vegetables and garlic  in the oil with the salt and cumin until soft. Let cool slightly, then mix  in oregano.    Roll out bread dough on a greased baking sheet into a rectangle about 15-  by 11-inches.  Spread the vegetables and cheese down the middle of the  dough.  Cut dough (using kitchen shears) on opposite sides in diagonal  1-inch strips.  Fold in the ends, then fold the strips toward the center,  alternating sides for a braided effect.  Cover with a towel and let rise  about 30 minutes.    Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Brush loaf with egg glaze.  Bake until golden,  about 30 minutes.    NOTE:  This bread can be made 2 days in advance and served reheated or room  temperature    Recipes sent to me from Bill, wight@odc.net
