Beef Tips in Red Wine Sauce
Cubed beef sirloin, olive oil, Yellow onion, Mushrooms, garlic, Flour, Dried thyme leaves, Black Pepper, Nutmeg, Dry Red Wine, Beef broth, egg noodles, Chopped fresh parsley, 
Brown beef cubes in the olive oil in a 12 inch nonstick skillet set over  medium heat. Turn the cubes frequently to ensure even browning on all  sides. Add the onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until the onions  are fragrant. Add the mushrooms and garlic and reduce heat to medium low;  cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes longer, or until mushrooms  are brown.    Combine the flour, thyme leaves, black pepper and nutmeg in a small dish.  Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over the meat and mushroom mixture,  stirring well. Allow the flour mixture to "toast" in the pan without  burning for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then, stir in the red wine and beef  broth. Stir until the liquid comes to a boil and thickens very slightly.  Reduce heat to low, cover loosely, and simmer for 20 minutes. The sauce  will continue to thicken as water evaporates during cooking. If the sauce  becomes too thick, add a few tablespoons of water or beef broth.    While the meat is cooking, cook the noodles according to package  directions. When tender, stir the noodles and parsley into the beef mixture and heat through.
