Marinate the chicken pieces in  the sauce for 2-3 hours. Lay the chicken pieces in a pan and pour the sauce  over them. Bake at a high temperature for 10 minutes, then lower the  temperature to medium heat and bake for an additional 40 minutes or until  brown.    I baked this first at 225 C then lowered the temperature to 180 C.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Lenore Gould <lenoreg@wwnet.com> on Oct 08,  1998,
