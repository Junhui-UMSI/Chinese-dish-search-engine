1. Heat oven to 375. Set a 4 1/2-by-14-inch bottomless tart form on a  parchment-lined baking sheet. Roll out pastry to 1/8 inch thick, it should  be about 3 inches longer and wider than tart form. Roll pastry onto pin and  unroll over form; let extra dough hand over the edge. Fit dough into form.    2. Crumble almond paste evenly over pastry and sprinkle flour evenly on  top. Neatly overlap sliced plums in a fish-scale pattern on top of flour  and sprinkle with sugar. Fold sides of pastry over plums and tear to create  a 1-inch free-form edge. Chill for 10 to 15 minutes. Brush pastry with egg  wash. Bake until crust is golden brown and fruit is bubbling, about 35  minutes.    3. Meanwhile, heat jam and 2 T water in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Remove from heat and strain if necessary, discarding fruit solids. Brush  warm glaze over fruit. Cool slightly, remove tart form, and serve.
