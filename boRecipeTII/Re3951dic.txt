Mix all ingredients in large mixing bowl to smooth batter, add each  ingredient just as listed. Pour into greased and floured 9" bread loaf pan,  not pyrex, and bake for 80 minutes at 375 F. After an hour of baking,  loosely cover top of bread with foil to keep from overbrowning. As soon as  bread is out of oven, wipe top crust with 1 tablespoon soft margarine or  butter. Cool 1 hour. Cut into 1/2" slices. Dry on cookie sheets in single  layer in 200 F. oven, turning slices often, until bread is brittle enough  to crumble.    To Use Stuffing Bread:  Use in any recipe calling for dry herb-seasoned  stuffing mix. Or: Mix 8 cups of stuffing with 1 envelope dry onion soup  mix, 1 cup raisins and 1 cup chopped walnuts. Add 1 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup  butter or margarine, melted and 1/2 cup chicken broth or water. Bake in a  greased 2 qt. baking dish, covered for about 30 minutes. OR: Combine 1  recipe of the bread, with 21 oz. can apple pie filling, 2 well beaten eggs  and a 10 oz. can cream of celery soup. Spread in well greased 9x12x2"  baking dish. Spray one side of a sheet of foil with Pam and place, Pam-side  down, on mixture, sealing edges. Bake at 375 F. about 30-35 minutes. Cool  about 10 minutes before cutting into squares to serve with meat or poultry.  Will serve 6-8 adequately. Leftovers freeze well up to 6 months. Or: Brown  1 pound bulk sausage in a skillet, crumbling well, until well cooked. Stir  sausage and drippings into the stuffing mixture before baking it or you may  also add 1 cup diced celery or peeled/chopped apple to the stuffing mixture  before baking.
