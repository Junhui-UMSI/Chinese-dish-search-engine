submitted by: lindam@agt.net  This is a classic favorite for garlic lovers - Lo-fat too!    Line two seives with cheesecloth. Peel & finely chop the English cucumber.  (could use a food processor) Squeeze out the fluid with your hands & place  in one of the cheesecloth-lined seives to drain completely. Place the  yogurt in the other cheesecloth-lined seive & drain for 2 to 4 hours.  Combine drained yogurt, cucumber, crushed garlic & mint. Mix well.  Refrigerate for 1 hour prior to serving.    Serve as an appetizer with pita bread chunks or on burgers or donairs.
