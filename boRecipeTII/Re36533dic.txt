Strawberries with Brown Sugar
See Below, 
Enough strawberries to go around*** Fat-Free Sour Cream or Plain  Yogurt (or Soy Yogurt, for the dairy averse)*** "Brownulated" Brown  Sugar (brown sugar that is granulated)***    Rinse and dry the strawberries. Do not cap the berries, but serve them  intact. Put the fat-free sour cream and brown sugar in small bowls for  dipping. You can give a sour cream/brown sugar set to each person,  or, if youre being informal, let people share. Dip berries first  into sour cream, then into brown sugar, then into mouth. This may  sound a bit weird, but it is wonderful!    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
