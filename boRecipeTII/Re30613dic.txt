NOTES : A few years ago I worked at Washington University with a group of  vegetarian students who traded their favorite recipes. My family and  friends enjoyed this particular dish so much that I still take it to lunch  parties and serve it at home with some pita bread. -- Annette S. Liebman,  St. Louis, Missouri.
