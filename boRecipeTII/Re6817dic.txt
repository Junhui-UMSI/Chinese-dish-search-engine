submitted by: bohemia@felix.TECLink.Net (Aimee Lee, Jackson, Mississippi,  USA)  A friend of mine who knows of my great love for Italian cuisine got this  recipe for me from Compuserve. I made this for Christmas dinner and  received rave reviews.:) (makes 2 servings, but I usually double the  recipe)    Rub the salt, pepper, oregano, and basil into the chicken breasts and let  them sit for 15 minutes. Heat the oil in a saute pan at medium. Saute the  chicken until it is cooked through (10-15 minutes depending on the stove;  to check for doneness make an unobstrusive cut on the thickest part of  breast to make sure it is no longer pink). Add the remaining ingredients,  except the Parmesan. Simmer 10 minutes or until the sauce has thickened.  Remove from heat and serve on a bed of linguine. Garnish with the Parmesan.
