In a medium-size bowl, soak almonds  and raisins in 2 tablespoons of bourbon and set aside. Scald milk (heat  until bubbles form at edges) and set aside. Combine sugar, cornstarch,  flour and salt in top of a double boiler over simmering water on  medium-high heat; whisk in scalded milk, stirring well. Reduce heat, cover  pan and cook for 15 minutes, stirring often. Beat egg yolks and egg whites  in separate bowls with clean beaters. Remove pan from heat and pour a  little of the milk mixture over the egg yolks. Mix well then return egg  mixture to pan. Cook for 2 minutes longer, whisking constantly until  smooth. Whisk in vanilla and remaining 1/2 cup of bourbon. Fold in beaten  egg whites. Pour one-third of the custard over ladyfingers in bowl.  Sprinkle with one-third of the almond/raisin mixture, then add a layer of  ladyfingers on top. Repeat layers until bowl is almost full, finishing with  a layer of lady fingers. Garnish as desired.
