Place chicken in a shallow baking tray.     Arrange potatoes around chicken pieces. Scatter whole peeled cloves of  garlic around chicken and potatoes.     Mix together lemon juice and olive oil, and pour evenly over chicken and  potatoes.     Add water until potatoes are just about covered. Add salt, pepper to  taste.  Cover chicken and potatoes with generous amounts of oregano.     Bake at 350?F, (400?F for high altitude!) until tops of chicken are  reddish brown.     Turn chicken, stir potatoes, and sprinkle on more oregano. If potatoes  arent at least half- covered with liquid, add water.     Return to oven for about 15-20 minutes.  Chicken is done when both sides  are lightly browned and potatoes are soft when touched with a fork.    Serve with a crusty bread, or with pita bread.
