In a medium saucepan, boil the rice in 4 cups of water for 25 minutes, or  until just tender. Drain through a sieve and rinse with cold water to wash  off the starch and cool the rice. Spread the rice in a flat metal pan and  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.    This is a dish that cooks quite quickly from this point on, so its  important to have all the ingredients prepared and ready at hand.    Remove the tough outside layer of the lemongrass and cut off the root end  and the dry top. Start slicing from the root end and use only the most  tender, bulb-like part of the stalk. Slice thinly and chop very fine so the  flavor will be spread throughout. You should have about      1/4    cup, chopped.    Warm the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Saute the  lemongrass, chiles, and garlic for 30 seconds to release the aromatic oils.  Add the red pepper, celery, and ginger and stir-fry for another       30    seconds.    Add the chilled rice and cook until heated through, stirring occasionally  to keep it form sticking. Add the pineapple, mint, and cilantro to the hot  rice. Sprinkle the fish sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil over the top.  (Vegetarian Option: Substitute tamari for the fish sauce.) Stir to mix and  serve immediately.    Garnish with sprigs of mint and cilantro.
