Peanutty Rocky Road
Unsalted roasted peanuts, Large marshmallows;, Milk chocolate; coasrsely, 
In a heatproof bowl over hot, not simmering water, heat the chocolate till  almost completely melted. Remove from the water and let stand, stirring  occasionally, until the residual heat melts the chocolate completely. Let  the chocolate cool until tepid. Lightly butter a baking sheet. Stir the  marshmallows and peanuts into the tepid chocolate. (Stir a marshmallow into  the chocolate as a temperature test. If it melts, the chocolate is still  too warm; cool longer. If the chocolate stiffens, heat over hot water until  the chocolate is softened.) Spread onto the prepared baking sheet.  Refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours. Cut into pieces. (Store the rocky  road at room temperature in an airtight container.) Makes about 1-3/4  pounds. Source: "An Edible Christmas" Cookbook by Irena Chalmers.
