Peanut Butter and Jelly Bread
Peanut butter, All-purpose flour, Sugar, Baking Powder, Salt, Egg, milk, Stawberry or raspberry, 
Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking  powder, and salt. Cut in the peanut butter with an electric beater on  medium speed, until well combined. Add the egg and milk; stir until well  blended. Spread half the batter into a 9" x 5" loaf pan that has been  coated with nonstick cooking spray and spoon the preserves down the center  of the batter. Top with the remaing batter, covering the preserves  completely. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted  in the center comes out clean. Invert onto a wire rack and let cool  completely. Slice and serve.    Recipe by: MR FOOD    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1041 by Meg Antczak  <meginny@frontiernet.net> on Jan 24, 1998
