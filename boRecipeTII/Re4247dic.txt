Perfect Steamed Rice (Mf)
Water, Converted rice, Butter, optional, Salt, Thin strips of blackforest, 
Place rice, water and salt in a saucepan. Bring liquid to a boil over  medium heat. Cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is as tender as  you like it, about 18 minutes. If there is any leftover liquid in the pot,  drain the rice in a strainer. Remove half of the rice for another day. To  remaining rice, stir in butter and cheese and/or ham; adjust seasoning.
