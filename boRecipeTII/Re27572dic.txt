The Best "Greek Chicken" in the World
Idaho baking potatoes, Whole chickens, olive oil, Lemons, cut into wedges, Butter, 
Place scrubbed potatoes with skins in oven at 375 degrees.  Bake for  45 minutes or until done.  After potatoes are baked, slice them 1 1/2  inches thick.  Place sliced potatoes around freshly cleaned chickens  in a large baking pan.  Sprinkle chickens and potatoes with olive  oil, salt and pepper, fresh oregano, and lemon juice.  Place chunks  of butter inside chickens and onto potatoes.  Also place a lemon  wedge freshly squeezed inside each chicken.  Place inside oven at 325  degrees. Baste chicken and potatoes with juices from the pan for  added moisture. Chickens will be done when skins are crispy brown and  legs lift easily from the joint. Serve the meal with fresh Greek  bread, slightly toasted, to dip into the juices.
