A Pale, Clear Sauce
mushrooms, Salt and fine white pepper, Vegetable stock, onion, Flour, OPTIONAL, Butter, white leek, 
Not to start a sauce war, but this is just my take on the basic sauce scene  based on reading many cook books (written before and after Escoffier), and  just some rule of thumb ideas that seem to work for me.    Melt butter and mix with flour with a fork.  Add warm stock (chicken, veal,  vegetable, whatever), and whisk smooth.  Add optionals if you wish. Simmer,  uncovered, skimming off scum as needed.  Cornstarch can be substituted for  flour by using 1.5 C stock and adding 0.5 C water mixed with cornstarch  after adding stock. Whisk well in either case. The solids can be added then  for the reduction. Strain the solids out before using. This sauce should be  pale and clear. White wine in a modest amount (substitued for stock) with  some tarragon leaves is nice with fowl. Some like a garlic clove.
