Basic Dough  - For Pizza and Focaccia
active dry yeast, water, All-purpose flour, Salt, Yellow cornmeal, 
Sprinkle yeast over water in a small bowl; stir to dissolve yeast. Let  stand about 5 minutes. Stir in flour and salt to make a soft dough. Turn  dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5  minutes, adding more flour if necessary. Shape into a ball. Place in a  greased bowl; turn to coat. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled  in bulk, about 1 hour.    Preheat oven to 425F. Sprinkle two large baking sheets or jelly-roll pans  with cornmeal. Punch down dough. Divide dough in half; roll or pat each  dough piece into an 8-inch round if making pizza. For focaccia, roll or pat  whole dough piece into a 13x9-inch rectangle. Top dough as desired. Bake on  lowest rack 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Makes 6 servings.
