Food & Wine, 9/87.    "The garlic in this dish cooks so long that it mellows and is luscious  spread on grilled or toasted French bread rounds."    1. Preheat the oven to 375. Season the chicken pieces with the salt and 1/2  tsp. of the pepper. In a large flame-proof casserole, heat 2 Tbsp. of the  olive oil over moderately high heat. Add the chicken in batches and brown  evenly, about 3 minutes on each side.    2. Remove the casserole from the heat. Return all of the chicken to the  casserole and add the herbes de Provence, garlic, remaining 1/2 cup plus 2  Tbsp. olive oil and 1/2 tsp. pepper. Toss to coat well. Place aluminum foil  over the casserole and cover with the lid. Bake, without removing the lid,  for 1 hour and 10 minutes.    3. Serve the chicken with the garlic cloves, to be spread onto the toasted  French or Italian bread.
