Carefully remove the shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections  intact. Devein and wash under cold running water; pat dry with paper  towels.  In a dish or bowl, marinate briefly in a mixture of the vodka,  salt, and pepper while you make the batter.    In a mixing, put the flour and baking powder; gradually add the cold water,  whisking until smooth.    In a wok, heat the 2 cup of oil until it reaches 350 degrees F. Add 1  tablespoon of the hot oil to the batter and stir to combine. Take a shrimp  by the tail and dip it into the batter (do not dip the tail), then slide it  into the hot oil. Deep-fry all the shrimp, a few at a time, until golden  brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each batch. Drain on paper  towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish, with the salt/pepper mixture  for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer servings.    FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns. In a dry  frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture. When browned  remove and run the mixture through a grinder.
