Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo)
Cloves garlic, chopped, Crunchy peanut butter, Chicken livers, Sugar, Red chilli, seeded & chopped, Vegetable oil, Dark soy sauce, Sesame paste, Water, 
Saute the garlic and chicken livers in the oil until very darkly coloured.  Grind to a thick paste and return to the pan with the remaining  ingredients. Simmer, adding water to make a thick sauce, for about 2 mins,  stirring constantly. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Use as a dip for  various roasted meats and meatballs and to spread over rice paper before  wrapping cooked ingredients or salad.  A variation to this sauce uses  tamarind pulp instead of the livers to give a tart tasting sauce.
