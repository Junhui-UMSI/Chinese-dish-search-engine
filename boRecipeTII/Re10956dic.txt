Preheat the oven to 425? F.    Remove and discard the fat covering, known as the cap, from the racks.  French-trim the bones of any additional fat, scraping them as clean as  possible. Ask your butcher to do this or to show you how its done.    Season the racks well with salt and black pepper. In a heavy-bottomed  skillet, heat the oil and quickly sear the racks on all sides until nicely  browned. Set aside to cool. In a food processor or blender combine the  garlic, shallots, mustard, mint, sherry and white pepper. Process briefly  to combine all ingredients-the mixture should be quite thick. Place the  lamb in a shallow roasting pan with bones curved-side up. Liberally coat  the top and sides of the racks with the mustard mixture. Roast the lamb for  12 to 15 minutes for medium rare (125? F. on an instant read thermometer).  Allow the racks to rest 5 minutes before cutting. Serve the racks cut into  double chops.    Yield: 4 servings  04/02    NOTES : Note: if you cant find a commercially prepared hot-sweet mustard  at the store, take any hot mustard and add a bit of brown sugar to it.
