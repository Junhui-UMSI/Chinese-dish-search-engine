Finely  chop onion and add to cheese reserving 2-3 tbs for garnish. Heat about 1/2"  oil in a skillet large enough to hold a tortilla. Pass the tortillas  through, one at a time through the hot oil to soften and seal. Do not fry  crisp.  Blot between paper towel to remove oil. Dip each tortilla in the  heated sauce and fill with the cheese and onion. Roll up and place seam  side down in a baking dish. Repeat with the rest of the tortillas. Cover  with foil and bake at 350 for 10 minutes. Remove enchiladas and increase  oven temp to 475. Remove foil and spoon about 1 1/2 cups sauce over the  enchiladas, top with the reserved cheese and return to the oven uncovered  for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Serve the enchiladas  topped with the reserved onion and pass additional sauce separately.
