Trim the veal into neat even pieces. Peel and chop the onion quite finely.  Heat the butter and oil in a flameproof casserole and cook the onion until  golden. Toss the veal in seasoned flour and add to the onion. Cook until  lightly browned, stirring, then add the heated stock. Stir until blended.  Remove enough leaves from the sprigs of dill to give 2 tbsp when chopped.  Set aside the leaves. Add the sprigs, salt, pepper, and mustard to the  casserole and cover. Simmer gently for 1 1/4 hours or until the veal is  tender.    Lift out the dill sprigs and throw away. Add the cream, stir until blended,  then add the chopped dill and stand for a few moments before serving. Serve  with new potatoes or rice and a green salad.
