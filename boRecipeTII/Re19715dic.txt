NOTES : This chili can be mild or very hot depending upon the use of       jalapeno peppers. Some chili lovers say you should never put beans       in chili so this recipe omits them. This recipe is from a truck       driver named Sparky that we met in Arizona, a firm believer in       no-bean chili.
