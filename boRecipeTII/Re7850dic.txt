Portuguese Potato and Kale Soup
Chorizo sausage, olive oil, Potatoes, Kale, Salt and pepper to taste, Chicken Stock, Garlic, Onion, 
submitted by: Alexandra.Houck@ummed.edu  I am not a big fan of kale, but this soup was delicious.    Heat small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo and cook,  stirring until browned, about 3 minutes. Drain and set aside.    In heavy stockpot, heat oil over med heat. Add onions and saute until  softened, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, potatoes & garlic and bring  to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 10 - 15  minutes.    With a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a bowl; lightly mash with a  fork and return to the soup. Bring to a simmer and add kale, a handful at a  time. Simmer until kale is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in reserved  sausage and season with salt & pepper to taste.    NB: I used about 8 oz of a low-fat fully cooked sausage. I did not brown it  as the more you cook this kind of sausage, the less flavor it has. I added  it to the soup after the kale was cooked and allowed it to heat through.
