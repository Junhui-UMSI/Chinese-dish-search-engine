German/Pennsylvania Dutch/Historic    http://www.foodtv.com/midatl/reclist.htm  Personal comment: I grew up not far away from the Pennsylvania Dutch and  just down the road a piece from Valley Forge Park and so I was thrilled  when I found these recipes. I hope someone else out there will also be  interested...    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut butter into dry cake mix until crumbly.  Pat mixture lightly into ungreased 13" x 9" x 2" pan, building up slightly  at edges. Bake 10 minutes. Arrange apple slices on warm crust. Sprinkle  cinnamon on apples. Blend sour cream and egg yolks and drizzle over apples.  Bake 25 minutes or until apples are lightly browned. Serve warm with a  scoop of vanilla ice cream.    Yield: Servings determined by package of cake mix.    Posted to recipelu-digest by LSHW <shusky@erols.com> on Feb 19, 1998
