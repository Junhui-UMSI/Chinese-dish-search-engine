Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 deg. Lightly butter 9 or  10 inch springform pan.  FOR CRUST: Combine walnuts, graham crackers crumbs  and butter. Press compactly onto bottom of pan.   FOR FILLING: Beat cream  cheese in large bowl of electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, sugar, lemon  juice and vanilla and beat thoroughly. Spoon over crust. Set pan on baking  sheet to catch any butter that may drip out. Bake 10 inch cake 40 to 45  minutes or 9 inch cake 50 to 55 minutes. (Cake may rise slightly and crack  in several areas; it will settle again, cracks will minimize and topping  will cover it up.) Remove from oven and let stand at room temperature 15  minutes. Retain oven temperature at 350 deg.   FOR TOPPING: Combine sour  cream, sugar and vanilla and blend well. Cover and refrigerate. When cake  has finished baking, spoon topping over, starting at center and extending  to within 1/2 inch of edge. Return to oven and bake 5 minutes longer. Let  cool, then refrigerate cheesecake for at least 24 hours or preferably 2 to  3 days.   FOR GLAZE: Several hours before serving, wash and hull berries and  let dry completely on paper towels. Combine a little jelly with cornstarch  in saucepan and mix well. Add remaining jelly, Cointreau and water and cook  over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thickened and clear, about 5  minutes. Cool to lukewarm, stirring occasionally. Using knife, loosen cake  from pan; remove springform. Arrange berries pointed end up over top of  cake. Spoon glaze over berries, allowing some to drip down sides of cake.  Return to refrigerator until the glaze is set.      Source: Dallas Jr. League Cookbook Posted by Ken Strei
