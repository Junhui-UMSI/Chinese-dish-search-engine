US Army Chili (1896-1944)
Hot drippings, Onion; (optional), Beefsteak (round), Rice, Salt, Flour, Large dried red chile pods, Boiling water, 
Soldiers of the U.S. Army on the Western frontier had been eating chili  since the war with Mexico (1846) but not necessarily in their messes. The  first Army publication to give a recipe for chili was published in 1896,  The Manual For Army Cooks (War Department Document #18). By World War I,  the Army had added garlic and beans; by World War II, tomatoes. This was a  national pattern: Fannie Farmer did exactly the same (see the editions for  1914, 1930, and 1941)    Chili con carne (1896) (per soldier). 1 beefsteak (round); 1 Tbs. hot  drippings; 2 Tbs. rice; 1 cup boiling water; 2 large dried red chile pods;  1 cup boiling water; flour, salt, and onion (optional).    Cut steak in small pieces. Put in frying pan with hot drippings, cup of hot  water, and rice. Cover closely and cook slowly until tender. Remove seeds  and parts of veins from chile pods. Cover with second cup of boiling water  and let stand until cool. Then squeeze them in the hand until the water is  thick and red. If not thick enough, add a little flour. Season with salt  and a little onion, if desired. Pour sauce over meat-rice mixture and serve  very hot.
