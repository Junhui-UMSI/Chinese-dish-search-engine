Salt, black pepper, celery, Parsley, Salt, Tart green apples, Mayonnaise, Chicken breasts, Celery leaf, walnuts, Dressing, Fresh Lemon Juice, Poaching Liquid, Fresh Lemon Juice, Chicken Stock, Fresh Lemon Juice, dates, Sour cream, 
* Use only the tender inner stalks of celery for this recipe.    ** Note: See the "A Basic Chicken Stock" recipe which is included in this  collection.    Poach the chicken breasts in the poaching liquid for 10 minutes, or just  until the pink color is gone throughout. The breasts will be firm when  pressed with the back of a fork. Let cool to room temperature in the  liquid. Remove and discard the skin and bones, and shred the chicken into  bite-size pieces. Core, peel, and cut apples in 1/2" slices. In a large  bowl, toss the apples with 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Add the chicken,  dates, and celery. Toss to mix well. In a small bowl, whisk together the  sour cream, mayonnaise, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Add to the chicken  mixture, along with salt and pepper. Toss again to combine well. Cover and  chill the salad for 1 hour or more. Just before serving, stir in the  walnuts. This recipe serves 4 to 6.    Comments: Serve this classic fruit and chicken salad on a bed of red and  white cabbage. In addition this, there are several other fruit and chicken  breast combinations you might want to fix. See the variations "Red And  Green Grapes Chicken Salad" and "Mango Chicken Salad" (recipes included in  this collection) for inspiration -- each one is as easy as this recipe.
