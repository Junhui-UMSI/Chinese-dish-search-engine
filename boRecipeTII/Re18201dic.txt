Venison Demi-Glace
Madeira wine, Brown stock, Venison Espagnole sauce, 
Yields 1 quart.    The next one, demi-glace, is the richest-tasting meat-based sauce you can  make.  It freezes well so make plenty.  Its really no more trouble to make  a double or even triple batch.    Method:  Combine Espagnole and stock and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a  simmer and reduce liquid to half volume, a quart, skimming if needed. When  reduced, strain through a fine strainer to remove any lumps.  Add madeira  and either serve or cool.
