Workbasket Recipes: Todays recipes are a sort of "mixed Bag". They are  from the October 1979 issue.    In large bowl, pour milk over Chex, sugar, shortening, salt and spices.  Stir well. Cook to lukewarm. Stir occasionally. Dissolve yeast in water.  Pour into cereal mixture. Add egg. Mix thoroughly. Stir in enough flour to  make a very soft dough. Place on lightly floured surface. Knead a few  times. Place in greased bowl. Cover and let rise in warm place free from  draft until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down. On lightly floured  surface roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with floured donut cutter.  Cover. Let rise on baking sheet in warm place until doubled and very light  (30- 40 minutes). Fry a few at a time in deep hot (375) fat 2 -3 minutes,  turning once. Drain on absorbent paper. While warm, roll in Cinnamon-Sugar  or frost as desired. Makes about 1 1/2 dozen.
