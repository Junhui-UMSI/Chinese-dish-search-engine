Baklava
SYRUP, Fillo dough, Sugar, Sugar, Lemon juice, Water, Piece of orange peel, Piece of cinnamon stick, Pecans (or walnuts), Honey, Cinnamon, NUT FILLING, Ground cloves, Butter/margarine, Piece of lemon peel, 
Combine and simmer the syrup ingredients for 10 minutes, cool and discard  peels and cinnamon stick.  Stir together the nut filling in a seperate  bowl.    Read the directions on the fillo dough box.  It has a lot of hints on how  to handle it.  Brush one third of the sheets with butter and place on a  buttered pan.  Yes, butter each sheet.  No, this is not fattening, the oven  bakes off the calories.  Spread 1/2 of the nut filling on the buttered  sheets.  Butter the next third, layer with the rest of the nut filling, and  butter the last third.  Make sure the top shett is buttered.    With a sharp knife score the pastry into diamonds, do not cut through to  the bottom.  Bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes, or until it is puffed, crisp  and golden brown.  Remove from the oven and pour the cooled syrup over the  top.  Let stand 4 hours (yeah, right) and cut through to the bottom layer.    Lessons Learned:    1.  This is very easy to do, but tedious and time consuming.  From start to  finish it took 3 hours.    2.  Work with a partner, one person buttering and one person placing sheets  is a lot easier.    3.  I didnt have a pan big enough for a full 14 x 18 inch sheet.  I cut  all sheets in half and used two pans, to make 14 x 9 inch sheets.    4.  It seemed to be a little on the dry side, I might consider making more  syrup next time.    5.  Lock your partner in the other room while cooking or they will make  themselves sick.  It is that GOOD!!!
