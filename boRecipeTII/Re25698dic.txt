Carefully add about 1/2 teaspoon (1 teaspoon for the chile  head version) of tabasco down the side of the glass; it should sink to the  bottom. Even more carefully add one ounce of Sambuca (an Italian anise  liquor).  You should have three layers, with the tabasco in the middle.  Drop a coffee bean into the drink. This is usually drunk in one gulp, then  you bite the bean.    You can probably substitute ouzo or anisette for the sambuca, and your  favorite hot sauce for the tabasco as long as its not too thick.  If the  densities of the substitutes are much different, however, you might not get  nice distinct layers.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #285    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
