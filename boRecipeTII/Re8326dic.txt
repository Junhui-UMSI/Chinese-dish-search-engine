Potato Refrigerator Dough
Shortening, Active dry yeast, water, Salt, potatoes, All -purpose flour, Sugar, Eggs, 
Disslove yeast in warm water. Stir in sugar, salt, shortening, eggs,  potatoes and 4 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth. Mix in enough  remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto lightly  floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place in  greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover bowl tightly; refrigerate at  least 8 hours or until ready to use. (Dough can be kept in the refrigerator  up to 5 days at 45 degrees or below. Keep covered.) When ready to use,  punch down dough. Shape into 1" balls. Place into lightly greased round  cake pans. Brush with butter. Bake at 400F for 20 minutes.
