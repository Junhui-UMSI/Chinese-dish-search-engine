Add oil slowly blending until thickened. Stir in poppy seeds.  Serve over pink Texas grapefruit and avocados or any fruit salad. Keep of  Dallas by Candy Colemen. This is perhaps the most famous of all  Neiman-Marcus Zodiac Room recipes, developed by former chef, Helen Corbitt.  It is delicious and I have enjoyed it many times.
