Apricot or Cherry Liqueur
Dried apricots or dried, Bottle (1.75 liter) vodka, Sugar, 
Recipe By: Sunset Magazine Prep Time: 15 minutes, plus at least 2 weeks for  mellowing Makes: About 8 cups of apricot or 7 1/3 cups cherry liqueur    1. Place apricots or cherries, vodka, and sugar in a glass jar (at least  3-quart size). Stir until sugar is mostly dissolved. Cover tightly and let  stand at least 2 weeks or up to 2 months; after a few days shake jar until  sugar completely dissolves. Cherry liqueur may form a slightly cloudy,  harmless residue at the top of the jar.    2. Pour lqueur and fruit, a portion at a time, through a fine strainer into  a pitcher, letting fruit drain completely. Save fruit for other uses  (recipe suggestion follows later). Line strainer with four layers of damp  cheesecloth, set over a spouted container, and pour liqueur through it. Or  for maximum clarity, strain liqueur through a coffee filter, changing  filter often (takes several hours).    3. Pour liqueur into small airtight bottles. Serve liqueur, or store  uptight up to 6 months. (If storing in containers with rubber stoppers,  place a couple of layers of plastic wrap between rubber and bottle to keep  alcohol from softening rubber).    Notes: Slab apricots are the sweetest dried apricots; theyre picked  extra-ripe and soft, and are slightly misshapen. Inexpensive vodka works  fine.    Serving Ideas for Fruit Liqueurs:    * Drizzle over ice cream for an instant but elegant dessert * Add a little  to mixed fresh fruit, spoon over pound cake * Splash into sparkling wine  for a festive aperitif * Flavor holiday fruit cakes with liqueur instead of  rum * Sip and smack your lips happily    Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 184 by Mandy Rose Bell  <mbell@gladstone.uoregon.edu> on Oct 30, 1997
