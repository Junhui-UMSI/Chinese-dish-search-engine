Dontated by marcus356@aol.com Mark ( Marcus ) Shlosberg    *named by my 11 year old son---he claims you only get 3 step after you eat  this chili before it catches up to you---this is a LIE! You can get 5 steps  if you walk fast    After cubing the beef, rinse lightly in cold water and put in Heavy 6 quart  pot with a tight fitting lid, sprinkle meat with salt, peper & garlic  powder to taste, toss to coat meat evenly, cover and let stand at room  temprature for about 15 minutes to marinate. disolve the beef bouliion cube  in one cup boiling water, and add to the reserved liquid from the  nopalitos. after marinating place meat over High heat and cook until just  done DO NOT BROWN stirring constantly to prevent sticking reduce temprature  to medium, and add onions and boullion mixture cover & simmer 10 minutes  until the onions are just soft. Add tomatoes, nopalitos and chili powder  cover again and simmer 30 minutes, add beans and a little water if  necessary to prevent scorching, cover and simmer another 30 minutes, adjust  seasonings to taste reduce heat to low cover and simmer another 30 minutes  or until meat is tender ENJOY!
