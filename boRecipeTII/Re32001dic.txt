Combine all the ingredients thoroughly. Core the hot dogs diagonally on  three sides. Barbecue basting with the sauce about three times while they  are cooking. You can also use this on pork or chicken or the heated sauce  in a chafing dish with sliced hot dogs. Makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce,  (enough for 2 lbs of hot dogs).
