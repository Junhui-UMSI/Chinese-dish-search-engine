Theresas Short-Skirt Chili
Honey, Dried Chili Anchos, If poss, Garlic, Beef Skirt -- (tenderized,, Ground cumin, Paprika, Soy sauce, Oregano -- (Mexican), Each), Green Chilies -- (4-oz, Tomatoes, Onion -- white, 
Cut the stems from the anchos, and remove seeds. Cover with boiling water  and let sit for an hour. Blend in blender with the garlic until smooth.    Slightly warm the honey and mix in the soy sauce. Coat beef skirt with meat  tenderizer (if you think necessary) and honey-soy and let sit 15 minutes.  Cook beef skirt on very hot grill, basting often with honey/soy mixture. I  prefer a fairly charred result. When done properly, this activity should  remind you of watching the Kuwaiti oil    fields on CNN. Warning - this procedure produces yummy-tasting carcinagens!    Cut beef skirt across the grain into 1/4" strips, and set aside a little  for snacking. Dice the green chilies, onion, and tomatoes. Add the beef,  vegetables, and spices to large pot. Add half the ancho sauce and water or  beer to barely cover. Add more ancho sauce over time to suit your taste.  Cook until meat is really tender, which, for skirt, could be days. (Just  kidding!)
