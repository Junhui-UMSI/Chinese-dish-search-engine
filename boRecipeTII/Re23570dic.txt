Arroz De Bacalhau
olive oil, Steak dried salt cod, salt and pepper, Ripe tomato (or dbl. amt.), Onion, Short-grain rice, 
Short-grain rice adds the perfect texture to this traditional dish from  northern Portugal. The salt cod may eliminate the need for additional salt.    BROWN THE ONION in the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over moderate  heat. Meanwhile, shred the cod, remove the skin and bones and wash but do  not soak. Add the cod to the onion, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and leave to cook 20-to-30 minutes, covered, over low  heat. Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice. Add 3 1/3 cups water to the pan  (add twice as much water as there is rice), season to taste with salt and  pepper. When the water boils, add the rice and continue to cook on low heat  until the rice is done--probably 25-to-30 minutes. Cover the kettle for the  last half of cooking.
