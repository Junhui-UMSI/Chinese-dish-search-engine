Pickled Eggs with Beets

Wash the beets; place in a large saucepan with water to cover and bring to  a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until tender.  Drain and cover with cold water; trim off the tops and roots and slip off  the skins. Divide between 2 widemouthed quart jars.    In a large saucepan, combine the rest of the ingredients except the eggs.  Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Divide liquid between the 2 jars and allow  to cool completely. Add the eggs to the cold beet mixture and refrigerate  for 2 days.    NOTE: If you add eggs to the hot liquid, you get a very rubbery,  practically inedible egg.
