Cut asparagus in 1 inch pieces; cook in boiling salted water until  tender, about 2 to 4 minutes.   Drain thoroughly.       Melt 1 T butter in 8 inch skillet, preferably one with non-stick  lining; saute garlic and mushrooms until done and moisture has evaporated.  Remove from pan; keep warm.       In a small bowl, combine eggs, milk, salt, basil and pepper. Melt  remaining butter in skillet until foamy, swirling it around pan to coat  evenly.  When hot enough that a drop of water sizzles when dropped in, pour  in egg mixture.  Tip pan so eggs coat skillet evenly. As eggs cook,  periodically lift up cooked edges, tilt pan and let uncooked egg run  underneath.   When eggs are cooked, but surface is still shiny, place asparagus and  mushrooms on one side; slide out of pan, folding side without vegetables  over top.   Serve immediately
