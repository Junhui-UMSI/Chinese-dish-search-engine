Paprika (optional), Tauco (salted yellow beans), Brown sugar, Vegetable oil, Ground ginger, Water, Garlic, Onions, Roasting chicken, Tamarind water, Chilli powder, Dark soya sauce, 
This recipe calls for tauco which can be either salted black beans  or salted yellow beans.  Either can be found in a Chinese market as  salted black bean or salted yellow bean sauce.  Or you can track down  Indonesian salted yellow beans and smash em up yourself.  Thai  markets carry them.    Cut the chicken into serving pieces; wash, and dry.  Slice the onions.  Pound the garlic and the tauco into a smooth paste.    Fry the onions in the oil for half a minute.  Add the tauco, then the  chicken.  Stir well, so that every part of the chicken is coated with  tauco.  Put in the soya sauce and the rest of the ingredients.  Cover, and simmer very gently for 45 minutes.  Then take the lid off,  and cook for a further 5 minutes to reduce the sauce.  Serve hot.    Makes 4 servings.    From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London,  1986."
