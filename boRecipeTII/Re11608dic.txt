Whisk into the breadcrumb mixture then pour into a 1 to 1.5  pint/600 to 900 ml greased ovenproofdish. Stand the dish in a roasting tin  of cold water. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the mixture is set.  Spread with the raspberry jam. Reduce the oven heat to 150C/300F, Gas Mark  2. Whisk the egg whites until stiff.
