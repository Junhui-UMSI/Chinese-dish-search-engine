Bean Burrito Casserole
Pinto beans; canned, rinsed, Brown rice; cooked, Garlic powder, Cornstarch; *** see note, Green Onions, Water, Tortillas; * see note, ENCHILADA SAUCE, Chili powder, Tomato sauce; ** see note, Onion powder, 
Preparation Time: 2:07 This may be made without the brown rice; use 5 cups  mashed cooked and drained beans instead. The sauce can also be used in  other Mexican recipes.    To make the enchilada sauce combine all ingredients in a saucepan and cook,  stirring constantly, until the mixture boils and thickens, about 7 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the enchilada sauce in the  bottom of a covered casserole dish. Take one tortilla at a time and spread  some beans, rice, and scallons down the center. Roll up and place  seam-side-down in the casserole dish. Repeat until all ingredients are  used. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the rolled-up tortillas,  cover, and bake for 30 minutes.
