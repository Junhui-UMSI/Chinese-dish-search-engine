Make marinade by heating wine, onion, cloves, garlic, and bay leaf in a  sauce pan.  Just before it boils, pour over chicken parts in a bowl. Cover  and let cool. Refrigerate overnight. (You can refrigerate in morning so  that it is ready by evening.)    Remove chicken parts from marinade.  Dredge in flour and sprinkle with salt  and pepper.  Use large skillet and saute in olive oil. Remove. Pour off any  excess fat from pan. Discard bay leaf and cloves from marinade and add  marinade to pan.  Simmer for 5 minutes and then return chicken to pan,  spooning sauce over top. Add broth and bring to simmer, stirring  occasionally.  Cover and cook 15 minutes or until tender, turning chicken  at least once.    While chicken is simmering, heat sugar in small saucepan until it melts to  a golden color.  Stir in vinegar. Pour this over chicken a few minutes  before it is done and stir to blend. Serves 4-6. Source: The Sicilian  Gentlemens Cookbook by Don Barrata.    Shared and MM by Judi M.
