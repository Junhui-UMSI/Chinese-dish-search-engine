* Since I make this with a bread machine I am going to give the  instructions for a bread machine.    Measure all dough ingredients into bread machine pan in order suggested by  manufacturer. Process on dough/manual cycle. To shape and fill: When cycle  is complete, remove dough to floured surface. If necessary, knead in  additional flour to make dough easy to handle. Role dough to 18-in. x  12-in. rectangle. Combine filling ingredients and sprinkle to within 1/2  in. of edges. Beginning at long end, roll up tightly; pinch seam to seal.  Place, seam side down, on large greased baking sheet. Form into "S" shape.  Tuck both ends under center of "S" to form a "figure 8"; pinch dough to  join. With sharp knife, cut down center of roll, about 1 in. deep, to  within 1/2 in. of ends. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until  doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40  minutes, covering with aluminum foil after 25 minutes to prevent excess  browning. Remove from pan; cool on wire rack.    Yield 1 loaf (12 servings)  My secretary doesnt like Swiss but went on and on about how good this  tasted. She had assumed I hadnt used Swiss cheese until she asked me when  I told her that yes it did have Swiss cheese in it. I have made it using  provalone instead of Swiss and really liked it as well. Im sure Ill get  around to other combinations of cheese but really do like the original mix  so if you dont like Swiss cheese you might want to give this a try anyway.
