Bagels
Boiling water, Poppy seed or sesame seed;, Salad oil, Flour, Sugar, Lukewarm potato water*, Cakes fresh yeast, Eggs; slightly beaten, Sugar, Salt, 
You are absolutely correct on both counts - they are both easy and  delightfully delicious. This is the recipe I have been using to make  homemade bagels since the 60s. This recipe comes from an absolutely  marvelous little cookboo (currently in reprint) named "Love and Knishes"  authored by Sara Kasden, and sub titled "How to Cook Like a Jewish Mother".  Its full of great recipes as well as top notch humor.    Sift together dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Soften yeast in one  third of the potato water. Add to the flour. Add oil to the remaining  potato water and stir into the flour. Add eggs and stir briskly to form a  ball of dough.    Knead on a lightly floured board for 10 minutes. This must be a firm dough;  add more flour if necessary. Return to the bowl, smooth side up. Cover with  a tea towel and let rise at room temperature until the dough rises to the  top of the bowl. Knead again on a lightly floured board until smooth and  elastic (as for rolls). Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between the  palms to form ropes about 6 inches long and 3/4 inch wide. Pinch the ends  together firmly to make a doughnut shape.    Add sugar to boiling water. Drop bagels into the water one at a time. As  they come to the surface, turn them over. Boil 1 minute longer on the  second side. Place on a greased cooky sheet and bake at 450 until the crust  is golden brown and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Bagels may be sprinkled with  poppy seed or sesame seed before baking, if desired. Makes about 30.    * Potato water is water in which potatoes have been boiled. Plain water may  be used in its place, but bagels are better with potato water!    Posted to EAT-L Digest  by BirdsEtc <BirdsEtc@AOL.COM> on Jan 7, 1998
