For quick meringues, preheat the oven to 320F. Line a baking sheet with  non-stick paper. Place egg whites and icing sugar in a bowl over a pan of  hot water and with an electric whisk, whisk until mixture in stiff and  standing in peaks. Place mixture in a piping bag fitted with a 1 cm star  nozzle and pipe small blobs onto lined baking sheet. Bake in the oven for  10-15 minutes until crisp on the outside. Allow to cool before removing  from paper.    In a saucepan, blend the cornflour smoothly with a little of the cream.  Stir in the remainder and add sugar and raspberry puree. Cook over a gentle  heat until smooth and thickened. Stir in the Framboise, if desired, then  pour into a fondue pot and serve with small meringues. Serve hot or cold.
