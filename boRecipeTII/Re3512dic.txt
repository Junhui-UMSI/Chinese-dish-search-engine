Egg whites beaten stiff, Crushed Ritz cracers, Sugar, Cut pecans, Brown sugar, MIX TOGETHER, MIX TOGETHER, Teas vanilla, 
(My mom always made this, she got the recipe from the back of a RITZ  cracker box when I was in the seventh grade (Im now 45 so this recipe has  definitely stood the test of time!)    THEN: Gently fold first mixture into second mixture.  Bake at 350 degrees  20 minutes or until peaks are browning.    (Incredibly delicious, no one will suspect how easy it is!)
