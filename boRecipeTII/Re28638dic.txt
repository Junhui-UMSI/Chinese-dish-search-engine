SERVES 6, AT LEAST HINT: ON PREPARING COOKED BEANS FOR CHILI WITH BEANS:       Chili with beans has a much better flavor if you use dried beans and  cook them yourself rather than using canned beans. Simply soak the needed  amount of red kidney or other beans in ample water overnight. Then simmer  until tender. The beans are then drained and added to the chili. Cook the  beans in the chili sauce and simmer for 1 to 1-1/2 more hours.      This old version does not call for dried meat as the original probably  did, but it does call for good beef chuck, not fatty hamburger. No, real  Texas chili need not have beans at all!      Place the cumin seeds in a pie pan and toast in a 375? oven for 10  minutes. Remove and set aside.      Heat a 6-quart kettle and saute the bacon until clear. Add the diced meat  and brown over high heat along with the onions, garlic, and jalape?os.      When the meat is brown and the onions clear, add the remaining  ingredients. Mash up the tomatoes with your hands, but add the juice as  well. Simmer for 1 hour and correct the seasoning.      Cooked beans can be added to this, but they are strictly optional.
