At least 1 hour and up to 4 hours before you plan to grill swordfish  steaks, prepare dry rub, combining ingredients in a small bowl. Rub steaks  with mixture, wrap them in plastic and refrigerate.    For the vinaigrette: Combining ingredients in a food processor.    Remove steaks from refrigerator and let sit covered at room temperature for  about 30 minutes.    Fire up grill, bringing the temperature to medium-high (3 seconds with the  hand test).    Transfer steaks to a well-oiled grate and grill uncovered over medium-high  heat for 4 to 5 minutes per side, until opaque throughout. Rotate fish 180  degrees once on each side. If there is any resistance when you turn or  rotate fish, re-oil the grate. If grilling 1 covered, cook for the same  amount of time, turning and rotating in a similar manner.    Serve steaks hot, drizzled with vinaigrette,    Notes: REF: Born to Grill : An American Celebration by Cheryl Alters  Jamison, Bill Jamison (Harvard Common Pr, May 1998 ISBN: 155832111X)    Hanneman May 1998 >McRecipe    Recipe by: Born to Grill, Jamison & Jamison    Posted to bbq-digest by "Garry Howard" <garry@netrelief.com> on May 28,  1998
