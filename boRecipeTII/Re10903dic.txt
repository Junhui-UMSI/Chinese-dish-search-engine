Lemon juice, **********FILLING***********, **********PASTRY************, Rabbit meat, chopped into, Plain flour, Lard, Turnips, Little amount of stock, Potatoes, Carrots, Onions, Seasonings, Salt, 
Make the pastry and roll out to a round.  Cut up the meat and vegetables  into small cubes.  Place the vegetables and meat in the middle of the  pastry round.  Season and just put a little stock over. Seal the pastry and  stand it on its base on a baking tray.  Crimp the edges and brush with  milk.  Bake for about 1-1 1/2 hours in a moderate oven, or as the contents  are uncooked, maybe a little longer. This amount makes one huge hoggan or 6  smaller ones.
