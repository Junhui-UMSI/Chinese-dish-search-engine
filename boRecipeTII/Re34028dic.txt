Basil-Garlic Chicken Breasts with Peaches
Balsamic vinegar, Garlic; minced, olive oil, Molasses, Freshly cracked black pepper, Basil; roughly chopped, Salt and freshly cracked, Whole boneless chicken, Peaches; halved and pitted, 
NOTE: ** 10 to 12 ounces each. If you cant find boneless chicken breasts  with the two halves still attached, substitute 8 halves.    INSTRUCTIONS: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar  to a boil and cook until it is reduced by half, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in  the molasses and black pepper, remove from the heat and set aside.    Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the basil, garlic and olive oil, and  mix well. Rub the chicken breasts with this mixture, sprinkle lightly with  salt and pepper, and grill over a medium fire, skin side down, until the  skin is crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the breasts over and grill for  another 6 minutes. To check for doneness, nick one of the breasts at the  fattest point; the meat should be fully opaque with no traces of pink.    As the chicken breasts are finishing up, place the peaches on the fire, cut  side down, and grill until they are nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Flip  them over, brush the cut side with the balsamic glaze, and continue to cook  for another 2 minutes. Remove the peaches from the grill, give them another  coat of glaze, and serve whole or sliced with the chicken breasts.
