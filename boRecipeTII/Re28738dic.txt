Recipe by: Joe Mannke of Rotisserie for Beef and Bird,  Houston, TX    Preparation Time: 3:30    STEP ONE: To Make the Stock-- In large pot combine  ducks, 2 stalks celery, one small onion (sliced),  diced carrots, salt, and gallon water. Bring to a boil  and simmer for 3 hours, from time to time skimming off  the foam.    STEP TWO: To Make the Gumbo-- Make the roux of flour  and vegetable oil until dark and brown. Add the bell  peppers, red and black pepper, celery, and onions.  Remove the ducks from the stock and reduce the broth  to 2-1/2 quarts. Strain and pour over the roux. Simmer  the gumbo for 20 minutes.    Remove all the meat from the bones, dice in 1/2-inch  squares, and add to the gumbo. Broil the sausage,  slice, and also add to the soup. Add the oysters and  scallions at last and bring to a boil.    Serve over rice with Tabasco sauce as needed.
