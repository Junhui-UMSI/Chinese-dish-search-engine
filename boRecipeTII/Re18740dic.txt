Recipe By: The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever, Madge Rosenberg.     Note: The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg loaf  and (1T) for the smaller loaf.  I omitted it.  Could use Wonderslim or  possibly applesauce instead.     Add all ingredients in teh order suggested by your bread machine manual  and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturers  directions. Let the loaf cool before slicing.
