Vodka Berries: Rinse berries and drain well.  Layer strawberries and  raspberries in a 2-quart glass jar.  Top with orange slices and  blackberries. Pour vodka over berries until fruit is covered, then cover  the jar.  Save the empty vodka bottle. Let berries macerate in vodka for  three to six days. Strain the berries from the vodka, then pour vodka back  into the saved bottle.    For the granita: Puree berries and strain through a fine mesh strainer.  Pour strained berry juice into large measuring cup.  Measure the juice,  then add an equal amount of water. Pour into bowl. Whisk in sugar to taste,  at least 1+1/4 cup, and stir until dissolved. Pour into a baking pan  measuring 9 by 13 by 2 inches and place in freezer until ice crystals form,  about 30 minutes. Use a fork to break up frozen crystals. Continue freezing  and stirring every 30 to 45 minutes until mixture is completely frozen and  ice crystals are uniform in size. Scoop crystals into goblet and garnish  with mint or extra berries. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    BERRIES TAKE 3-6 DAYS!    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
