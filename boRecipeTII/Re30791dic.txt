Tangerine Portabello Mushrooms
Brown sugar, Horseradish, juice of 3 tangerines, olive oil, Sherry, Portabello mushrooms, 
Saute the sliced mushrooms in the olive oil for about five minutes, or  until they start to give off their moisture. Mix the tangerine juice (Im  sure you could use orange juice), the sherry, the brown sugar, and the  horseradish together and pour over the mushrooms. Cook over medium heat for  about ten more minutes until the sauce has reduced by one-half and has  glazed the mushrooms.    I actually started feeling much better after I ate this concoction and  think I will keep the recipe to use as a side dish with chicken or over  rice for a light supper.
