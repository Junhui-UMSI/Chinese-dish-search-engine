Pomerantzen
Oranges or 6 small, Sugar; approximately, Salt, Water, 
Peel the fruit, removing as much of the white pith as possible. Slice peel  into strips about 3- inches long and 1/2- inch wide. Let them curl up. Put  peels in a large crock and add water and salt. Leave overnight.    Drain the peels and rinse thoroughly. Put in a saucepan of cold water and  bring to a boil. Immediately after the water boils, drain the peels. Repeat  this procedure 3 times. Weigh the peels.    Put an equal weight of sugar into a heavy-based pan (about 3 cups), then  add half that amount of water (about 1-1/2 cups) and bring to a boil  without stirring. As soon as the syrup boils, add the peels and reduce the  heat to low. Cook without stirring until all the syrup has been absorbed.  Remove the peels, separate with a fork, and drain on wire racks with waxed  paper beneath to catch the drips. When peels are cool enough to handle,  pour 1 cup sugar into a shallow bowl and roll the peels in it, adding more  sugar if necessary.    Spread out the peels on racks and let dry, lightly covered with parchment  or waxed paper, in a warm place for 2 days. Roll again, this time in  confectioners sugar, then store in airtight tins.    Makes 6 cups.    VARIATION: Try other thick-skinned citrus peels. Make an attractive curled  shape by stringing the peels on a thread before soaking them in brine,  parboiling, and dipping in syrup.    This candy is traditionally served during Sukkot.
