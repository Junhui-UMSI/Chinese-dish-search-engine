Philadelphia Rice Pudding
Freshly grated nutmeg, Vanilla extract, Sugar, Long-grain rice; rinsed &, Salt, milk, 
This one comes from the hand of Mr. Jeffersons granddaughter, Virginia  Randolph Trist. Her instructions are a little vague, as are all cookbook  instructions from that time, so I have developed the following recipe. It  is very tasty and again points to Thomas Jeffersons fondness for rice.      Mix all of the above together and place in a 3-quart covered saucepan.  Bring to a simmer on the top of the stove and then place, covered, in a  300? oven. Bake without disturbing or stirring for 2 hours and 45 minutes.  The pudding will almost caramelize and become a pale golden color. It is  just terrific.      Mrs. Trist used to cook this in a slow fireplace for 5 or 6 hours. I  suggest you try the above method since your fireplace is not really ready  for a cooking fire that will gently smolder for 5 to 6 hours.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
