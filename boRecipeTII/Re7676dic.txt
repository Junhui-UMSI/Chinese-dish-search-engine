1. In a large, heavy skillet over high heat, toast walnuts 2 to 3 minutes,  stirring frequently. Remove and set aside.    2. Season chops with salt and pepper to taste. Trim a piece of fat from the  edge of one chop. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, heat fat until  lightly browned, using a spoon to press and rub fat over bottom of skillet  to grease it well. Discard fat and increase heat to high.    3. Add chops; brown quickly on both sides. Pour excess fat, if any, from  skillet.    4. Add apple juice, brandy, garlic, thyme, and apples to pan.    5. Cover pan and cook over medium-low heat 5 to 8 minutes. To test for  doneness, cut into a chop; it should be tender, juicy, and slightly pink.  If pork is done and apples are still crunchy, remove pork to a platter and  cover with foil to keep warm. Continue to cook apples until they are  tender.    6. Stir walnuts into sauce in pan. Pour walnut-apple sauce over chops.  Serve chops immediately.    Recipe By     : the California Culinary Academy    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
