We didnt filet the trout, so it was baked whole, but I  imagine you could use the recipe for the filets.    Soak the trout in salt water for 15 minutes.  Rinse well and scrape the  skin lightly. Rinse again. Salt and pepper the cavity. Thinly slice the  onion and place several slices inside the cavity. Clean the basil and  coarsly chop. Place the basil in the cavity also. Use about 4-5 very large  leaves. Place the trout in a baking pan with just a small amount of water.  Cover will foil and bake at 350 degrees. These were extremely large trout  that my brother had caught. They were over a pound each and about 18" long.  I baked them for about 25 minutes. During the last 10 minutes of baking  time I spread the garlic-almond butter on top, recoved with the foil and  baked for 5 minutes more. The last five minutes I removed the foil.    Garlic-almond butter: Puree the garlic and butter together in the processor  then put in a heavy skillet on medium high heat.  When the butter begins to  sizzle add the slivered almonds and toast until just beginning to turn  golden. Remove >from the heat and add the lemon and mix well.    I would think that you could salt and pepper the filets, lay them in a  baking dish, then cover with basil then onions and the foil.  The filets  would not take nearly so long to bake--maybe 15 minutes with the last few  minutes baking uncovered and with the garlic-almond butter on. Fresh water  trout is done when it flakes easily apart. But, as with all fish, it  doesnt take very long to cook.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FISH    From rec.food.cooking archives.
