1. Heat bacon fat in a large heavy pot over low heat; saute onion, garlic,  and green pepper until limp. Add remaining ingredients, blend well, bring  to simmering, then lower heat and cook slowly until thick. Remove and  discard lemon quarters. This sauce keeps well in the refrigerator, and  Sybil often doubles the recipe to have on hand to use whenever a barbecue  recipe is called for. Heat well before using. Baste over meat during last  15 minutes of cooking, and, if desired, spoon over cooked meat before  serving.    2. Excellent for chicken, spareribs, pork chops, hamburgers, hot dogs,  steaks and kabobs - just about any barbecued meat.
