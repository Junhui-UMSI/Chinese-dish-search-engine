Toss cheeses with cornstarch until coated. Rub garlic on bottom and side  of heavy saucepan or skillet and add wine. Heat over low heat just until  bubbles rise to surface (wine should not boil). Stir in lemon juice.  Gradually add cheeses, about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly with  wooden spoon over low heat until cheeses are melted. Stir in kirsch, salt  and white pepper. Remove to earthenware fondue dish and keep warm over low  heat. Spear bread cubes with fondue forks and dip and swirl in fondue with  stirring motion.
