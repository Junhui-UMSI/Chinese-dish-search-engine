Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 10  minutes. Remover and discard the garlic. Increase the heat to moderately  high. Add the bread cubes and saute, turning, until golden brown and crisp  on all sides, about 5 minutes. Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper  and drain on paper towels; set aside.    In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, chicken stock and wine. Add the  remaining 1/8 tsp each of salt and pepper, then gradually whisk in the  remaining 1/4 cup walnut oil.    Cut each slice of prosciutto into 4 lengthwise strips. In a large bowl,  lightly coat the greens with the dressing. Add the croutons and toss well.  Place the salad on 2 large dinner plates and arrange the prosciutto strips  decoratively on top. Serve immediately.
