Yorkshire Pudding #5
Eggs, All-Purpose Flour, Beef drippings, milk, Salt, Black Pepper, 
From: plgold@ix.netcom.com (Pat Gold)    Date: 22 Mar 1995 19:06:47 -0600  This standard recipe resembles the popover recipe.  Usually it is baked in  a flat pan (11x14x2 1/2) swathed with plenty of hot beef drippings. It is  also baked in muffin pans or in a 2-quart ring mold. If you are making  pudding for a large group or for large appetites, it would be wise to  double the quantities given here.    Beat the eggs until quite light and gradually beat in the milk and sifted  flour.  Or put all at once into an electric mixer or blender or food  processor and beat, whirl, or process for a few seconds just until the  batter is smooth. Flavor with salt and pepper and add, if you like, 2  tablespoons drippings. Heat the pan, muffin tins, or mold, and pour in a  heavy layer of hot drippings. Then pour in the batter and bake at 450  degrees about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees and continue  baking 15 or 20 minutes or until beautifully brown and puffy. Do not open  the oven door during the first 20 minutes of baking.    NOTE:  Some people like to add a clove of garlic to the beaten batter,  which is removed before the batter is poured into the pan, or they rub the  pan with garlic before adding the drippings.
