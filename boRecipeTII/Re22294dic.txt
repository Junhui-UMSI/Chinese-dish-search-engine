Turkey with Mushrooms and Marsala
Gravy, Butter or olive oil for, Marsala wine to taste, Mushrooms, Cooked turkey, 
You are probably just as good as I am at thinking up ways to use  leftovers, but I really do like this simple but flavorful solution to using  turkey "again."      saute the mushrooms in butter or olive oil. Cook them just until they  begin to brown. You need a hot pan for this.      Add a bit of gravy and the Marsala to taste. You can use either sweet or  dry wine, according to your familys preference. Add the leftover turkey  and heat. This is good over toast, rice, noodles, fingers, and so on.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
