Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 3-4 minutes for each batch    A.D. Livingston, an Alabama outdoors writer, has been fascinated with cast  iron ever since college, when he met a student who swore that his grandma  had a skillet that hadnt been washed in more than 100 years. She just  wiped it out. Talk about seasoning. This breakfast recipe comes from  Livingstons book "Cast-Iron Cooking."    Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl. In another bowl,  whisk the egg and mix in the buttermilk and bacon drippings. Mix the  contents of the two bowls, stirring until you have a smooth batter. Heat  your griddle, but do not grease it. Drop the batter onto the griddle by the  spoonful, allowing almost 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until  bubbles appear on the top. Turn and cook on the other side. (Usually, the  underside will be ready when the top side responds to the touch test. Stick  your finger lightly into the pancake, and then quickly draw it back. If the  finger leaves a deep indentation, the pancake isnt ready. When done, the  pancake will more or less spring back into shape.)
