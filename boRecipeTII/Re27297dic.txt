Very gently, press small bits of dried fruit on dough to decorate.  6. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven for 10-12 minutes or until browned. Do  not overcook. Remove cookies to wire rack to cool. Continue with rest of  cookie dough in same manner, greasing cookie sheet each time.    Yield: About 30-36 cookies.
