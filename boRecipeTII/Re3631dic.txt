Pegs Many Bean Soup
Salt, Chopped green peppers, Ground sage, Pepper, Bunch Celery, finely diced, Chicken Stock, thereabouts, Onions, Grated carrots, Grated potato, Diced pork (chop suey pork), Dash Red pepper, Mixed Beans, dried, Sweet basil, dried, Jimmy Dean Sausage (hot), 
Presoak (8 hrs) or preboil (1 hr) beans, drain and rinse. Add chicken stock  to soup pot and add beans. Turn heat on low. Add all ingredients just like  that. Do not precook meat. The grated potato thickens the broth, another  favorite thickener may be used, I prefer the potato. Simmer this soup for 2  hours before serving. I probably add more basil than listed, do that to  taste.  Go easy on the sage but it is quite important. You may add a  tablespoon of sugar to perk this soup up a bit, I do not recall off hand if  I did or not. Another ingredient to perk it up is a tablespoon of  vinegar--dont overdo.
