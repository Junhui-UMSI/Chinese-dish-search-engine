Pear Liquor
Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Pears, SUGAR SYRUP, Coriander seed, Apple (optional), White granulated sugar, Sugar syrup (recipe follows), Clove, Vodka, Water, 
The bartlett pear is the best to use for liquor making. It is juicy, sweet  and smooth. Avoid one with cuts, bruises, dark spots or decay.    Slice pears (and apple if desired) and add to other ingredients, adding  sugar syrup last. Stir gently and steep 3 weeks. Strain and filter. Taste  and adjust flavor by adding more fruit or sugar syrup if needed. Steep  another 3-4 weeks, strain. Ready for use. Yield 1.5 pints. Container: Wide  mouth 1/2 gallon jar.    SUGAR SYRUP: Boil together for about 5 minutes at a full boil and be sure  the sugar dissolves. The syrup MUST BE COOL before adding to the alcohol  mix as the heat evaporates the alcohol.
