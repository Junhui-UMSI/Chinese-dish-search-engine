You can... try it next time you make a packaged cake or brownie  mix. This recipe is a good one. The riper the bananas, the better. You can  save old, soft, peeled bananas in the freezer until you want to make these  delicious muffins.    You can also add chopped nuts, raisins, carob or chocolate chips or any  other surprise treat !    EQUIPMENT: Big mixing bowl, potato masher, measuring spoons and cups,  muffin pan and muffin papers.    METHOD: HEAToven to 375 degrees.  MASH the bananas in the big mixing bowl  with the potato masher.  ADD the sugar, eggs and applesauce and mix well.  STIR baking soda into yogurt or sour cream and it will become foamy which  makes the muffins rise.  ADD the flour and wheat germ and stir until just  mixed (muffins wont rise if you overmix).  SPOON mixture into muffin  papers in muffin pan. BAKE about 10 -15 minutes until done.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 233    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
