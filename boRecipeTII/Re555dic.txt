In wok, combine ground beef and pork, carrots and onions. Cook over medium  heat. As meat begins to brown, add remaining vegetables, soy sauce, and  sugar. Continue cooking until vegetables are tender and liquid has mostly  evaporated. Combine cornstarch with rice, wine and 2 tablespoons cold  water. Season meat with pepper and green onions. Stir in cornstarch mixture  and cook 1-2 minutes.    Place one teaspoon of filling into center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten  edges with water, fold four corners into center and seal. Place each wonton  as it is finished on a plate covered with damp towel to prevent drying.  Continue filling until all wrappers are used. Fry in hot oil on each side  until lightly browned.
