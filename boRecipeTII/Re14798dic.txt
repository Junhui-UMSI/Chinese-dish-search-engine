Stir all ingredients in large bowl, turn out and  knead about 5 minutes, adding flour if needed. Knead about 5 minutes. Let  rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Knead down and shape  into 6 loaves, let rise until doubled in pans. Bake at 375 degrees F. for  40 minutes. Turn out on wire rack and let cool to cold before slicing, if  you can. NOTE:Raisins and/or walnuts can be added for a change. Also this  bread freezeswell.    EAT-L Digest 13 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
