Plum Chutney
Apples, Brown sugar, Curry powder, Onions, Dry mustard, fresh ginger, White vinegar, Plums, Currants, Salt, 
Cook all except sugar.    Add sugar to dissolve.    Cook and bottle.    This is a recipe I used to make up in a restaurant I worked in when we had  a glut of blood plums. It is pretty simple but good, especially if left to  mature a while in the bottle.
