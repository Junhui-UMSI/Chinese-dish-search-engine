Heat the oven to 450 degees. Pre a pie crust according to package  directions for unfilled 1-crust pie, using 10-inch tart pan with removable  bottom or 9-inch pie pan. Refrigerate remaining crust for later use. Place  prepared crust in pan; press in bottom and up sides of pan. Trim edges if  necessary. Generously prick crust with fork. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or  until light golden brown. Cool completely.     In medium saucepan, combine caramels and 1/2 cup whipping cream; cook over  low heat until caramels are melted and mixture is smooth, stirring  occasionally. Remove from heat. Add pecans; stir well to coat. Spread  evenly over cooled, baked crust.     In small saucepan over low heat, melt margarine and chocolate chips,  stirring constantly. Add 1 tablespoon whipping cream; stir until well  blended. Drizzle over pecan filling. Refrigerate 1 hour or until filling is  firm. Garnish with sweetened whipped cream, if desired. Makes 12 servings.
