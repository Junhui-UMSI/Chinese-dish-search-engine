Yummy Bruschetta
Chopped fresh oregano, Capers, rinsed, Balsamic vinegar, Black Pepper, 5 roma tomatoes, finely, Minced red or white onion, Garlic, Chopped fresh basil, 
Mix this all together in a container and let sit for at least one hour! We  ran everything through the food processor, so it hardly took any time at  all. It tasted great that night, and the leftover report is that it  improves over the next couple of days!    The Tracy Pikhart Ritter recipe suggests toasting french bread in a 350  degree oven till brown.  Top with room temperature bruschetta.    enjoy!
