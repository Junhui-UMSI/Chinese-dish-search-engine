First, make the cheese patties by placing the farmer cheese, feta cheese,  garlic and dill in a blender or food processor. Blend until well combined.  With a tablespoon and floured hands, form the cheese into 2 large or 4  small patties.    Spread the flour in a shallow plate, the egss in a shallow bowl and the  bread crumbs in another plate. Carefully dredge each patty in flour, them  dip in the egg, and finally roll in the bread crumbs, gently pressing so  the crumbs adhere. Dip each patty once more in the egg and coat again with  crumbs. Place patties on a lightly oiled baking sheet and refrigerate until       20    minutes before serving.    Preheat the oven to 350#161#F. Bake the cheese patties until well browned  (about 20 minutes).    While the patties are baking, prepare the dressing. Place the garlic,  vinegar, raspberries, honey, oil, and pepper in a jar with a tight-fitting  lid. Shake vigorously until well emulsified and set aside.    Arrange the spinach leaves and scallions in a large bowl and toss with the  dressing. Divide the spinach between the plates and top each with a hot  cheese patty. Grind fresh black pepper over each and serve immediately with  a basket of hot French bread.    COMMENTS: John and I adore this!    Nutr.
