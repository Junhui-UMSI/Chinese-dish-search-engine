Veal Picatta
Flour, Chicken broth, Fresh Lemon Juice, Salt and lemon pepper, Dry white wine, Olive oil, Pepper & oregano, Butter, Boneless veal cutlets, 
Heat oil or butter in a large frying pan until it develops a  fragrance. Meanwhile, pound the cutlets lightly (do not break the  meat), and dip in the seasoned flour.    Pop the cutlets into the pan (in batches if necessary, do not  overcrowd the pan), and brown on both sides.  Remove from the pan and  keep warm.    Pour off the excess fat, leaving just a thin film, and the brown bits  on the bottom of the pan.  Add a healthy glug of wine, and stir  wildly until the browned bits come off the bottom and begin to  dissolve. Add chicken broth, and continue cooking, stirring, until  reduced by half (you only want a couple of tablespoons of sauce per  serving). Add the juice of a fresh lemon, salt, pepper and oregano to  taste. Pour the sauce over the cutlets, and serve.    We like this with pasta dressed with a little butter or olive oil and  Parmesan cheese, and a steamed green vegetable.    Sorry there are no quantities here -- I just toss stuff in the general  direction of the saute pan and keep cooking until it looks right.    If you really want to get fancy, cut a lemon into thin slices and use  the slices to garnish the meat.  A sprinkling of parsley wouldnt hurt  anything, either....
