Apples and Buttons (Schnitz Un Knepp)
Flour, Baking Powder, Brown sugar, milk, Pepper, Salt, Ham, Butter, Egg, well beaten, Apple, dried, 
*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a  whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours if  using a cooked ham. Pick over and wash dried apples. Cover with water and  let soak over night or for a number of hours. In the morning, cover ham  with cold water and let boil for 3 hours. Add the apples and water in which  they have been soaked and continue to boil for another hour. Add brown  sugar. Make dumplings by sifting together the flour, salt, pepper and  baking powder. Stir in the beaten egg, milk (enough to make fairly moist,  stiff batter), and melted butter. Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot  liquid with the ham and apples. Cover kettle tight and cook dumplings for  15 minutes. Serve piping hot on large platter. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch  Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes, Culinary Arts Press, 1936.
