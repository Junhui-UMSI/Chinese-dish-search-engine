This recipe from from the 2/6/98 issue of the Palo Alto Weekly newspaper -  It sounds promising.    Skin the salmon fillet and remove the pin bones (usually 20-50) with  needle-nose pliers. Place the fillet skin side down in a two-inch deep  metal baking pan. Squeeze lemon juice onto the fish. Cover the fillet with  the lemons, onions, parsley, basil, thyme, oregano, garlic powder and onion  powder. Pour the wine and water into the pan. Cover the pan with plastic  wrap, then with aluminum foil. Bake at 375-400 degrees for about 30  minutes. Check the fillet with a meat thermometer; when it reaches 130-140  degrees, remove and cool for 15-20 minutes.    Remove foil and plastic wrap. Remove the pieces of lemon and onion and  drain juices. The salmon should be light pink. To remove from baking pan,  tightly cover the pan with fresh plastic wrap and flip the pan onto the  plastic wrap. Flip the fillet again from the wrap onto a serving tray.    Garnish with Italian parsley, tomato roses or thin lemon slices.  Refrigerate for at least one hour. Serve cold with Creamy Dill Sauce.
