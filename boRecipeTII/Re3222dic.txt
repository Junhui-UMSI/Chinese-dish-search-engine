1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 10-inch springform pan.    2. For pear and streusel topping, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large  skillet over high heat. Add pears; cook, stirring often, until they are  tender and browned at the edges, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of  the sugar over, cook 1 more minute, then remove from heat; set aside.    3. Crush cookies into coarse crumbs in a food processor or with a rolling  pin.  Add 3 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons flour; mix well. Add  remaining 2 tablespoons butter and mix with processor or a pastry blender  until butter is the size of small peas; set aside.    4. For cake, beat  1/2 cup butter and the sugar with an electric mixer on  high speed until light. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each  addition.  Pour in cream and vanilla; mix well. Stop mixer and add flour,  baking soda and salt; fold in gently.    5. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Arrange pears in a spoke design on top;  sprinkle with crumb mixture. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center  comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
