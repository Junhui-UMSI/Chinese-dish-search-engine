Pumpkin Seed Dip (Sikil-Pak)
(6 oz-each) tomatoes;, (heaping) chopped chives, Unhulled raw pumpkin seeds, Tortilla chips, Chile habanero; or any fresh, Hulled raw pumpkin seeds, Salt, (heaping) chopped coriander, Cold water; approximately, MAKES 1.5 CUPS, 
Heat a thick frying pan or comal and toast the seeds, turning them  constantly, until the hulls are well browned and crisp (some types of seeds  will start to pop open). Add the hulled pumpkin seeds and toast for one  minute more. Set them aside to cool off. Meanwhile, toast the chile,  turning it from time to time until it is blistered and black-brown in  spots.    Using an electric coffee/spice grinder, grind the toasted seeds, together  with the salt to a coarse powder. Transfer to a small serving bowl.    Blend the tomatoes briefly with 1/3 cup of the water. Stir into the ground  pumpkin seeds, together with the coriander, chives, and whole chile ( if  you prefer a more picante dish, blend the chile with the tomatoes before  mixing them with the seeds).    Serve it at room temperature, as a dip. The mixture should have the  consistency of mayonnaise. If it is too thick, you may have to add a little  more water to dilute it.    Notes: MENU: 1-Begin your meal with an ancient Mayan dish of Sikil-pak, a  pumpkin seed dip to be served with crisp-fried or toasted tortillas.
