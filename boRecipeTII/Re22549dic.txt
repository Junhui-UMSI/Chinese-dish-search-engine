Appleton Potatoes
Baking potatoes, Sour cream, Strips bacon, cooked, Butter, Green onion, Cheddar cheese, Black Pepper, 
Sometime last week someone (cant remember who, and I already deleted  it....) requested a recipe for some kind of stuffed potato. Im not sure if  this is what he had in mind, but its one of our family favorites. It is  the recipe that was used in the restaurant of the Appleton Inns in  Massachusetts when my father managed them about ten years ago.    Bake the potatoes at 400 degrees for 40 minutes or until tender (I  sometimes "nuke em"). Cut the top quarter off of the potatoes and discard  (or do what you will with them!). Scrape the potato out of the skin and  place in a large bowl. Place the skins on a baking sheet. Sliver the bacon  and add to the potato in the bowl. Add the remaining ingredients into the  bowl and mix to the desired texture. Spoon the mixture back into the potato  skins, piling high. Bake at 400 degrees for another 10-15 minutes, until  light brown.    Posted to EAT-L Digest 10 Sep 96    From:    Melisa Wells <MelisaLW@AOL.COM>    Date:    Wed, 11 Sep 1996 08:45:04 -0400
