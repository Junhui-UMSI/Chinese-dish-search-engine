CIBO Cheese is a goat cheese mixed with cream and other flavorings. I  bought it at an upscale grocery store, in the deli section.    Make the crust:    Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Process flour, salt and butter just  until combined and crumbly in texture. Add water, 2 tablespoons at a time.  Do not overprocess. Press evenly into pan, up 1 1/2 inches at the side.  Allow to chill while making the filling.    Make the filling:    Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    Combine CIBO goat cheese, ricotta, butter, eggs (adding one at a time,  processing well after each addition), flour, salt and pepper. Pour filling  into shell, bake until puffed and brown for 25-30 minutes.
