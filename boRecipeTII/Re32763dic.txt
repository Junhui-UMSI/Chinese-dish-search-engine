Sweet Potato Oven Fries or Parsnip Oven Fries Or Carrot Ove
Oil, Sweet potatoes, Salt to taste, Nonstick olive oil, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Peel and cut the sweet potatoes in 1/4-inch  sticks. Spray a baking sheet with the nonstick vegetable oil spray and  arrange the potatoes in one layer on a baking sheet, spray potatoes with  vegetable oil. These are basically almost fat free. However, you can skip  the second spraying and put the sweet potatoes, parsnips and/or carrots in  a bowl and toss with 1 to 2 tablespoons oil. Bake them in a preheated oven  for 15 to 20 minutes, toss frequently, and bake them for an additional 10  minutes or until just golden. Sprinkle with salt or seasonings of your  choice. NOTE: These tend to turn burn and edges turn black because of the  sugar content, so watch very carefully.    Makes 4 servings.
