I know there are other recipes in the archives, but this one is (I  believe) different from all of them.    Combine TVP, soy sauce, worcestersire sauce and water in a bowl and let set  until the loquid is absorbed.    Dice the onion and green pepper, and "sautee" in liquid of your choice.  When the onion has started to brown a little, add the TVP and any remaining  liquid.    Slightly mash the beans and add to the TVP/onions. Add barbeque sauce of  your choice. I use either homemade BBQ sauce, or a spicey brand like KC  aAsterpiece. Sometimes I make it a little less spicey for the kids by using  half spicey BBQ sauce and half catsup.    Mix well, season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Simmer for  at least 5 minutes to heat everything through. Serve on hamburger buns.    Makes enough for about 8 sandwiches.
