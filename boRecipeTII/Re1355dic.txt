Easy Garlic Tomato Soup (Ww)
Olive oil, extra virgin, Garlic, , Paprika, Tomato, Water, Salt & pepper, Tabasco sauce, Butter, Bread, french, Parmesan cheese, 
Heat olive oil in a stew pot.      Saute garlic until oil is infused. Raise heat slightly, add paprika.  Saute until paprika just begins to sizzle. Add tomatoes (you can puree some  of them for a smoother soup), water or broth, and salt; simmer 20 minutes.  If using fresh tomatoes, add additional salt. Add a few dashes of black  pepper if you like.       Butter slices of bread liberally. Press one side of each piece into the  grated parmesan. Broil until toasty, watching to make sure the parmesan  doesnt crisp.       Reduce heat on the soup. Add a few dashes of Tabasco sauce--its  generally three to five dashes in my house--and serve by placing one  crouton in each bowl and covering with soup.      Serves 6.
