Watergate Salad #5
Carton (8 oz) cool whip, Mini marshmallows, Pecans, (3/4 oz) pistachio instant, (8 oz) crushed pineapple, 
In large bowl, mix pudding and pineapple/juice with spatula. Mix in cool  whip. Fold in marshmallows and pecans. Refrigerate.    Maraschino cherries and or coconut may also be added for variations. You  can also add 2 drops of green food coloring if you so desire. I have even  made it without the pecans since there are already some nuts in the  pudding.
