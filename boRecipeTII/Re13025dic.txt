Add the squash and continue to saute for 2 minutes. Season the  mixture with salt and pepper. Stir in the garlic and rice and continue to  saute for 1 minute. Stir in the stock and bring to a boil. Season the  mixture with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 18  minutes, stirring constantly, or until the rice is tender and creamy. Stir  in the butter, cream and 1/2 cup of the cheese. Fold in the shredded duck  and basil. Season the risotto with salt and pepper.    To serve, spoon the risotto into shallow bowls and garnish with the  remaining cheese, cracklings, and Spicy Pumpkin Seeds.
