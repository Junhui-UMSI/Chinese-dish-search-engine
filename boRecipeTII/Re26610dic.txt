Garlic, Unsalted butter, Heavy cream, Cayenne pepper, flat anchovies , 
1. In a heavy saucepan, simmer cream with 2 garlic cloves until reduced to        1    cup.    2. Place reduced cream, anchovies and cayenne in blender and puree.    3. Bring sauce to a simmer and add butter, stirring until melted.    4. Serve in a hot chafing dish accompanied with chilled, raw vegetables and  homemade (if possible) sourdough `grissini. TIP: If butter and cream  separate, pour in a bit of cold cream and whisk hard. The sauce will regain  its velvety texture. This is a dish to be enjoyed without ceremony. Pick up  vegetables or breadsticks - grissini - with your fingers and dip into the  sauce until well covered; consume.    GENOA    S.E. BELMONT, PORTLAND.
