BATTER:    Prepare pastry mix according to package directions for  one crust unbaked pie shell.  Line an 8" square cake  pan with pastry.  Spread with raspberry jam. Cream  butter and sugar together thoroughly.  Add eggs,  beating until light and fluffy.  Add flour and salt;  blend well. Divide batter in half. Color half pink and  half green.  Put small spoonfuls of each mixture  alternately on jam layer.  Tap pan gently on counter  to even out the batter.  Bake in a 350 F oven for  35-40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in centre  comes out clean. Cool completely. Beat frosting  ingredients together until smooth and creamy, adding  enough icing sugar to make a spreading consistency.  Spread over cooled squares. Makes about 2 dozen bars.
