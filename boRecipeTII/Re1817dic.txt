It was only when I grew up and made it myself that I realized what a  sophisticated yet easy dish it was.  My mom always doubled the recipe to  feed our large gang and I think it freezes good as well. No idea where the  recipe originated, though it more than likely was taken from a 60s copy of  Womens Day magazine.
