Lightly salt and pepper inside of bird(s). Roll in flour to coat. Slowly  brown bird on all sides. Remove bird to Dutch oven. Add flour to pan  drippings. Cook and stir until brown. Add water, salt, and pepper. Cook and  stir until thickened. I usually make 4-5 cups of gravy.    Stuff cavities with apple, onion, and chunked potato. Put potatoes and  onions around bird. Pour gravy over all. Cover. Bake slowly 3 1/2 - 4 hours  or until the meat is falling off the bones -- tender and moist. Serve 1/2  duck to each person or slice goose. Pass potatoes, onions and gravy.
