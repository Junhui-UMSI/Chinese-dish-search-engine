The Ultimate M&m Cookies
Vanilla, Flour, Baking soda, Eggs, Brown sugar, Sugar, Butter, Salt, 
You need an electric mixer for these to come out perfectly. Combine the two  sugars. Add the butter and beat until light and fluffy (this step is very  important, and could take about 5 minutes). Add the eggs, one at a time,  beat first on low speed, then on high speed until completely incorporated  (not "curdled"). Add the vanilla and beat again on low, then high. Add the  flour mixed with baking soda and salt in 2-3 batches. After each addition,  beat on low until incorporated, then on high for a few seconds to fluff it  up. You end up with a very fluffy batter. Fold in M&Ms or chocolate chips.  If the batter is too loose, you can add a little more flour, or  refrigerate. Drop by tablespoonful onto cookie sheet (I roll them in my  hands into balls so they melt into perfect circles).    Bake at 375F for about 8 minutes. Take them out when they just start to  turn brown. This way they will be crispy on outside and chewy on inside.  Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by cindy.entis@pharma.Novartis.com on Apr 30,  1998
