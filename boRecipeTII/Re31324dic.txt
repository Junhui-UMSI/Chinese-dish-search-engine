The name of this dish, one which I believe comes from Scotland and  therefore is not the proper Indian name at all, refers to the fact that the  bread is turned. This bread has a nice flavor and it is not complicated to  make.      Mix the dry ingredients together well. Cut in the shortening using a  pastry blender. Mix in the water and knead until the dough is very smooth,  about 15 minutes. You can do this in much less time with a powerful  electric mixer such as a KitchenAid.      Grease a black frying pan, including the sides, and press the dough into  the pan. Bake on top of the stove over low heat. Watch carefully so that  the bread does not brown or burn before the center is cooked. When the  bread is free from the pan, turn the loaf over and continue to cook. The  total cooking time will be about l0 minutes on each side.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
