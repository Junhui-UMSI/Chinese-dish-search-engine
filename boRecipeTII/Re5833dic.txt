Pioneer Macaroni and Cheese

Now, one of my favorite mac and cheeses is an old-fashioned one from the  original Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook. It does not have the creaminess of  a sauced version, but if you try it, youll find it has its own  attractions, quite different flavor, blander, but equally satisfying.    Cook macaroni until al dente. In a buttered 12x7 1/2x2" baking dish, layer  in alternate layers the cooked macaroni, dots of butter, cheese cubes,  salt, pepper. Pour milk over all and sprinkle top with paprika. Bake at 350  degrees about 40 minutes, until golden brown on top. You can garnish it, if  desired, with parsley springs, pimiento strips, pepper rings, etc.    Posted to FOODWINE Digest  by "Joanne L. Schweikj" <SCHWEIKJ@FREDONIA.EDU>  on Jan 4, 1998
