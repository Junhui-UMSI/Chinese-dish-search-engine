Fresh Cranberry Relish
Or so of orange juice;, Zest from 1 big orange;, Juice from orange after you, Zest from 1 big lemon;, Juice from lemon after you, Bag of cranberries plus, Sugar depending on just how, Diced pecans, 
Put all ingredients in appropriate sized pot on stove, place on medium to  medium high heat and stir until all sugar is dissolved. Keep a very close  eye b/c of all the sugar, it can get icky quickly if heat is too high.  Cranberries will begin to pop (YEA) and it will begin to bubble. Keep it  cooking at the steady bubble level and keep stirring. You dont want it to  burn or stick. It takes a good 20 or 30 minutes of cooking for it to reduce  to an almost chutney or jam-like level. It is awesome!!    To make it more orang-y coarsely dice up an orange or two and cook with  cranberries. The cooking will render them to a pulpy stage. You can also  add cinnamon or cloves to it for seasoning, but I prefer the clean taste  without. It is great hot or cold.    Posted to fatfree digest by "Felicia K.
