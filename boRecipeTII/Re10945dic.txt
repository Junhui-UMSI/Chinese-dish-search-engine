Rack of Lamb Persillade (Mf)
Garlic, Shallots, olive oil, Fresh rosemary, chopped, Salt, Parsley, Rack lamb, Fresh bread crumbs, 
Blanched sugar snap peas tossed in butter as an accompaniment    Pre-heat the oven to 475 degrees. In a small skillet heat the oil over  moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the garlic and cook it,  stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the shallots and the rosemary and cook the  mixture, stirring, for 10 seconds. Stir in the parsley and breadcrumbs and  season with salt and pepper. Remove the skillet from heat.    Heat another oven-proof skillet over moderately high heat until it is hot  and brown the lamb, seasoned with salt and pepper, turning it, for 5  minutes, or until the sides and ends are browned evenly. Pour off any fat  from the skillet, arrange the lamb, and pat the crumb mixture evenly on the  fat and the meat sides of the lamb.    Bake the lamb in the middle of the oven for 15 minutes, or until a meat  thermometer registers 130 degrees for medium-rare meat. Transfer the lamb  to platter and let it stand, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Serve with buttered  sugar snap peas.
