Carefully remove the husks of each ear of corn, taking care not to rip the  widest husks. Select the 24 widest husks and set aside, covered with damp  paper towels. Cut 2 of the remaining husks into 8 long strips and reserve,  covered with damp paper towels. Cut the corn kernels from each cob and  reserve.    In a large bowl whisk together the lime juice, garlic, jalapeno, cumin and  cayenne. Slowly add 6 tablespoons olive oil in a stream, whisking  constantly. Add the corn, potatoes, black beans, red bell pepper and season  with salt and pepper, tossing to combine and coat with the dressing. Taste  and adjust seasoning if necessary. Add the cilantro leaves, stirring to  combine.    Place 2 corn husks, concave side up, on a work surface, overlapping them at  the wider ends by 2 inches. Center a third husk on top to the first two  husks. Arrange about a 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture in the center of  the husks. Fold the sides of the corn husks up and over the filling to  cover it completely. Tie at either end with a corn husk strip to secure the  filling, forming a cigar-shaped packet. Make more packets in the same  manner with the remaining ingredients. Packets can be made up to 4 hours in  advance.    Preheat grill or grill pan.    Brush the packets with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and grill each  packet for 6 minutes per side, covered. If desired, cut each packet open  and sprinkle grated cheese over vegetables. Return packets to grill or  broil until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
