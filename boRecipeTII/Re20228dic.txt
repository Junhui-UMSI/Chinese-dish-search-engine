Veal and Oyster Collops,
Breadcrumbs, Lemon slices; for garnish, Fillet of veal, Butter, Fresh oysters, Seasoned flour, Egg, 
Cut the veal into eight equal slices, each about 2-3 cm (1") thick. Remove  the oysters from their shells and reserve the liquid. Cut a slit in each  piece of veal with the point of a sharp knife, and stuff with two oysters.  Dust with seasoned flour, brush with beaten egg and coat with breadcrumbs.  Fry in butter until the meat is tender and the outside golden brown.    Make a gravy with the pan juices and the reserved oyster liquid. Pour over  the veal and garnish with lemon slices. Sauteed potatoes and wilted spinach  or green beans are the perfect accompaniments, or a green salad.

Otherwise use lamb       fillet or       fillet of beef. If you prefer, you can stuff and roast the fillet       whole, carving       it at the table.
