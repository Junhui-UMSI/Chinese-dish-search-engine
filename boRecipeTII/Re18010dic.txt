For those of you who hate to  cook (like me), this is super easy and really tasty!    Warm tortillas in microwave for about 20 seconds. Place 2 slices of  cucumber, 3 slices of tomato, a couple of pieces of Feta, a few slices of  onions and a big glop of sour cream down the middle of the tortilla. Salt  and pepper to taste, wrap in wax paper like a cone, twist the bottom so the  juice doesnt run down your arm and enjoy!    You could use FF tzatziki (sp?) instead of the sour cream but that makes it  very stinky and I have to meet with people all day!    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #43    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
