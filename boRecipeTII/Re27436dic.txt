Cook at low heat, stirring  constantly until it reaches 212 degrees. STOP STIRRING until candy reaches  236 degrees. Add the walnuts and stir constantly until candy reaches 290  degrees. Remove from heat and add soda, stirring well. Pour onto buttered  cookie sheet.   Immediately cut into squares. Will run back together, but can be cracked  where cut. Add dipping chocolate wafers on top. They will melt & you can  spread them out. Sprinkle nuts on top (opt.) Dolores McCann, OH
