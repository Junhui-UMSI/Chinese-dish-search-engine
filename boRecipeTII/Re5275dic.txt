Pina Colada Fruit Dip
Crushed pineapple in its juices  , milk, Sour Cream, instant coconut, 
In food processor bowl with metal blade or blender container, combine all  ingredients.  Cover; process 30 seconds.  Refrigerate for several hours or  overnight to blend flavors.  Serve with fresh fruit. Makes 2 1/2 cups. I  serve it usually in a pineapple that Ive split in half lengthwise and  hollowed out.    Another good dip is simply caramel ice cream topping.  Serve with sliced  apples in the Fall is really a nice treat    Recipe By     : Jeanne Hinds    Posted to EAT-L Digest 25 Sep 96    Date:    Wed, 25 Sep 1996 16:37:41 -0500    From:    LD Goss <ldgoss@METRONET.COM>
