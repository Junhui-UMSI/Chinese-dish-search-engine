*Baileys Original Irish Creme gets its flavor from a blend of Irish  whiskey and fresh cream, which is delivered daily to the Dublin plant that  makes the liqueur. This dessert is packed with chocolate and rich flavor.  Using all semisweet chocolate will yield a deeper, darker fudge.    FUDGE: Melt all chips with butter until they are soft enough to stir  smooth. Do not overheat. Add chocolate/butter mixture to powdered sugar and  Baileys. Stir until smooth. Add nuts, if desired. Mix well.    Place fudge in an 8-inch square pay sprayed with vegetable spray. Lay a  sheet of plastic wrap on top and gently press to smooth fudge.    TOPPING: Melt chips until smooth. Remove from heat. With a fork, beat in  butter and Baileys until smooth.    Spread topping over fudge with a knife. If a very smooth top is desired,  use a piece of plastic as done on fudge.    Refrigerate until firm, 1 to 2 hours. Can be frozen. Makes 64 pieces.    Source: Oregonian FoodDay; typos by Dorothy Flatman 1997
