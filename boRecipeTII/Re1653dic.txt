Carribean Crock
Bag 16 oz dry beans, Left over rib bones (knawed), Onions, chopped, Green onions, chopped, Green beans, fresh! whole, Chinese 5 spice, 
Simply delicious!  If you love baked beans but cant take the sugar levels,  this is for you.  The meat is optional but a nice touch.  The dried beans  can be almost any type, but suggested are:  Kidney, red beans, pink beans,  pinto, black beans, or a mix of the above for a true fiesta pot.    Just dump it all in and let it cook.    Optional additions are:  Pretty colored peppers added near the end of the  cooking cycle, fresh tomatos (Italian work best due to firmness), ripe  black olives (dont use green), pecans, whole grapes.    Serve this with thin toasted slices of baby bagels or a rye toast, and just  a hint of fine white cheese such as gryere or brie.    Nutritionally complete, low in fat, low in sodium pending on the additions,  suitable for diabetics and dieters.
