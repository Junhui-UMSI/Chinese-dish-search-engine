Quick Lentil-Kale Soup
Carrot, Chopped parsley, Bay leaf, Pepper, Water, kale, Lentils, Ground thyme, Onion, Tomatoes, Soy miso, Celery, 
Cook for about 30 to 60 minutes the lentils in a heavy pot (beans tend to  stick to the sides of thin pots).     While the lentils are cooking briefly saute the onions in water and add  parsley, bay leaf.  When onions are soft add the celery.  Stir for about 2  minutes then add the carrots.  Briefly saute until the carrots are brighter  in colour but still a little crunchy. Add the lentils and tomatoes and stir  the kale into the lentils. Keep stirring.     When the kale is wilted, add water and the rest of the seasoning.  Simmer  the soup for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Serves about 4 to 6.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
