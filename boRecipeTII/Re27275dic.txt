The following substitute works well. Be sure you  use firm or stale lady fingers so it doesnt get mushy.    Beat heavy cream with sugar until stiff. Set aside.  Using same beater,  beat together ricotta, sugar and sour cream. Gently fold cream and cheese  mixes together; add rum. Arrange half the ladyfingers in a 2 or 2 1/2 inch  deep oval or rectangular serving dish large enough to hold the lady fingers  in a single layer (approximately 8" x 8"), quickly dipping each lady finger  in espresso before putting it in the pan. Top with half of the cream and  cheese mixture. Top with the remaining ladyfingers (dipped in coffee) and  top with remaining cream and cheese mixture. When set, top with unsweetened  cocoa.
