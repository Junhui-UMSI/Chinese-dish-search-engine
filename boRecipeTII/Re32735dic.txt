Sweet Potato Crisp
Granny Smith apples, peeled,, 4 -inch sl, Sweet potatoes or yams,, Unsalted butter, Melted unsalted butter, Salt, Cinnamon, Freshly ground white pepper, 
1) Preheat the oven to 350. Butter ten 3-inch nonstick tart pans.    2) In a 10-inch skillet, melt the 2 tablespoons butter.  Over medium-high  heat, saute the apples until lightly caramelized, 6 to 8 minutes.    3) Place the sweet potatoes in a medium bowl and season with salt,  cinnamon, and pepper. Pour 1/4 cup melted butter over and mix well. In each  tart pan, arrange a layer of potatoes in a circle, one slice overlapping  the other. Divide the apples equally, place on top, and cover with the  remaining potatoes, again in a circle, one slice overlapping the other.  Pour a little of the remaining 1/4 cup melted butter into each pan. For  easier handling, set the pans on a baking tray and bake crispy, 30 to 35  minutes. Invert the pans of potatoes onto the baking tray and if the  underside has not browned, return to the oven for about 5 minutes longer.  Serve immediately.    NOTE: These can be arranged directly on a baking tray if tart pans are not  available.    To prepare ahead:  In step 3, bake the crisps for about 20 minutes,  finishing the baking at serving time.    *Both recipes taken from: Adventures in the Kitchen, by Wolfgang Puck,  Random House, 1991.
