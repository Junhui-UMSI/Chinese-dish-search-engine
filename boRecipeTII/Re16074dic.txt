To make Yellow Tomato Salsa, in a food processor, using steel blade,  process tomatoes until well chopped. Dont puree. Combine tomatoes and  their juices with shallot, garlic, cilantro, vinegar, chilies, lime juice,  salt, and mix well. Add maple syrup, if needed, to balance flavor and  slightly sweeten. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until very  cold.    To make taco, fill large stock pot with lightly salted water and bring to a  boil over high heat.  Add lobsters and cook for about 8 minutes or until  just done. Drain and let lobsters cool slightly. Remove meat from lobster  tails, careful not to tear it apart. Cut meat into thin medallions (or  medium size dice, if meat breaks apart). Heat oil in medium saute pan, over  medium heat and saute lobster medallions until just heated through. Spoon  equal portions warm lobster medallions into center of each warm flour  tortilla. Sprinkle each with equal portions of grated cheese and shredded  spinach.  Roll into cylinder shape and place each one on warm serving plate  with the edge facing bottom. Surround the taco with Yellow Tomato Salsa.
