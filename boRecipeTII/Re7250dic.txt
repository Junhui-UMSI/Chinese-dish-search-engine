Pork Burritos a la Jennifer
El Pato sauce; yellow can, Salt, Optional: heat increases to, Roast pork; cubed (we used, Garlic; chopped, lots, Onion; sliced, 
We use a non-stick pan and just the fat contained in the roast.  Brown the  meat for about 8 minutes, then add the onion and cumin and brown about 7  minutes more or as you like it.  If you are adding hot peppers I would put  them in during this time. Also, Jenn leaves the lid on during this and it  seems to help make everything more flavorful.  Add the garlic at the end  and toss to mix. Add the El Pato and simmer, covered, for about 5 minutes,  let rest about 10 minutes to thicken and mellow. Roll in tortillas with you  favorite extras (cheese, lettuce, etc.) Enjoy! Richard & Jennifer Trump  <HotHeads@aol.com>    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
