Raspberry-Lemon Verbena Butter
Handful young, tender lemon, Unsalted butter, verbena leaves, Fresh or frozen raspberries, Sugar; or to taste, not in syrup, 
Thaw raspberries if frozen, and pour off any excess liquid.    With all ingredients at room temperature, blend butter, sugar and  raspberries until smooth.  This may take a while (about three minutes in a  food processor), and you may think its never going to emulsify, but it  will if you persist.  Strip out any large veins in the lemon verbena  leaves, then add the leaves (chopped if youre mixing by hand) and blend  until the texture is pleasing.    Alley notes that "this delightfully sweet and fragrant butter is excellent  on muffins, pancakes or waffles."    From Lynn Alleys "Herbs in Butter" article in "The Herb Companion."
