Warm Cheese Croutons
Cotija cheese, olive oil, 
Cotija, an Hispanic-style cheese, softens but does not melt when heated. It  can make a deliciously different crouton for salads and soups and doesnt  need breading.    To prepare, cut leftover cheese into small cubes, saute briefly in a  preheated nonstick skillet with olive oil until browned on all sides, 1  minute to 2 minutes.    Pop them into your favorite salad or soup just before serving. A dash of  hot pepper sauce before serving will add some zing to this mild cheese.
