Another from Pampered Chef. This would be a good way to use up overripe  bananas! Stacy    Preheat oven to 350F. Grease bottom only of loaf pan. In a large bowl,  combine pound cake mix, milk, banana and eggs; mix well. Stir in coconut.  Pour into loaf pan. Bake 55-60 minutes or until cake tester inserted in  center comes out clean. Cool on rack for 15 minutes; remove from pan & cool  completely.    Serving ideas: Top with sliced kiwifruit and top with vanilla ice cream and  a tablespoon of apricot preserves or orange marmalade.    *For added tropical taste, add 1 teaspoon rum extract to cake batter    Posted to brand-name-recipes by Barbra<barbra@pipeline.com> on Feb 18, 1998
