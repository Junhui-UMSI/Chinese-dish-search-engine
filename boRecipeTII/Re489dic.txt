made this pound cake last night and it was yummy! The recipe below if for a  small bundt pan, but can be doubled for a large pan, just bake longer-about       60    minutes    For cake, cream sugar and margarine together. Add yogurt and eggs. Add dry  ingredients and mix well. Pour in pammed small size bundt pan and bake  about 45 minutes at 325 until lightly browned. Mix lemon glaze by putting  all ingredients except the lemon juice together. Add just enough lemon  juice to get a pourable consistency. Cool cake 10 min in pan, then invert  and cool the rest of the way. Pour lemon glaze over cooled cake. About 8-10  servings. (8 servings is about 3.5 grams per serving, I figure.)
