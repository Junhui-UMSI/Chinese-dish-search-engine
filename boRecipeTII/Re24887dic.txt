Australian Grilled Fish
Vegetable oil, Fresh ginger root, Black pepper, Dijon mustard, Lime juice, Cayenne pepper, Fish steaks, 
* For the steaks: they should be 8-10 ounces and 1-inch thick each. Use  Swordfish, Halibut or Salmon steaks.    1. In a bowl, combine the lime juice, 1 tablespoon oil, ginger, cayenne  pepper and enough freshly ground black pepper to suit your taste. 2.  Marinate the fish in the marinade for 45-60 minutes. Turn steaks 2-3 times.  3. Have the grill prepared with white coals and brush the cooking grill  with the remaining one tablespoon oil. 4. Grill the fish, brushing several  times with the marinade, until cooked through and opaque in the center.  Turn fish after about 4-5 minutes. Total grilling time will depend on your  grill and the heat of the coals.    * To broil instead, use a broiler pan brushed with oil and broil until  center is opaque. Will take about 10 minutes total in broiler. Turn steaks  after 5 minutes, and baste often with marinade.
