Add onions, saute until just tender. Add thyme, reduce heat to  medium and cook until onions are golden, stirring often. Add garlic and  saute two minutes. Add 1/4 cup wine, stir until almost all liquid has  evaporated. Sprinkle sugar over onions and saute until soft and brown. Add  remaining wine and stir till liquid evaporates. Season to taste with salt  and pepper.    2.  On lightly floured board, roll out pastry to 1/8" thickness.  Transfer  to a baking sheet.    3.  Halve Brie horizontally.  Place one half of Brie, cut side up, in  middle of pastry. Top with caramelized onions. Cover with other half of  Brie, cut side down.    4.  Draw pastry up around brie, holding corners.  Tuck edges in and twist  corners together to form bundle.    5.  Beat egg yolk with 1 tsp water and brush on pastry, avoiding edges.    6.  Bake at 425o for 20 minutes or until golden and puffed.  Let Brie stand  in pan on rack for 20 minutes for runny cheese or 40 minutes for thicker  cheese.    EAT-L Digest 16 July 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
