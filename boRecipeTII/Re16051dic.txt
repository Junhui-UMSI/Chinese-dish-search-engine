Warm Chocolate Souffle Cakes
Eggs, Bittersweet chocolate, Butter, Granulated Sugar, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter (or spray with nonstick vegetable  spray) 12 4-ounce souffle cups. Melt chocolate and butter in a large bowl  over a pan of simmering water. Separate eggs into 2 bowls. Whisk the yolks  with 3/4 cup sugar until pale yellow and sugar is dissolved. Whisk egg  whites with 1/2 cup sugar until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1/2 cup  sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.    Gently stir egg yolk mixture into chocolate mixture. Fold chocolate mixture  into egg whites in 3 or 4 batches. Pour into souffle cups and bake for 12 -  14 minutes, or until puffed and dry on top. Serve immediately.    NOTES : These souffles can be made ahead and refrigerated before baking at  the last minute.
