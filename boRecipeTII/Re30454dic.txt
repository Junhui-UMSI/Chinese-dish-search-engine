I found this recipe in the Chicago Tribune a few years ago and have had  good reviews from my family. Id also stud it with mini-chocolate chip  morsels after it cools off.    1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sift together the  flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.    2. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until  light, 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla, mixing well  after each addition. Stop the mixer and add the bananas. Mix lightly. fold  in the dry ingredients and nuts, mixing just until combined.    3. Transfer batter to prepared pan. Bake until toothpick inserted in the  center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes  then invert onto a wire rack. Cool completely. Sprinkle chocolate chip  morsels on top, if desired, before slicing. Posted to KitMailbox Digest by  "Marella Good" <mgood@wwa.com> on Jul 29, 1997
