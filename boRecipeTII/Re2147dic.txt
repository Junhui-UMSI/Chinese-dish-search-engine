Apricot Foldovers
Grated sharp cheddar cheese, Water, Apricot preserves, Margarine; softened, Flour, Sugar, 
Cream the margarine and cheese, then blend in the flour and water. Chill  the dough for 4 to 5 hours. Preheat the oven to 370F. In a medium saucepan  over medium heat, heat the preserves and sugar until the mixture boils and  is smooth. Set aside. Divide the dough in half. Roll each half into a 10  inch square, cut into 2 1/2 inch squares. Put 1 teaspoon of the preserves  in the center of each square, fold over and seal the edges. Bake on an  ungreased cookie sheet for 8 to 10 minutes. Makes about 2 1/2 dozen.
