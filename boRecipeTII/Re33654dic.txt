Cinnamon, Butter, Ground nuts, Milk, Powdered sugar, Brown sugar, Almond extract, Vanilla extract, ICING, FILLING, Butter, dough, 
Make same dough as Buttery Dinner Rolls, through first rise.    On a lightly floured surface, roll and stretch the dough out to a 13 by 20  inch rectangle.  Spread butter over dough, using a knife and/or a stiff  basting brush.  Sprinkle with cinnamon FIRST, then brown sugar and nuts.  Try to spread filling right to the short ends. Beginning at the long side,  roll up jelly-roll style as many turns as possible. Pinch the long edge of  the dough into the roll.    Shape into a circular ring on a greased pizza pan or cookie sheet. If  filling doesnt come right to the end of the roll, consider snipping off a  bit of the end with a pair of scissors. Join the ends of the roll, using a  bit of water.  With scissors, make cuts along the outside edge 1/2 to 3/4  way through the ring at 1 to 1-1/2 inch intervals. Turn each section on its  side (at a slant). Can be covered and refrigerated at this point to hold.    Cover and let rise until doubled, 30 minutes or more.  Preheat oven to 375  F.  When ring goes in the oven, turn down to 350 F. Bake 20 to 30 minutes  at 350 F.    Mix icing until smooth and the consistency of heavy cream. Drizzle on the  hot Tea Ring with a teaspoon.    Note:  Can cut red and/or green maraschino cherries in half and place one  half on each section of the ring -- a nice Christmas touch.
