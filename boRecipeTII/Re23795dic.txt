Re the request for a black-eyed pea recipe, this one was in the Los Angeles  Times holiday section today. I havent tried it, but it sounded good. It  doesnt have any meat, but it does have fish. For this reason, it might be  more "non-bean-eater friendly."    Soak black-eyed peas in water to cover overnight. Drain. Add water to  cover, bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. Drain and reserve  cooking liquid. Set aside.    Pour oil in large pot. Add onion, cayenne, curry powder, seasoned salt and  salt to taste and cook over medium-high heat until onion begins to brown, 5  to 7 minutes. Add tomato slices and cook 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste.  Stir in 1/2 cup water and simmer 5 minutes. Add salmon, including juice,  and break into bite-size pieces with back of wooden spoon. Simmer 3  minutes.    Add black-eyed peas and reserved cooking liquid and water if necessary to  make 4 to 5 cups. Simmer 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook 20 minutes. Add  more reserved cooking water if needed to keep stew moist but not soupy.  Season with salt to taste. Serve over rice.    8 servings. Each serving without rice: 357 cal; 307 mg sodium; 26 mg  cholesterol; 8 g fat; 43 g carbohydrates; 31 g protein; 3.71 g fiber; 20%  CFF.    Maybe Ill try cooking it for New Years. Who can say no to good luck?    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n323 by bgaerlan@ucla.edu (Barbara Gaerlan) on  Dec 21, 1997
