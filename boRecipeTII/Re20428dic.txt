Salt and let  stand the aubergines for 2 hours.  Rinse well and fry in some  olive oil. Boil the potatoes for a couple of minutes and then fry in some  olive oil till tender.    Fry onions in the olive oil and add the garlic and courgettes. Add the soya  mince which  should have previously been rehydrated with some olive oil and  some vegetable stock.  Add the tomatoes and finally add the pine kernels  and the cheese.  You may like to add some herbs here, though this wasnt  done traditionally.    In a glass  baking dish make layers of aubergines, tomato/mince sauce and  the potatoes  mixed with the white sauce. Make sure the top layer is a  potato/white sauce mix.    Bake in the oven for about 25 minutes at about 300 degrees F.    From: Jim Porter                      Date: 05-13-93
