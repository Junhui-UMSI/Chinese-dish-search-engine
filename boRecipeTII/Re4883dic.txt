Chinese cabbage, Water, Sherry, Salt, Szechwan peppercorns, 
1. Cut cabbage stems in 1/2- by 2-inch strips. (Save the green leaves  for soups or stir-fried dishes.) Let dry out several hours or overnight;  then place in a large jar.       2. Bring water almost to a boil, then remove from heat. Stir in salt to  dissolve; add Szechwan peppercorns and sherry. Let cool; then pour over  cabbage.       3. Cover and refrigerate 3 days. Before serving, drain cabbage well and  blot with paper toweling.       NOTE: To use marinade a second time, reheat and stir in another teaspoon  of salt.       VARIATIONS: For the Chinese cabbage, substitute string beans; or celery  or carrots, cut in strips about 2 inches long.       In step 1, add 1 or 2 whole dried red peppers to the jar.
