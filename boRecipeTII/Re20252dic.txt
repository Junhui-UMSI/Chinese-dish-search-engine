ESSENCE OF EMERIL SHOW #EE2300    In a medium sauce pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the onions, carrots,  and celery, cook for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and begin  to brown. Dust the vegetables with flour, stir to coat all the vegetables  and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the flour begins to brown. Add the stock,  stirring to incorporate. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-high  and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the sweet potatoes to the gravy and cook  until tender, about 10 minutes. Adjust the seasonings and sweetened to your  liking with the cane syrup. For the chops: Heat a large cast iron skillet  on high heat. Season the veal chops on both sides with the Essence. Add the  veal chops to the hot skillet. Sear for 3-4 minutes or until a nice crust  is formed to seal in the juices. Flip the veal chops, repeating the process  on the other side. Reduce the heat to medium low. Add the gravy to the pan.  As the veal chops cook, continue to coat them with the gravy as well as  flipping them occasionally to insure even cooking. If the gravy is too  thick, add additional stock to thin the gravy. Cook the chops for 10-12  minutes for medium doneness. To assemble, place a mound of the hot mash  potatoes in the center of the plate. Prop the veal chops against the  potatoes. Spoon the gravy over the top of the chop and around the rim.  Garnish with the fried parsnip strips, green onions, and red peppers.    Yield: 4 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 25, 1998
