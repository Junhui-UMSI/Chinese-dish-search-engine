Place tortilla on a flat surface. Slather with beans, add cheese,  olives, onions, whatever else you would like.    3. Roll up and place in a 9x13 baking dish.    4. Continue until all 10 tortillas have been used, and you have a full  baking dish!    5. Pour Enchilada Sauce over the top, covering completely. Garnish with  chopped olives, onions and cheese.    6. Bake in a 325 degree oven for 45 mins or so, until it is bubbly and very  hot!    7. Serve with sour cream.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 271    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
