Apple Butter in a Crock Pot
Vinegar, Sugar, Apples (cooked and mashed), 
Boil applesauce on high heat, then add sugar and vinegar. I hold the  cinnamon until last 1/2 hour because I think it evaporates some. Cook on  high heat (about 4 hours) until the apple butter is as thick as you want it  when you cool and serve.
