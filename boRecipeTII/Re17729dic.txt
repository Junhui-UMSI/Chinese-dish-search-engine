F.&R.Dahl: "This delicate soup, popular 100 years ago, is now unusual. On  no account should it be liquidized at any stage, as that ruins the texture"    Mince the almonds and, using a pestle and mortar, reduce to a paste with  the egg yolks and a little stock, to stop them oiling.    Bring the stock up to simmering point in a saucepan and whisk in the beurre  manie. When that has dissolved, whisk in the almond paste.    Cook gently for 30 minutes.    Strain through a sieve, add the cream, season with salt and pepper, heat  gently and serve.    From: Felicity & Roald Dahl, Memories with food at Gipsy House, Penguin,  1991, ISBN 0-670-83462-9
