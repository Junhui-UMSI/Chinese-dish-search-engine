Cover and let rise until doubled. Deflate the dough,  divide into 4 pieces and form into oval shapes. Cover with buttered plastic  wrap and allow to double, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 425F. Slash  tops of loaves with a razor blade and bake for 30-to-45 minutes.    Makes 4 Loaves    FOR THE RYE STARTER: Mix water and rye flour and let sit all day.
