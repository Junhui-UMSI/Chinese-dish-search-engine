Pluperfect Potatoes
Sour cream, Green Pepper, Pepper, Potatoes; peeled, diced,, Paprika; for garnish, Salt, Onion, Potato soup; undiluted, Celery soup; undiluted, 
Combine all ingredients except paprika in a large bowl. Fold until all are  blended well. Pour into a large, well-greased casserole. Sprinkle with  paprika. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hours, or until center is bubbly.  (Can be baked at 350 or 375 degrees with adjusted cooking times.)    Notes: This can be prepared to the baking stage a couple of days in  advance. One Lister said she made this using a 2 pound bag of defrosted  frozen hash brown potatoes...havent tried that yet, but will. Great dish  for a pot-luck supper...feeds lots of folks fairly inexpensively. I have no  idea where I got this recipe...Ive had it for years and years. Tastes like  a baked potato with sour cream.
