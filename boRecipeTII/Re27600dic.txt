The Best Oatmeal Cookie
Flour, Salt, Sugar, Baking soda, Molasses, Rolled oats, Raisins, Shortening, Nuts, Eggs, Cinnamon, 
From: kathy@col.hp.com (Kathy Lankford)    Date: 15 Dec 1993 16:52:20 GMT  Another item from my favorite Betty Crocker 1950 cookbook.  These are quick  to make and rich and chewy.  The old cookbook notation says a movie star  made these for her daughter.    Mix shortening, sugar, eggs and molasses. Add flour, soda, salt, and  cinnamon.  Stir in oats, nuts and raisins.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls  onto a cookie sheet. Bake 8-10 minutes at 400 degrees.    [Grandma sent me some hickory nuts once.  These cookies are heavenly with  hickory nuts!]    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
