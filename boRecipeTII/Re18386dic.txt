Very Simple Mushroom Soup
Text file, 
Given that morel season is here, I thought I would post a recipe for wild  mushroom soup. This might work with regular mushrooms but Ive only made  them with fresh wild ones. Boletes aka the Porcini to be exact. If you can  get them, they make a simply sublime soup. This recipe is from Joes Book  of Mushroom Cookery.    Clean mushrooms well. Barely cover with water in a saucepan. Turn the heat  on and cover the pot with a tight fitting lid. When the water comes to a  boil, turn it down to a simmer for 10 minutes. The mushrooms will have  given off their liquid and literally made their own soup. For every 2 cups  of liquid, add 1 tsp each of salt and sugar and 1 tbl soy sauce. Add 4-5  scallions, sliced thin and 1/3 cup shoestring potatoes. The soup is  finished when the potatoes are cooked.
