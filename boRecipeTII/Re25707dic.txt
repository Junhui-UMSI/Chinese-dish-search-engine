B/m "Sour" Sourdough
Salt, Water, Yeast, Sugar, Melted margarine, Bread flour, Sourdough starter, 
This basic recipe was from Anna Ellis (DMSD70C). I  substituted oil for the margarine and with some  experimentation, came up with this technique: Put all  ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle.  When the cycle is complete, leave the dough in the pan  for 3 to 4 more hours. Remove dough and squeeze out  gases. Cover with a damp towel and let it rest for 20  or 30 minutes minutes. Sprinkle corn meal on a board  and shape dough into two cylindrical loaves. Place  loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet. Cover again  with the damp towel and allow to rise for another two  hours. At the end of two hours, refrigerate the dough,  still covered, for at least 12 hours (the longer the  better). Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with  water, and let it sit out for 4 hours. Sprinkle again  with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until  brown and crusty.
