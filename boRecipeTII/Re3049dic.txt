Peanut Chile Brittle
Extra hot powdered chile, Shelled peanuts, Sugar, 
Butter a square or rectangular pan.    Melt sugar in a skillet until it turns light brown in color. Quickly add  the peanuts. Remove from heat and cool, stirring constantly for about 4  minutes. Pour into the buttered pan and spread as much as possible. Mark  into squares to help the candy break neatly. Cool completely and break  apart.
