Garlic, Thai Fish Sauce (see recipe;, Finely chopped fresh, White peppercorns; crushed, Shrimp; partially peeled, Wonton skins (3 1/2 inches, Peanut oil, Sweet Garlic Sauce and/or, 
1. Combine the garlic, peppercorns, cilantro, and fish sauce in a bowl. Add  the shrimp, toss well, and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain the  shrimp.    2. Wrap a wonton skin around the center of each, so that the tip and the  tail are exposed. Dip your finger in a little water and dampen the open  edge slightly to seal.    3. Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the prawn  rolls, 6 at a time, and fry 1 minute on each side, until nicely golden.  Drain on a paper towel and repeat with the remaining prawn rolls. Serve  immediately with one or both of the sauces for dipping.    Makes 24 prawn rolls    Note: If youd rather buy fish sauce, it is available in Asian grocery  stores or Asian sections of supermarkets.    (see Video)    Serving Ideas : Prawn Rolls    NOTES : Simple to prepare and delicious tasting, these prawns (shrimp) are  marinated for just 15 minutes in an aromatic blend of garlic, cilantro  roots, white pepper, and fish sauce. Ive wrapped just the middle of the  prawns in wonton skins and let the tails show through decoratively. Serve  hot and crisp as an hors doeuvre with small bowls of Sweet Garlic Sauce  and Indonesian Soy Sauce alongside for dipping. Have a tiny plate at hand  for the tails.
