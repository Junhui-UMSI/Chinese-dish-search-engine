Quick Panettone
All-purpose flour, Mixed candied fruits,, Sugar, Lemon extract, Pine nuts or slivered, Lemon Peel, Anise extract, Golden raisins, Eggs, (1 stick) unsalted butter,, Crushed anise seed, Baking Powder, Salt, milk, 
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Grease a panettone mold. If using an 8-inch  round cake pan instead, grease it well, and cut a 3-inch-wide strip of  brown paper, parchment, or wax paper long enough to go all around the rim  of the pan. Fit the paper onto the inside edge of the pan (the grease will  help make it stand up and stay in place) to make a tall collar. In a large  bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until thick and pale yellow. Beat in the  melted butter, lemon peel, anise seed, nuts, raisins, fruits, and anise and  lemon extracts. In a small bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, and salt and  blend into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk. Turn the mixture  into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 1 hour and 45 minutes, or until the  bread is well browned and tests done. Cool the bread in the pan for 10  minutes, then turn it out onto a rack to finish cooling. To serve, remove  the paper and cut the bread into wedges.    Recipe is from _Quick Breads_ by Beatrice Ojakangas.
