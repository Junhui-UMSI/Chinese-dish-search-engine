Tart Dough
Egg, (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted, Heavy whipping cream, All-purpose flour, Granulated sugar, Salt, 
In a small bowl, mix together the egg and cream. Set aside.    In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and  butter. Using the paddle attachment on low speed, mix in the butter until  is the size of small peas. With the mixer on low speed, add the egg  mixture. Mix the dough just until it is no longer dry-looking. It will  still be loose and crumbly at this point.    Place the dough on the work surface. With your hands, combine and form the  dough into a single ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate  until firm but still malleable.    Rolling and forming the shells:    On a lightly floured work surface roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick.    Yield: 6 4-inch tartlets    When lining tart, be sure to press the dough carefully around the bottom  edges of the pans.    Prebaking shells:    To prebake a frozen or chilled shell line it with parchment paper. Fill the  shell with uncooked rice, beans, or pie weights. (This helps the shell  retain its shape.) Bake the shell in a preheated 350 degree oven until the  edges are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and  the rice, beans, or weights and continue to bake the shell until it is  golden brown all over.    Unbaked shells can be stored for a day in the refrigerator or for several  weeks in the freezer. Once a shell is baked, it should be eaten that day  for maximum freshness and flakiness of the crust  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #362    Recipe by: COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8785    From: "Angele and Jon Freeman" <jfreeman@netusa1.net>    Date: Wed, 1 Jan 1997 10:02:15 -0500
