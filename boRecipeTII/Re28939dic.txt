As soon as water begins to boil, reduce  heat to low; cook, covered, for 20 minutes. Take the rice off the burner  and remove the lid. Let stand for 15 minutes to cool.    Divide rice evenly among 4 plastic sandwich bags. Shake rice to bottom of  bag and roll firmly into logs. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until rolls hold  shape when sliced.    Spicy Peanut Sauce: Meanwhile, in saucepan, whisk together 1- 1/2 cups  water, peanut butter, lemon juice, soy sauce, molasses, hot pepper flakes  and garlic; bring to boil, whisking often. Reduce heat to medium; cook,  whisking, for 10 minutes or until thick enough to coat spoon. Let cool  slightly.    Using sharp knife, slice rice rolls into 1/2-inch pieces. Serve with sauce  for dipping.  Arrange slices on a plate with sliced cucumber, radishes and  carrots to add colour.
