The Best-Pumpkin Pie Crunch
Eggs, Whipped topping, Evaporated milk, Sugar, Salt, Pumpkin; 16 oz, Pumpkin pie spice, Yellow cake mix, Pecans, Butter or Margarine, 
The recipe is absolutely divine. I made it with spice cake mix and adjusted  the seasonings but yellow cake mix is also good.    1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bottom of 9 x 13 pan. 2. Combine  pumpkin, evaporated milk, eggs, sugar, pumpkin pie spice and salt in large  bowl. Pour into pan. Sprinkle dry cake mix evenly over pumpkin mixture; top  with pecans. Drizzle with melted butter. Bake 50 to 55 mins. or until  golden. Cool completely. Serve with whipped topping. Refrigerate leftovers.  Makes 16 to 20 servings.
