"Healthy Bread Recipes & menu planner"  Salton/Maxim Housewares, Inc. (This  book came with my Breadman machine.)    This bread is not quite as sweet as the typical whole wheat bread with  honey. You can definitely taste the yogurt and the maple syrup. It has a  nice flavor and is one of my favorites.
