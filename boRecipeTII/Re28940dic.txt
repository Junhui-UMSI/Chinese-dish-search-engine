Preparation: beat the eggs. Slice the spring onions. Soak the porcini or  cap mushrooms in warm water for 30 mins. Crush the garlic cloves. Slice the  flat mushrooms. Cut the cucumber into matchsticks.    Notes: There is a lot of sauce with this recipe - dont worry! If you cant  find dried porcini or cap mushrooms then use 1/2 pound of shittake  mushrooms (to serve 4) for all the mushrooms in the dish.    1, Rinse the rice under running water and drain.     Place in a heavy-based pan witl 600ml (to serve 4) of water and     bring to the boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the surface     water has been absorbed and there are craters over the top of the     rice. Turn off the heat, cover the pan tightly and leave to stand.    2. Heat a teaspoon of the oil in a wok or frying pan and add the beaten     eggs. Cook on one side to make a thin omelette. Slide on to a plate,     roll up, cut into strips and set aside.    3. Drain the dried mushrooms, reserving the liquid, and chop roughly.     Heat the remaining oil in the wok, add the spring onions, garlic     and mushrooms. Stir fry for 3 minutes, then add the sherry, soy     sauce, sugar and six tablespoons of the mushroom liquor. Bring to     the boil and simmer for two minutes.    4. Transfer rice to a shallow serving dish, spoon over the mushrooms     and their sauce and garnish with omelette, cucumber matchsticks     and spring onion curls.    NB: the eggs can be omitted from this dish, with no problem.
