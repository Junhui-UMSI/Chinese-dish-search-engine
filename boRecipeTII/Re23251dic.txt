Tuna Noodle Casserole
Butter, Cream of mushroom soup, butter, Frozen peas, Ritz crackers, Tuna, Egg noodles, Plain bread, milk, 
Heat the oven to 375F. with the rack in the center position. Grease  or spray non-stick vegetable cooking spray on 1 medium to large  ovenproof baking dish, or two smaller dishes.    Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, but  shorten the cooking time by 2 minutes. Drain the noodles and combine  with the peas, soup and milk. Mash the tuna with a fork to break it  up and add it to the noodles. Mix gently and spoon into prepared pan.  Sprinkle the crumbs over the top and bake for 35 minutes, until hot.    Variations: Add salt (taste first, as soup may be salted enough);  freshly grated black pepper; white pepper; snipped fresh herbs, such  as tarragon, or dried herbs. Also, if youre not an avid fan of bread  crumbs, 2 cups may be too much. Toss 1/2 to 3/4 cups with 1  tablespoon melted butter or margarine for a light sprinkling.
