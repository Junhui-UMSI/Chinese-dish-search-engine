1. Pull off dark green outer leaves of artichokes until you reach the pale  green "heart." Cut 1/2-inch off top and trim stem end down to the pale  green part. Rub artichoke hearts well with lemon and cook in boiling salted  water until tender. Drain and pat dry. Pull out some of the innermost  leaves and spread the hearts open slightly.    2. In a bowl combine crabmeat, cream, capers, green pepper, green onion,  and mustard. In a small skillet over moderate heat, heat butter and oil.  Add shallots and cook until translucent (4 to 5 minutes). Add wine and cook  until mixture is reduced to a glaze. Cool slightly and add to crab mixture.  Season with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.    3. Stuff artichoke hearts with crab mixture. Pack into a tightly sealed  container along with a plastic bag of minced parsley and the lemon wedges.  At serving time, garnish hearts with minced parsley and serve with lemon  wedges.
