Source:CLASSIC KOSHER COOKING by:Sarah FINKEL    Yes there is such a thing as a Pessah bagel. Very easy to make, I start to  serve them even 1 or 2 days before pessah.    In a saucepan , bring to a boil water + salt + oil    Lower heat and add matzo meal all at once, stirring well until the mixture  leaves sides of the pan.    Remove from heat. Add whole eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after  each addition ( I use a hand mixer).    Stir in the peper and sugar .With greased hands, roll into 2 inch balls and  place 2inches appart on a greased baking sheet, For bagels, flatten balls  slightly and make a hole in center.    Bake in a preheated 400 deg. oven for approximately 35-40 minutes until  golden. Let cool.    Yields about 12 rolls or bagels.    Variation: For Pessah soup nuts, pinch off marble sized pieces of mixture.  Place on a greased baking sheet and bake in a preheated 400 deg. oven for       15    minutes.
