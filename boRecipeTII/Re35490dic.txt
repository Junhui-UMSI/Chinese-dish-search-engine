Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Line a 15 x 10-inch jelly roll pan with  aluminum foil, allowing foil to extend beyond ends of pan. Coat foil with  nonstick cooking spray; dust with 1 tablespoon flour and set aside. Combine  3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking  soda and salt in a bowl; stir well. Make a well in the center of the  mixture. Combine water, oil and vanilla; add to dry ingredients, stirring  until blended.  Set aside. Beat egg whites in a large bowl until foamy. Add  1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until  stiff peaks form.  Fold 1/3 of egg white mixture into chocolate mixture.  Carefully fold in remaining egg whites and 1/4 cup flour. Spoon batter into  prepared pan, spreading evenly to the sides of the pan. Bake for 25  minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool  in pan for 30 minutes. Invert pan onto a baking sheet; remove pan, and  carefully peel foil away from cake. Cut cake into 28 hearts, using a 2  1/2-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter; discard remaining cake. Sprinkle  hearts with powdered sugar; set aside. Combine sliced strawberries and  remaining 2 teaspoons sugar in a small bowl; toss well. Spoon about 1  tablespoon Chocolate-Orange Sauce onto a dessert plate; top with a  chocolate cake heart, 2 tablespoons sliced strawberries, and another cake  heart.
