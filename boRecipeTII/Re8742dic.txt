Pound Cake Waffles
Butter, granulated sugar, Eggs, Flour, Salt, Baking Powder, Lemon flavoring, 
Mrs. W. R. Babb  This waffle recipe approximates the proportions of butter, sugar, and flour  used in pound cake, leading to its name.  Beat the butter and sugar to a cream; add the well beaten yolks of the  eggs, then the flour, salt, and baking    powder sifted together. Put in the flavoring and beat the batter  thoroughly. At the last moment fold in lightly    the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Cook as for ordinary  waffles.
