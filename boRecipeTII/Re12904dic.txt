From: "Kathy Klipec Crow" <klipec@ee.Princeton.EDU>    Date: Mon, 16 Aug 93 15:21:24 EDT    I saw a request for low fat oatmeal cookies a little while back.  This  recipe was in a collection of recipes modified for lower fat and  cholesterol levels than in traditional versions found in the March 1993  issue of Good Housekeeping magazine.    1.  Preheat oven to 375F.  In large bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat  brown sugar, honey, corn-oil spread, egg substitute and vanilla extract  until smooth. With mixer at low speed, beat in all-purpose flour,  whole-wheat flour, wheat germ, baking soda, and salt until blended. With  spoon, stir in oats.    2.  Spray 2 large cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray.  Spoon dough  by level 1/3 cup measures onto cookie sheets, about 3 inches apart. With  floured hands, roll dough into balls.    3.  Bake cookies 12 to 15 minutes until golden; remove to wire racks to  cool. Store cookies in tightly covered container. Makes about 14 jumbo-size  cookies. Each cookie: about 250 calories, 5 g fat, 0 mg cholesterol, 245 mg  sodium.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    JUMBO COOKIES!    From rec.food.cooking archives.
