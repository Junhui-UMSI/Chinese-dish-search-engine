1.  Use beef right out of package or season as desired.  Form into 4 thick  patties and place in large nonstick frying pan over med.  Brown meat from  2-4 mins per side (patties will not be fully cooked at this point).    2.  Pour in 1/2 cup of the wine and generously grind pepper over patties.

As soon as you remove burgers, add mushrooms to wine in pan and  increase heat to high.  Stir constantly until they are hot (3-4 mins) and  add remaining 1/4 cup wine if needed.    4.  Spoon mushrooms around patties, then pour sauce over top.    Good with crisp green vegetable and mashed potatoes. Var: try forming  patties around rounded tsp of cheese.
