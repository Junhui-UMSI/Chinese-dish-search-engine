Delicious and dramatic, this dish is a mosaic of colors. Its easy enough  to make for a simple family dinner but impressive enough to serve to  guests. And the best part is, one serving contains 11 grams of fiber,  nearly half the recommended daily intake of 25 grams per day.    IN LARGE HEAVY POT, heat oil over medium heat. Add crushed red pepper  flakes, coriander and cumin and cook, stirring often, until seasonings  darken slightly.    Add peppers, fennel, oregano and chili powder and cook, stirring often,  until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and all  beans and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring  occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add water or tomato juice as needed if too  much liquid evaporates. Stir in cilantro or parsley and season with salt  and pepper.    Serve in shallow bowl, garnished with shredded cheese or yogurt if desired.
