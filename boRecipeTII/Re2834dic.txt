Mix first 6 ingrediants together by hand or with blender until blended. Mix  in Peanut Butter.Line Jelly Roll pan with wax paper(I used foil and it  worked fine) Roll teaspoons of filling into 3/4 inch balls(I used my hands  to do this--it wasnt sticky at all... more creamy. And make the balls on  the small side...they seem to taste better that way). Place on lined  pan...refrigerate for at least 2 hours.    Melt chips and shortening together on stove (I use the microwave for 2  minutes on high).  Use a toothpick to dip into melted mixture). I dump  about 10 balls into chocolate, roll around with a spoon and lift them out  with the toothpick-- Before chocolate sets, decorate with colored sugar,  non-pareils etc.  Refrigerate 10-15 minutes to set chocolate. Remove from  paper or foil. Store in airtight container in refrigerator for up to 2  weeks. Yields: 60 little Balls.
