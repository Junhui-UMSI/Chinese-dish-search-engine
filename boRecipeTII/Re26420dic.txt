Tomato Daal
Garlic/ginger paste, Seasoning:  mustard seeds;, Salt, Water, Garnish: lotsa chopped, Turmeric powder, Fistfuls mung beans, Tomato puree (depending on, 
Pressure cook about two fistfuls of mung beans with water adding 1/4 tsp  turmeric powder to it.  (I usually put one fistful for one person if daal  is not the main dish in the meal. Otherwise , you might want to add two  fistfuls per person. It is probably surprising, but this measuring scheme  works for me)     Once cooked, stir the beans till they can no longer be seen separately.  This step is very important. If the beans are nicely cooked, just a stir of  the spoon will make a smooth paste. This is the reason why we are pressure  cooking the beans. It is not only faster, but also cooks the beans  thoroughly. Cooking in a pan is possible, but be prepared to keep stirring  for about an hour.     Also, if more water is required, add after the daal has been cooked.  For  those who have tried this dish, know what consistency they need.  For  others, daal should be pouring consistency. Add salt.     Add tomato puree (depending on how sour you want the daal) to the pressure  cooked daal.  Add salt, garlic/ginger paste. Let this cook till the raw  taste of the tomatoes is gone. Season and garnish.     Seasoning:  Mustard seeds, cumin seeds and slit green chillies in butter  or oil. (First add mustard seeds. Wait till they burst, add cumin seeds and  green chillies. Do not fry green chillies for too long, as they will lose  their flavor) Add to daal at the very end. Garnishing: Lotsa chopped  coriander leaves.     Note:  To make it fiery, why not add little bit of cayenne pepper powder.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
