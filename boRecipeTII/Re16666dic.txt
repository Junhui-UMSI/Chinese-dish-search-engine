Preheat oven to 450F. Mix together the cornmeal, sugar, baking powder,  baking soda, and salt. Using pastry blender, cut in the shortening until  the consistency is grainy. Beat the eggs into the yogurt, then add to the  cornmeal mixture. Add the cream-style corn and chili peppers, mixing just  until moistened.    Divide the batter evenly among 18 greased or paper-lined muffin cups. Bake  until lightly browned, about 12 to 15 minutes.    NOTES : A nice change from tacos or tortillas to accompany Mexican meals.  Makes 1-1/2 doz. *Carolyns Note: I would just use a can of chopped green  chilies, drained, if fresh ones are not convenient.
