recipes requiring more work - these come from Mable Hoffman?s Crockery  Cookery, ISBN 1-55788-217-7, an absolutely marvelous book    Combine everything except chops, place in pot. Trim fat from chops (I also  de-bone) and top cabbage layer with the chops. Cook low 5 hours.    Posted to Bakery-Shoppe Digest V1 #183 by Mindy <vinqvist@nbnet.nb.ca> on  Aug 06, 1997
