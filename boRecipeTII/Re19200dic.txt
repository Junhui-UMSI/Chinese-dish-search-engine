Combine all the ingredients for the spinach layer and set aside. For the  tomato layer, saute onion and garlic in the butter for 3 minutes. Add  tomatoes and cook for 45 minutes. Let cool. Add eggs, salt and cayenne and  mix completely. Set tomato mixture aside while preparing leeks. Blanch  leeks in salted, boiling water for 3 minutes, covered. Drain and refresh  with cold water. Pat dry. Combine leeks with cream and cook 10 minutes. Let  cool. Add eggs and salt. Layer the 3 mixtures in a greased 1-1/2 quart  terrine beginning with half of spinach mixture, all the tomato mixture, all  the leek mixture and ending with the remaining spinach mixture. Cover the  terrine and set a deep baking pan filled with enough boiling water to reach  1/3 up the sides of the terrine. Bake the p?t? in a 425? oven for 1 hour or  until firm. Cool in terrine for 10 minutes. Unmold and cool completely.  Serve with horseradish sauce.     Horseradish sauce looks lovely served in a hollowed out cucumber section.  This is a time consuming dish but well worth the trouble. May also be  served as a vegetable.    From <Traditions: A Taste of the Good Life>, by the Little Rock (AR) Junior  League.
