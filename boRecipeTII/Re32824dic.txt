Sweet Potato Surprise
Cinnamon, Fresh lemon or lime juice, Green apples or ripe pears, Chopped dried apricots, Chopped nuts, optional, Salt, Butter, Sweet potatoes, Allspice, Minced fresh ginger, Apple juice, Bananas chopped, 
Peel the sweet potatoes and boil until soft. Drain.    Meanwhile, saute apples and bananas in butter with ginger, cinnamon,  allspice, and salt. Cook slowly, covered, but stirring intermittently for  10 to 15 minutes.    Preheat oven to 350#161#F. Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish or deep  casserole.    Puree the potatoes with the fruit juices in a food processor.    Stir the sauteed fruit into the puree. (For a smoother texture you can  puree the fruit first before adding it to the sweet potatoes.) Add the  apricots. Heap into the prepared baking baking pan and, if desired, top  with chopped nuts. (If it looks like the pan is getting too full, butter a  pie pan and bake the extra in there.)    Bake uncovered at 350#161#F for 45 minutes.    This can be assembled a day ahead and stored unbaked and tightly covered in  the refrigerator.    REG shared by Kelly T. McNamara, Cleveland, OH, USA.    Notes:  Pureed sweet potatoes are combined with fresh ginger and sweet  spices, plus several surprises. The effect is delicious but subtle, and  your guests will have trouble identifying all the ingredients.    Serving Ideas:  Serve as part of a Vegetarian Thanksgiving menu.
