Acorn Squash Rings
Butter, Acorn squash, Cranberry relish, 
Slice the squash into one and one half inch rings. Remove seeds and strings  and place on buttered nonstick baking sheet. Top with remaining butter,  season with salt and pepper and bake at 375 degrees for approximately 25  minutes, turning once, so that the squash is cooked through and still  retains its shape.
