How to make Brown Flour:  Spread all-purpose flour in a large, heavy frying pan and heat over medium  heat, stirring, until flour turns a medium brown. May be refrigerated for  several months.    How to make Oatmeal Flour:  Oatmeal flour may be made by pulverizing roled oats in a food processor.  All-purpose flour may be substituted.    Ragout de Pattes:  Place pork hocks in a large heavy pot with onion, bay leaf, savory, thyme  and cloves. Cover with cold water, bring to a boil, skim off any scum from  surface, then reduce heat and simmer very slowly for 2 - 2.5 hours or until  pork hocks are tender. Remove meat from bouillon and set aside. Strain  bouillon and skim off fat. (You may chill bouillon and then remove all  solid fat before continuing recipe.) Using the same large pot, melt butter  and blend in browned flour. Cook on medium heat, stirring, until mixture  bubbles all over, then add strained bouillon. Heat, stirring, until mixture  thickens. Season to taste with salt & pepper. Add pork hocks and cooked  meatballs and simmer gently for about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt  & pepper.    Boulettes:  Combine pork with onion, garlic, cinnamon, cloves, salt, pepper, crumbled  bread and the beaten egg, blending well. Blend in just enough flour to make  mixture firm. Shape into meatballs, about 1 - 1.25 inch in diameter. Grease  a large, heavy fryin pan and brown meatballs well on all sides, continuing  to cook on low heat for about 15 minutes. Makes 12 - 15 meatballs.    From the Petit Poucet Restaurant.  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #017, by jarin@odyssee.net (Jacques Lorrain)  on 	Thu, 16 Jan 1997.
