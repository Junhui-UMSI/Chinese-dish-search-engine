Mrs. W. R. Babb    This is an accurate, though slightly simplified, version of the Turkish  specialty called rahat lokum ("morsels of rest"). A similar recipe, minus  the fruit and nuts, was published by Knox Gelatins Company in one of its  promotional recipe booklets, before 1928, probably in the early 1920s under  the name of "Turkish Delight or Paste."    Soak the gelatine in 3/4 c. of cold water. Bring the sugar and the  remaining 3 c. of water to a boil; add the gelatine and boil 25 minutes.  Add the citrus juice and rind and boil 1 minute longer; pour into an  earthen dish; add nuts and fruit. Cool over night. Make into squares and  roll in powdered sugar.
