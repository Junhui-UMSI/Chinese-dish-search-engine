Rec Franks and Beans
Heinz Vegetarian beans, can, Brown sugar per can, Ketchup per can, Frank, chunked, not sliced,, Prepared mustard per can, 
Mix everything up in a cassarole.  Cover and bake in a 350-375 degree oven  for up to an hour.  The more you make, the longer you have to cook it.  I  have always used kosher franks for obvious reasons, and I think their extra  spiciness is part of the great flavor that develops, ( and you would not  have to "make-do." This is also great for feeding a large number of  teenagers, or for a family cook-out or pot luck type dinner.
