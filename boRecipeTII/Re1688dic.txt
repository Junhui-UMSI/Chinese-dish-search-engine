Add 4 cups  of water, cauliflower pieces and mace. Season with salt and pepper. Cook  slowly, covered, for 25 mins longer, until cauliflower is mushy. While soup  is cooking, make dumplings. Cream rest of butter in a small dish. Stir in  bread crumbs, egg and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. The mixture  should be quite firm. Form into tiny marble-sized balls and leave at room  temperature while soup cooks. When soup is done, drop dumplings into the  soup; leave soup on heat until dumplings rise to the top.
