Taco Salad
Taco Sauce, Scallions, Carrots, Taco Seasoning, Tomato, Fresh Mushrooms, Zucchini, Cheddar Cheese, Ground beef, Fresh Lettuce, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Radish, 
NOTE: Add anything else you might like in a fresh salad.  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------  In a large frying pan brown the ground beef.  Add the taco seasoning or  salsa, whichever you prefer and simmer until most of the liquid is cooked  off.  Cut up and combine all salad ingredients in a large salad bowl. When  the salad is ready,  add the ground beef and mix well.  Taco sauce or  Italian salad dressing both go very well with this one dish meal.  Other  salad dressings may be used as well.
