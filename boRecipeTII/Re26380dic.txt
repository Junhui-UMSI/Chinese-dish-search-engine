Tomato Bredie (Stew)
Sugar, Onions, Bay leaf, Flour, Vegetable oil, Salt, Black Pepper, Ground cinnamon, Tomatoes, Middle neck of lamb, 
Heat the oil in a large casserole dish and fry the onions until soft. Add  the garlic and stir in the meat. Whilst browning the meat, add the  remeining ingredients leaving the tomatoes for last.    Add the tomatoes when the meat has browned and drawn its own liquid. Bring  the bredie to the boil. Cover the casserole and cook the meat on the middle  shelf of a slow oven for 1 1/2 (Or More) until meat is tender. Adjust the  seasoning before serving. Garnish the bredie with bay-leaves.    This is ideal for an iron skillet.  Posted to EAT-L Digest 04 Mar 97 by Pam Knowles <pamk@IAFRICA.COM> on Mar  5, 1997.
