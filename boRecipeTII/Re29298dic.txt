Preheat oven to 450~. Lay  shrimp in lightly oiled baking dish, cut sides down, with tail shells  pointing up. Spread a layer of stuffing over the flattened portion of each  shrimp, mounding it slightly in the center. Bake until the shrimp are pink  and the stuffing is well-browned, about 10 to 12 minutes.
