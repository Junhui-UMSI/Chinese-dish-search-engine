I would have trouble tracing this dish to the colonists, but its a dish  that I enjoy ... and I think they would have enjoyed it as well.      In a frying pan or wok, saute the bacon until it is transparent. Add the  pumpkin slices and onions. Stir around in the rendered bacon fat. Add the  broth. Cover and cook over medium heat until the pumpkin is tender, about  15 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pan.      Reheat the pan and saute the pork until done, about 5 minutes. Add the  vegetables to the pan and toss with the cumin, salt, and pepper. Cover for  just a moment so that the flavors may develop.      This dish should be treated as part of a kind of Chinese menu. Plan  several other vegetable dishes and add a bit of rice. Tom Jefferson would  approve!    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
