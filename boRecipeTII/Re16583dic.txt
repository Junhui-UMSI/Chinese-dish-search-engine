According to NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, men and women behave very  differently in the kitchen. "When men cook, it usually looks like a  disaster area," says the former Minnesota Viking. "And theres no rhyme or  reason to what they make. My father sometimes cooked chicken for breakfast.  And when he cooked, everything came out six times bigger than when Mom  cooked."    Rashads father prepared banana pancakes for him when he was a little boy,  back in Tacoma, Washington. Washad, in turn, makes them for his 5-year-old  daughter, Condola Phylea. On Super Bowl Sunday, he promises, shell be  starting off her day with a short stack.    1. In a mixing bowl, using a hand or electric mixer, beat eggs for 2  minutes until frothy. Add flour, baking powder, milk and oil.  Stir in  bananas.    2. On a hot griddle, pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until edges  become dry, about 2 minues per side. Top with banana slices.  Drizzle with  honey or maple syrup and sprinkle with pecans.  Posted to EAT-L Digest  by Al & Diane Johnson <johnson@NEGIA.NET> on Sep  18, 1997
