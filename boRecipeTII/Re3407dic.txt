Pecan Blue Cheese Crackers
Egg, Pecan halves, All purpose flour, Stick unsalted butter;, Saga blue cheese; softened, 
In a preheated 350 degree oven toast 1/2 cup pecans, about 7 minutes, and  cool. Finely chop toasted pecans and separate egg. In a bowl with a fork  cream butter and Saga until smooth. Add egg yolk, stirring until combined  well. Add flour and chopped pecans and stir until mixture just forms a  dough.    Halve dough and on separate sheets of waxed paper form each half into a 12  by 1 1/4-inch log, using waxed paper as a guide. Freeze logs, wrapped in  waxed paper, just until firm, about 30 minutes.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees and lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.    Cut logs crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices and arrange slices about  1/2-inch apart on baking sheets. Top each cracker with a remaining pecan  half, pressing lightly into dough. Brush tops of crackers, including  pecans, with lightly beaten egg white. Bake crackers in batches, if  necessary, in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets  halfway through baking, until golden brown, about 12 minutes total. With a  spatula transfer crackers to paper towels to blot and transfer to a rack to  cool. Yield: about 90 crackers    Notes: Recipe courtesy of Gourmet Magazine    Recipe by: Cooking live Show #9023    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #967 by "Angele and Jon Freeman"  <jfreeman@comteck.com> on Dec 19, 1997
