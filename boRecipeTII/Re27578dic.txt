red onion, Salt, Black Pepper, Tomatoes with their juice , ***GARNISHES (OPTIONAL)***;, Plain nonfat yogurt, fresh parsley, JALAPENO CREAM, Avocado, Beef broth, fresh jalapenos, fresh cilantro, Water, Black beans, Cumin, 
SOUP:    Drain the beans and put them in a large, heavy pot. Add the broth and  water. Bring the beans to a boil, stirring them a few times, reduce the  heat, and simmer the beans in the uncovered pot for 1 hour.    Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the cumin, and continue simmering  the beans for 2 hours or until the beans are soft (check after 1 and 1 1/2  hours, since the timing depends on the dryness or age of the beans.)    Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and let the mixture cool briefly.  Rinse out the pot. Then puree the mixture in batches in a blender or food  processor until the mixture is smooth, returning the puree to the pot as  you go.    Season the soup with the salt (if desired) and pepper, and bring the soup  to a simmer. If the soup is too thin, simmer it in the uncovered pot,  stirring it often, until the desired consistency is reached.    To prepare jalapeno cream, whisk together the yogurt, jalapenos, parsley,  and, if you are using it, cilantro. Serve a dollop of the jalapeno cream  atop Board: FOOD BB Topic: FOOD SOFTWARE Subject: Z-MM SOUPS    To: ASXV66A James Kilgore Date: 9/5/94 From: ASXV66A James Kilgore Time:  12:05PM ET  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by "M.
