Tomato Bread 3
see directions, 
This is the simplest but one of the most delicious tapas I can think of and  its served in almost every tapas bar. The ingredients are very simple but  depend on the ripest tomatoes and good bread. Surround this with little  plates of roasted red peppers, fried capers, slices of hard boiled egg,  sweet onions, olives, sliced Manchego or cabrales cheese, thinly sliced  serrano ham, etc.    Method: Take thick slices of good peasant style white bread and toast it so  it is just golden but still soft inside. Rub with cut fresh garlic cloves  and then with a dead ripe tomato cut in half. Be careful not to moisten the  bread too much. Serve immediately as is or as a base for other toppings.
