THIS IS A LEFT-OVER RECIPE FOR USE WITH THE AROMATIC CANNELLINI BEANS  MASTER RECIPE.    Remove the steak and beans from the refrigerator to take off a bit of the  chill.    Meanwhile, prepare a pesto by placing the basil, parsley, garlic and  Parmesan in a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until  finely chopped, then scrape down the sides of the bowl. With the motor  running, pour in the olive oil, then the water, in a thin stream.    Mix the beans with half the pesto, season with salt. Set beans and  remaining pesto aside.    Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Grill, turning once,  until just rare in the center, about 12 minutes total. remove from the  grill and lst stand for 5 minutes, then cut across the grain into very thin  slices.    Divide the beans among dinner plates. Top with 2-3 slices of grilled steak  and drizzle with some of the remaining pesto.    This may serve 6 in your family -- it only serves 4 in mine.
