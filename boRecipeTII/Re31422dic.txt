Barbecue Chicken
Crushed red pepper, Salt, True texas barbecue sauce, Thyme, 4-pound chickens; quartered, Vegetable oil, 
Light a grill, preferably charcoal. Rub the chicken with the oil and season  with the thyme, red pepper, salt and black pepper. When the fire is medium  hot, arrange the chicken, skin side down, on the grill. Cover and cook,  rotating from time to time, so the fat is rendered, about 10 minutes. Turn  the chicken, cover and continue cooking until almost cooked through, about  15 minutes longer. Uncover and generously spoon the True Texas Barbecue  Sauce all over the skin. Turn the chicken skin side down and grill, basting  and turning so it doesnt burn, until the pieces are nicely glazed and  slightly charred, about 10 minutes. Serve hot off the grill.
