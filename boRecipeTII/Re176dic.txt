Cut chicken into 1" cubes and marinate for 15 minutes.  Heat 1 tbs of oil in wok on medium heat.   When hot, add peanuts & peppers.   Chow until chilis begin to char (if they turn completely black, throw them out and start over).   Remove from wok and set aside.    Increase heat to high, add another tbs of oil.    Add garlic and ginger and stir once.   Add 1/2 of chicken and chow until no longer pink in center (about 3 minutes).  Remove from wok and set aside.   Add the remaining 1 tbs oil and the remaining chicken and chow until no longer pink.   Return the first batch of chicken to the wok, together with the peanuts and chilis (leave out the chilis if you dont want it too hot).   Add the green onions and cook for about a minute.    Add the cooking sauce and stir until thickened.   Serve over hot rice.   ENJOY!!
