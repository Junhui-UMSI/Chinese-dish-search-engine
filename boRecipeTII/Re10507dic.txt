Quick Golden Stew

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, combine carrots, potatoes, onions and  just enough water to cover. Cook covered until veggies are tender about 10  minutes. Add peas and ham, continue to cook 5 more minutes. Drain water,  stir in soup and cheese and heat through. Yields: 4-6 servings. Sometimes I  use cream of mushroom soup.    busted by sooz    Recipe by: Key Gourmet    Posted to recipelu-digest by James and Susan Kirkland <kirkland@gj.net> on  Mar 07, 1998
