I tried  to fing a similar recipe but they were never the same. Mom said she had  lost the recipe but when I went for a visit recently I found the recipe. It  had been miss filed all these years. I usually add more candied ginger.  Recipe by: Jean Hopkins-Mom    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #872 by Carol & Bob Floyd  <c.floyd@arnprior.com> on Oct 28, 1997
