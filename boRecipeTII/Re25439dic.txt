Remove  and reserve stock. Shred chicken breasts.    Saute chopped onion, celery, garlic, peppers, and tomatoes. Add spices and  masa to vegetables and stir. Add shredded chicken and vegetable mix to  reserved chicken stock. Simmer for 1 hour.    Cut and fry strips or wedges of corn tortillas in oil in skillet. Drain  well.  (or used purchased tortilla chips-baked if you want to save fat.)    To serve soup, garnish with tortilla chips and grated cheese.  (or leave  off cheese to reduce fat.)    This is low calorie and low in fat if you leave out chips and cheese.    I also had tortilla soup at ChiChis and they just used chicken in a broth  with onions, and cubes of zucchini and different colors of squash.  It was  really tasty also.
