Spread frosting between and on sides of  layers, but frost only 1/2 inch around top edge of cake. Decorate chocolate  frosting with reserved 1/3 cup white frosting, thinned with 1 to 2  teaspoons water for easy spreading.    Chocolate Frosting: Combine 2 squares (2 oz) baking chocolate, sugar and  water in sauce pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until  chocolate melts and mixture is smooth and thickened.

Reserve 1/3 cup of this frosting to decorate cake. Add the  cool chocolate mixture to remaining white frosting; beat until smooth.
