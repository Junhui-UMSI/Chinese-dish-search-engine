Vegetable Pizza with Feta Cheese
Dry vermouth, Dried thyme, Red onion, Yellow squash, red bell pepper, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, feta cheese, Lemon Rind, Salt, Black peppercorns, Fresh Lemon Juice, zucchini, Chopped fresh parsley, cremini mushrooms, Italian cheese-flavored, 
In this recipe, the vegetables are cooked in a flavorful citrus-vermouth  mixture. You can, however, skip the procedure and use plain steamed or  sauteted vegetables. A strong extra-virgin olive oil is a must for flavor,  as its drizzled over the pizza at the very end.    Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine first 7 ingredients in a large  saucepan; bring to a boil. Add zucchini, squash, and bell pepper; reduce  heat, and simmer 4 minutes. Add mushrooms; simmer 2 minutes. Drain well;  discard liquid and peppercorns. Place pizza crust on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with half of beta; top with vegetable mixture. Sprinkle with  remaining feta and parsley. Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes or until  thoroughly heated (cheese will not melt). Drizzle with olive oil. Yield: 6  servings (serving size: 1 wedge).
