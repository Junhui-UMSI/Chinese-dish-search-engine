Melt butter in a deep skillet or saute pan over medium heat. Add bacon  and cook gently until bacon is crisp. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon;  reserve fat. Toss bacon with cabbage.    3. Season potatoes with salt and pepper. Toss them with reserved fat.    4. In a deep, 9-inch pie pan, place a layer of potatoes. Sprinkle lightly  with cheese and top with half of the cabbage mixture. Top with another  sprinkle of cheese. Top with another layer of potatoes and repeat the  cabbage and cheese layers, using up all the remaining cabbage mixture and  cheese. End with a layer of potatoes. Cover with aluminum foil.    5. Bake for 45 minutes or until potatoes are thoroughly cooked.
