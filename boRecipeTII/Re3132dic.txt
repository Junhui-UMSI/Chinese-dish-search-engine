Peanut-Butter Corn Muffins
Crunchy peanut butter, Recipe "Corn-bread Batter", 
All right, so you could have thought this one up yourself. Well, I have  already got it in a book, so there! Corn and peanuts belong together, and  this recipe will prove my point.     Mix a batch of corn-bread batter (see recipe). Grease your muffin pans or  spray them with Pam. Put 2 tablespoons of batter in the bottom of each cup  and then add 1 tablespoon of crunchy-style peanut butter. Add the remaining  bit of batter and bake as usual.      When you serve these, ask the younger children how they think you got the  peanut butter into the middle of the muffin. Ill bet you get some  wonderful answers.
