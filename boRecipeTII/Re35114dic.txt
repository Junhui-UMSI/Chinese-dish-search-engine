Recipe by: Beaumont Inn    Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2  hours, skimming the top as needed.    Note: Many regional versions of this soup are thick enough to stand your  spoon in. I developed this recipe to be a lighter first course soup. Its  history dates back to before the civil war and is a favorite at Kentucky  Derby time.
