Aebleskiver (Danish Pancake Balls)
Freshly grated lemon peel, Eggs, All-purpose flour, Sugar, Salt, Butter, Heavy cream, 
An iron pan with circular indentations is used to make the meltingly light  Danish pancake balls called aebleskiver. There is no real substitute for  aebleskiver pans; fortunately they are available in fancy cookware shops or  in Scandinavian import stores throught the country. The authentic way to  turn the aebleskiver in the pan is with a knitting needle.     (I remember my grandmother telling me this too!)  I always thought she was  making it up.     Beat the egg whites until stiff.  With the same beater, beat the egg holks  until frothy.  Combine the flour, sugar and salt and sift into the egg  yolks in three stages, adding the cream alternately. Add the lemon peel,  then stir in the melted butter. Stir a little of the egg whites into the  mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.     Meanwhile, heat an aebleskiver pan.  When the pan is hot, grease each  indentation with butter.  Spoon in the batter, filling the indentations 3/4  full.  Cook until the lower half of each aebleskiver is golden brown but  the upper half is still uncooked.     With a pointed object such as a knitting needle, nut pick or skewer and  using a knife or spoon for balance, tip each aebleskiver and turn it over  in the indentation. The uncooked batter will flow out to fit the  indentation, making the aebleskiver round. Cook until the other half is  golden brown. Serve immediately with butter, confectioners sugar and or  tart jelly. Makes 14 aebleskiver. Taken from Good Bread/Hansen 1976.
