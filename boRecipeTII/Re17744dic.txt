Almond Tea Cookies
Ground cinnamon; to taste, Almond paste, Salt, Butter; room temperature, Unbleached all-purpose flour, Powdered sugar, 
Cream the butter thoroughly in a large bowl, then add the almond paste and  incorporate well. Stir the salt into the flour and add gradually to the  butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.    Chill the dough until firm, at least 3 hours or overnight.    Preheat the oven to 325?. Cut of thin slices of the dough, and, using your  hands, roll out on a floured surface into rolls about the size and  thickness of a pencil.    Bake on an ungreased baking sheet for 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before  removing from the baking sheet, then remove while still warm and carefully  roll in the mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon. (These cookies break  easily, especially if removed from the pan too soon.) Cool on a wire rack  and store in an airtight tin.
