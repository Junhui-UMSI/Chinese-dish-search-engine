Place the  diced stems and onions in a small bowl, and cover with wax paper. With the  microwave on HIGH, cook for 45 seconds. Add the crumbs, cheese, sherry and  enough water to moisten the mixture. Season to taste with parsley flakes,  salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Then spoon the filling into the mushroom  caps.  Place them around the edge of a large round microwave plate.  Cook  on MEDIUM for 3 minutes, turning the plate every minute for even cooking.  Serve hot.
