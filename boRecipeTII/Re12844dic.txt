Ive been asked for a recipe for Zchug (I dont expect english speakers to  be able to pronounce it). Zchug (can be spelled Skhug Skhoog etc.) is  basically a Yemenite sauce or kind of salsa. It comes in two varieties,  green - hotter, and red - milder. It is typically served at Falafel stands.  There are many variations to how to make it, the seasoning mostly. The red  Zchug varies too much, so Ill focus on the green. Green Zchug is  basically made of green chillies (I think the common chille in Israel is  Mirasol, but Im not sure), cillantro (fresh coriander leaves), garlic, oil  and spices.    Puree all the ingredients to produce a paste. Store, covered, in the  refrigerator for up to several months. Yields about 2 cups.
