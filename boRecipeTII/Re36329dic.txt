Beef, Leek, and Mushroom Casserole
Lean beef; cut into dice, Leeks; sliced, Dozen medium sized, Onions; coarsely sliced, Cornflour, Red pepper (capsicum), Garlic, Water, salt and pepper, Beef stock powder, 
Lay out beef on a non-stick tray and grill under a high heat to brown.  Remove from heat and put to one side. Add beef stock and 1/4 C water to a  non stick pan, and "saute" onion and garlic. After a few minutes, add  capsicum and leeks, and continue to cook for about 10mins, stirring to  separate the leeks. Remove from heat. Mix in beef, mushrooms, and about 1 t  salt and 1 t fresh ground black pepper or however much you prefer (after  all youre the one eating it!) Spoon into an overproof casserole dish, and  add additional water to cover. Cook covered at about 180deg C for about 1  1/2 hours. 10mins before serving, thicken with cornflour if needed. Serve  with hot crusty rolls - at least I did and they seemed to go together well.  Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n198 by greg martin  <g.martin@mailbox.uq.edu.au> on Aug 06, 1997
