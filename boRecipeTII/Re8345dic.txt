From: Wayne or Diane Beck <beck@ISLANDNET.COM>    Date: Sun, 30 Jun 1996 22:48:00 PDT  Here is my favorite potato salad recipe, from "The All New Purity Cookbook"  (A Complete Book of Canadian Cooking, Revised, 1967). I got this cookbook  from my mother.    Combine potatoes, celery, onion and parsley in a mixing bowl. Mix remaining  ingredients together. Pour over potatoes and toss lightly with 2 forks  until well blended. Chill at least 1 hour before serving. Yield: 6 servings    Note: I also add chopped hard boiled eggs, sliced radishes and chopped dill  pickles.    P.S. There is a warning that comes along with this recipe. Warning: Keep  potato salad well chilled until serving time. Serious food poisoning can  result if potato salad is allowed to stand in a warm place for any length  of time.
