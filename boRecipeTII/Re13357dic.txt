Yam Timbales with Cranberry Puree
Boiling water, CRANBERRY PUREE, (8 oz) whole cranberry sauce, Heavy cream (I use nondairy), Light brown sugar, Salt, Ground cinnamon, Water, Eggs, Lemon juice, Fresh yams, Egg yolk, 
Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Bake the yams for 30 to 40 minutes or until  tender.  Cool until comfortable to handle; then peel and cut into 1"  pieces. Reduce oven temperature to 350 F.    With the metal blade in place, add yams to a food processor.  Pulse 5  times; then process the yams continuously until smooth, about 1 minute,  stopping once to scrape down the side of the bowl.  Add the eggs, egg yolk,  cream, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon; turn the machine on and off 5  times, scrape down the bowl, and then process for about 5 seconds.    Generously butter six 1/2-cup timbale molds or custard cups (I used metal  molds) and fill them with the yam mixture.  Choose a baking pan large  enough to hold the molds with a little space between them and pour in  boiling water to a depth of 1". Put the timbales in the water, cover  loosely with foil and bake for about 45 minutes or until a knife inserted  in the center comes out clean.    Let stand for 10 minutes while you prepare the Cranberry Puree.  (I prepare  the puree a day or two in advance)  Then run a knife around the edge of  each mold and invert onto a platter. (I serve them on individual saucers --  not everyone likes cranberry) Spoon the Cranberry Puree over the tops.  Makes 6 servings.    Cranberry Puree: Use the metal blade of a processor to process the  cranberry sauce, water and lemon juice until thick and smooth, about 45  seconds.  Transfer to a 1-quart saucepan and stir over moderate heat until  warm.  Makes 1 1/2 cups.
