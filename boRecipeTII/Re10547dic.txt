Quick Macadamia Chicken
Garlic, Sweet red pepper, Macadamia nuts, Honey, Tomato, Chicken breasts, Sesame oil, Dill, Sesame seeds, Green beans, 
Slice or chop all ingredients.  Saute the garlic in the sesame oil, until  just fragrant. Add the dill and the chicken, and saute for about five  minutes. Add the green beans and the red pepper; saute for another couple  of minutes. Add the tomato and the macadamia nuts; saute another minute or  two.  Add the honey and the sesame seeds. Continue cooking just long enough  to warm the honey.    NOTES:    *  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised this  recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and its very quick.    *  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken broth  when cooking the couscous.    *  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about 1/4 t  arrowroot, or some cornstarch.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  20 minutes.  : Precision:  no need to measure.    : Alan M.
