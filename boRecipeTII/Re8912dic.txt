Preparing Fresh Green Chiles
Fresh hot green chiles, 
Select large, firm, smooth-skinned chiles. Rinse & dry chiles. Make a small  hole in each to allow steam to escape. Place chiles on foil covered shallow  pan & set it 4-6 inches below broiler flame. Roast chiles, turning often,  until they are well blistered. Remove from pan, place in a bowl & cover  with a cold, damp towel to steam for 10 minutes. Starting at stem end, peel  the outer skin. Remove stem & seeds. If using for rellenos, leave stem  intact. The chiles are now ready to be used in any recipe or for freezing.  Chiles may be frozen after blistering; skins slip off easily when thawed.    From the <The Bliss of Cooking Returns>, Fort Bliss Officers Wives Club,  Ft. Bliss, TX.
