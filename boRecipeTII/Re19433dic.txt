Vegetarian Chocolate Cake (Courtesy of Kathy Kuehn)
Vanilla, Vinegar, IN A 9X9 BAKING PAN, MIX, Flour, Sugar, Baking soda, Salt, WHEN THAT IS MIXED, ADD, Cold water, Cooking oil, Cocoa, 
Mix this *well*. If you dont, you will get pockets of vinegar (yuck)    Bake @ 350 F for about 30 minutes (or until done)    This is a very quick, no animal product chocolate cake. It keeps well too.    * The Polka Dot Palace BBS 1-201-822-3627.  Posted by THE PRESTIDIGITATOR    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #703 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
