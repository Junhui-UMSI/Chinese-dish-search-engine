In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, saute the onion in the oil over  medium-high heat until golden brown, about 7 to 10 minutes.    Add all the remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat  and simmer uncovered at the lowest possible heat for 4 hours. (This long  cooking removes as much acidity as possible from the tomatoes.)    Puree sauce in 2, 3, or more batches to prevent it from spilling out of  your food processor or blender.
