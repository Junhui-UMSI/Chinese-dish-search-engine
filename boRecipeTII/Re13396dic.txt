For a 15 pound turkey. Spread bread on a cookie sheet and let it dry out  overnight. Place it in a large bowl, pour 1 cup milk over, and toss  lightly. Set aside. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a wide skillet over medium heat.  Add the sausage and cook, stirring often, until the meat is lightly  browned. Remove it with a slotted spoon. Cook and remove the celery the  same way. There should still be a generous film of fat in the pan; if not,  add butter. Raise heat ot medium high, add the mushrooms and cook, sitrring  often, until browned. Add the mushrooms to the bread bowl and pour the  winde into the skillet. Stir it around to loosen all the browned bits, then  pour into the bread bowl. Add seasonings, fruit and nuts and toss madly  until all is combined. Taste, adjust seasons, then stir/toss in the eggs.  Ad more milk only if very dry.    Recipe by: Dressed Birds? Stuffed Birds?
