Season pesto to taste  with salt and pepper. (Pesto can be prepared 2 days ahead. Press plastic  wrap onto surface of pesto and refrigerate.)    Cook potatoes in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about  5 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer potatoes to large bowl.  Add green  beans to same pot and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Using  slotted spoon, transfer to bowl with potatoes. Cook pasta in same pot until  tender but still firm to bite. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking liquid.  Transfer pasta to bowl with potatoes and green beans.    Whisk reserved 1/2 cup cooking liquid into pesto. Add pesto to pasta  mixture and toss thoroughly to coat. Transfer pasta to large platter.  Serve, passing additional Pecorino Romano separately.    NOTES: Basil is one of the favorite ingredients of the Italian region of  Liguria, and there is no place in the world where it is more fragrant or  put to such delicious use. Its the basis of the classic Genoese sauce,  pesto, in which it is partnered with garlic, olive oil, pine nuts, and  Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses. It shows up most typically floating  atop minestrone, drizzled over potato gnocchi, or - as here - tossed with  trenette (the local ribbon pasta), potatoes and green beans.
