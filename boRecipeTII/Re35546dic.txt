Strawbery Banana Scones
Egg -- beaten slightly, Bananas -- mashed, Sugar, Chopped, Flour, all-purpose, Butter -- softened, Baking Powder, Strawberries -- peeled and, Salt, 
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.    Mix together the bananas, strawberries and sugar, set aside. (Dont do this  much in advance, the bananas will blacken)    Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix well with a whisk.  Using a pastry blender, mix in the butter until coarse.  Still using the  pastry blender, mix in the eggs, one at a time.    Stir in the banana mixture.  The dough will be very moist and messy.  Knead  it in the bowl enough to pick up all of the flour mixture.  (It will still  be  very moist.)    Turn out the dough on a floured board, and flour the top of the dough so  that flour coats the entire dough.  Flatten with a rolling pin or your  hands  to 3/4".    Using a knife, cut the dough into squares, or large wedges, and lay onto an  ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake in the center of the oven for 15 - 20  minutes,  or until lightly browned.    I have added pine nuts, raspberries, pecans, anything to the basic flour,  baking powder, salt, butter and eggs mixture.  Yum!
