Posole
Pork shanks, Red chili pods, Pork roast, Oregano, Onions, garlic, Pork rinds (skins), Salt, Posole, 
Place meat and pork rinds and pork shanks in a large kettle and add about 5  quarts of water or enough to cover meat. Add approximately 1 tablespoon  salt and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about 1 1/2 hours.  Remove excess grease and set aside. Reserve liquid. Wash the posole very  carefully until the water is clear so as to remove lime from kernels. Put  in large kettle and cover with water. Boil until posole has popped. Mix  meat, posole, rind and shanks or pigs feet. Add oregano, garlic, onion and  chili pods. Let simmer for about 1/2 hour. Posole may be served as a main  dish with hard rolls, tortillas or crackers. Additional red chili sauce may  be added at serving time for more spice. NOTE:Posole can be found in the  meat section if it is available in your area, if not available, hominy can  be substituted in the same quantities but no rinsing or pre-cooking is  needed. The posole will lose its authenticity but none of its tastiness if  pork rinds, pork shanks or pigs feet are omitted. You can also add one can  of tomatoes to enhance the flavor.
