Strawberries with Orange Champagne Sabayon
Strawberries, fresh, Whipping cream, Sugar, Whipping cream, Liqueur, Grand Marnier, Sugar, Egg yolk, Orange peel, Mint leaf, fresh, Champagne, dry, 
Servings:   4    **other sparkling wine may be substituted for the Champagne.    My notes:  The egg yolk mixture didnt get thick enough (using large eggs),  so next time I plan to increase the amount to 4 yolks.    Whisk sugar, egg yolks and orange peel in a medium metal bowl until pale  yellow and thick, about 3 minutes. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering  water. Add Champagne to yolk mixture and whisk until mixture is doubled in  volume and holds shape on spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over  water. Set over another bowl filled with ice. Cool completely, whisking  occasionally.    Using electric mixer, beat cream with Grand Marnier in small bowl until  almost stiff. Fold cream and Grand Marnier into sabayon. (Can be prepared 8  hours ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)    Preheat broiler. Divide strawberries among 4 shallow broilerproof bowls or  gratin dishes. Spoon sabayon over. Broil until light brown, about 2  minutes. Garnish with mint and serve.    Source:  The WineSellar & Brasserie, San Diego CA- printed in Bon Appetit,  August 1990.    From: Sallie Austin
