Raspberry Chicken Roll-Ups
Fat-free raspberry, Salad greens & shredded, Chopped, cooked chicken, Sesame seeds, to taste, 8" tortillas, 
Combine salad, chicken, vinaigrette and sesame seeds in a medium bowl.  Divide mixture between the tortillas.  Fold the left and right sides of  each tortilla over the chicken mixture, about 2 inches.  Roll tightly away  from you and secure with two toothpicks (one on each side). Cut the rolls  in half, and serve.    Notes: I used a salad in a bag (Doles French Blend) and pre-cooked chicken  (Purdue Short-Cuts, Original flavor).
