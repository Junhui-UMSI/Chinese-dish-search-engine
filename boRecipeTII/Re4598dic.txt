Pfeffernuesse (German Peppernuts)
Nutmeg, Eggs, Grated peel of 1 lemon, almonds, Salt, Pepper, Mace, Cinnamon, Allspice, Brandy, Cloves, Sugar, Candied citron, Baking Powder, Flour, 
Stir together flour, cinnamon, basking powder, nutmeg, allspice, cloves,  salt, pepper and mace; set aside. In a large bowl beat eggs at medium speed  of mixer until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar. Continue beating 15 minutes  longer or until thick and fluffy. Add flour mixture in thirds, adding lemon  peel, citron, and almonds to last third and blending thoroughly after each  addition. Turn half the dough out onto lightly floured surface. Roll out  1/2 inch thick. Cut with 1-inch round cutter (inside of doughnut cutter  works well) and place 1 inch apart on greased cookie sheets.    Reroll scraps. Let stand uncovered at room temperature overnight. When  ready to bake, turn cookies over so moist side is up; put drop of brandy in  center of each. Bake in preheated 300 degree F. oven 20 minutes or until  cookies "pop" and are baked through. (Break one in half; if not sticky,  its done.) Remove to racks to cool. Makes 90 cookies. NOTE cookies improve  with age. Store in tightly covered container. Add a piece of apple to  container a few days before serving to soften them. Per cookie: 48 cal, 1 g  pro, 9 g car, 1 g fat, 11 mg chol.    A drop of brandy on the top before baking causes them to "pop," giving  them a characteristic topknot.   Recipe from: Womans Day/December 18, 1979 copyright 1979 by Rawson, Wade  Publishers, Inc.
