Baked Oatmeal #2
Brown sugar, milk, Baking Powder, Margarine, Salt, Oatmeal, Eggs, 
Mix all ingredients together and pour into 13x9 buttered pan. Bake at 375?  for 25 minutes. I like to add dried fruits and nuts and pour into small  ramekins for baking and serving individually. My guests enjoy this very  much and one stated "its like a large baked oatmeal cookie for breakfast".
