Pumpkin Milk Shake
red & yellow food coloring, nutmeg, Vanilla extract, Vanilla ice cream, milk, Pureed pumpkin, Rum extract, 
This is a fun one for the kids. Its best if you use freshly pur?ed  pumpkin, but canned will do. For each vanilla milk shake mixture of 1/2  pint vanilla ice cream, 1/4 cup milk, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, add  4 tablespoons of pur?ed pumpkin with rum extract to taste and a bit of  nutmeg. To make it pumpkin-colored, just for fun, add 1 drop each of yellow  and red food coloring.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
