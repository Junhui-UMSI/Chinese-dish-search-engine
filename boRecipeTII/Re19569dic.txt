Despite their nauseating title, these roasted peppers are one of my  sisters better efforts!    Roast peppers under broiler, turning once (at about 5 mins) to ensure both  sides become charred. Place broiled peppers in brown paper bag and close  over (Tupperware, et al works fine, too). Let steam, sealed, or about 15-20  mins. Peel, seed and cut the slimy buggers into long, thin slices, then  place in marinade. Marinate 30 mins or so, and serve on a bed of your  favorite salad greens.
