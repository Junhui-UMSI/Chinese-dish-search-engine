*For ancho puree: Ancho chiles, which are dried poblanos, are dark brown  peppers found in the produce section. Remove seeds and stem from one ancho  chile pepper. Place ancho in a small saucepan with water to cover. Bring to  a boil and simmer until ancho is tender. Puree in a food processor.    Melt butter and let cool to warm. Toast pecans and walnuts until lightly  brown. Beat eggs well and then add sugars and flour. Beat until smooth. Add  warm butter and mix well. (It is important for butter to be warm so  chocolate chips will melt some.) Add chile puree. Stir in nuts and  chocolate chips. Pour filling into pastry shell and bake at 325 degrees for  45 to 60 minutes until done.
