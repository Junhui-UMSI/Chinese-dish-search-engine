Pork Sue-Mei (Dumplings)
MSG (optional), Pinch of sugar, Chopped green onion, Medium chopped bamboo, Lean ground pork,, Shu-mei skins, Dry sherry, Sesame oil, Cloves garlic, crushed, Light soy sauce, Freshly grated ginger, Cornstarch, Salt, THE FILLING, Ground white pepper, Egg white, THE WRAPPER, 
Mix all of the ingredients for the filling together, and mix them well.  Place about 3/4 tablespoon of filling in the center of each noodle wrapper  and bring up the corners so that you have a little money bag.   Leave the top open so that you can see some of the meat. For fun you might  put 1 frozen green pea on the top of each for added color.     Steam in an oiled bamboo steamer for 15 minutes, on high heat.     NOTE:  You can also add a bit of shrimp to this dish.   It adds a great deal of flavor.  Try about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh  shrimp.
