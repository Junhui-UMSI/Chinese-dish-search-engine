Two Unique Lasagne Recipes (Vegan)
Lots of grated nutmeg, Soya milk, WHITE SAUCE, (level) cornflour, Strongly flavoured cheese OR, 
For a vegan dish you can make your favorite white sauce.    The Lentil Filling: Boil 4 oz lentils in water until soft (as a rough  guide, cover them and add the same amount of water again).    Fry a chopped onion and some garlic in the oil of your choice. Add a finely  grated carrot and fry that too for a while. Add a can of chopped tomatoes.  Add some (tablespoon or so) of tomato paste. Add some oregano or sweet  mixed herbs. Add the lentils *and* the water they were cooked in. Add a  spoon of yeast extract. Season with salt and pepper.    The TVP Filling: While you are frying the rest of the stuff above put  around 2/3 oz of TVP mince in a bowl with plenty of boiling water and some  concentrated veg stock (vecon or stock cubes or yeast extract). When the  other stuff is ready add the TVP mix instead of the lentils and adjust the  seasonings.    Put it together: Just like any other lasagne. If you use the no pre-cook  pasta make sure that the filling is sloppy so theres plenty of liquid to  cook it. Stick it in the oven at gas 4 (electric 350) (fan 160) for about  half an hour.    The lentil version is particularly nice and freezes well. However it is  very dry if you eat it the next day (or out of the freezer) and you will  need a wet sauce to go with it. I prefer it dry.
