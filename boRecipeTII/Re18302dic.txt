Save any juice that oozes from the cherries (if cherries are used).  Combine the fruit and juice, sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan. Mix  cornstarch and water and add. Cook over low heat 10 minutes, stirring  frequently.  Drain, reserving syrup.     Make the noodle dough and roll it out but do not let it dry. Cut into  3-inch circles.  Place a tablespoon of the fruit on each. Fold over into  half-moons and press edges together with a little water.     Cook in rapidly boiling salted water for 10 minutes or until verenikas  rise to the top.  Drain.  Serve with the syrup and garnish with sour cream.  Makes about 24.
