Poor Knights - Heirloom Recipe From 1500s Britain )
bread, Cinnamon, Confectioners sugar, Eggs, Oil for frying, White wine, Sugar, Cinnamon, 
This dish originated during the middle ages in England and spread all over  the world with many variations. Traditionalists should use bread, but stale  cake is a good substitute. Red wine can be used instead of white.  Substitute milk for wine and you have a more recognizable dish called,  incorrectly, french toast.    Bread: Cut off crusts and cut into quarters. Place in a deep dish. Mix eggs  with wine, cinnamon, and sugar in a bowl. Pour, once mixed, over the bread  and leave to soak for 3 minutes. Heat the oil [1/4 inch deep]. Drain the  bread and slide it into the hot oil {Watch your hands as it spits}. Fry  until golden brown on both sides Drain on absorbent kitchen paper. Sprinkle  with confectioners sugar and ground cinnamon. From Rons Plaice in  Blackpool:) Mar 1996.
