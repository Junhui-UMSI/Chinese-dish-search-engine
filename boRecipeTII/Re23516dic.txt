From: January, 1995 Food Guide column by Jerry Anne DiVecchio This is a  great ingredient. Whole seeds can keep their flavor for years, but once in  liquid, they become soft and easy to chew, while retaining their individual  integrty. Makes a great gift! The proportions dont need to be precise.  Substitute ground seeds if you have to. Store in a cool dark place.    USE to flavor the water to cook vegetables like artichokes. Just dump some  seeds generously into the boiling water. Add to vegetable soup purees --  like carrot. Add to braised meats for roasts and stews, like Succulent Lamb  Shanks (Sunset) see recipe.
