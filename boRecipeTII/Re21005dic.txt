There might be some  additional information here not covered in the recent postings on TVP.    Sprinkle on salads, scrambled tofu, pizza, on baked potatoes, or in soups.  (I just added them to the delicious potato and leek soup posted by Delores  on 4/24/96. Terrific!)    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly Pam-spray baking sheet; set aside.  Stir together first three ingredients. Stir in TVP granules and wait 10  minutes. Spread reconstituted TVP in a single layer on prepared baking  sheet. Bake 30 to 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, until bits are  browned and crispy. Cool TVP bits thoroughly before storing in a covered  container in the refrigerator. Makes about 1/2 cup.    TVP NUTRITIONAL FACTS: Per 1/4 cup dry granules: calories 59, protein 11g,  carbohydrates 7g, fat 2g.  (Note, these are used within other lowfat  recipes, which lowers the total recipe CFF.)    TVP reconstitutes in 10 minutes, ready to add to pasta sauce, burritos,  casseroles, or any dish calling for ground meat. Add 1 cup dried TVP to 7/8  cup (3/4 cup plus 2 T) boiling liquid, usually water or vegetable broth,  which can be flavored with tamari or soy sauce, nutritional yeast or herbs.  Stir to combine, then wait 10 minutes for liquid to absorb. Once  reconstituted, TVP can be refrigerated for several days or frozen, and the  dried TVP will keep in your pantry for months. TVP = textured vegetable  protein.    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #118    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
