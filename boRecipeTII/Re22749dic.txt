Dip a  knife into the flour and chop the apricots finely. Flour the knife often to  keep the cut up fruit from sticking together. Sift the remaining flour,  baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar into a large bowl. Combine the  milk, egg, orange peel, and oil. Stir the flour mixture and the whole wheat  flour. Fold in the cut up apricots, any flour left on the cutting block and  the walnuts. Pour into a well greased, floured bakin unit. Cover and place  on a rack in the slow cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a  toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 4  to 6 hours. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Serve warm or cold.Makes 4 to 6  servings.    Now before you all ask what a baking unit is (I wondered as I sat and typed  this in), I looked it up in the front of the bread section. She says that  some manufacturers are making units for slow cookers, but if you dont have  one, a 2 pound coffee can works. Pyrex muffin cups also work. Also 1, 1-1/2  and 2 quart molds work.    DO NOT LIFT THE LID WHILE BAKING THIS BREAD.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /MISC    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
