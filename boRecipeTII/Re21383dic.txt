University Club Truffles
Unsalted butter, High quality dark chocolate;, Grand Marnier, Coating, Heavy cream, Sugar, 
For the ganache or creamy truffle center, slowly bring cream, sugar and  butter to a boil in a heavy pan. Remove from heat. Add chopped chocolate  and Grand Marnier, stirring slowly until chocolate melts. Refrigerate  several hours until it is hard.    For truffles, pinch off the size you want (about size of walnut) and roll  into balls.  Do this quickly so that the heat of your hands doesnt melt  the ganache.    Roll balls in finely grated dark or milk chocolate, finely chopped nuts,  confectioners sugar, powdered cocoa or a chocolate coating (see note).  Store at room temperature.    Note: Truffle centers can be dipped in quality chocolate that has been  tempered. (Tempered chocolate has been slowly heated and cooled so that the  fat content has become stable enough not to melt at room temperature. This  process is tricky, so Freddi Imel suggests using melted chocolate chips,  coating chocolate or melting pistals available in baking sections or cake  specialty stores).
