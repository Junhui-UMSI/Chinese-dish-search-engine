Liberally grease a 9-inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the  rum and pineapple in a bowl and let sit, covered for at least one hour. In  the bowl of a mixer (or by hand), beat together the butter and sugar. Add  the eggs and continue beating until light and fluffy, scraping down the  sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the bananas and beat in, mixing well.  Beat in the yogurt; do not be alarmed if mixture curdles. In a mixing bowl,  combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice  and salt. Add to the bowl and mix until well blended. Drain the pineapple  and fold in the pecans. Transfer batter to a 9-inch loaf pan and bake for  45 to 55 minutes or until the bread passes the toothpick test. Remove the  pan from the oven and let it sit for 10 minutes, before turning out on a  rack to cool. Per serving: 248 calories, 7.8 grams fat.
