Perfect Pilaf
Butter or margarine, Regular rice, uncooked, Ready-to-serve chicken or, Vermicelli noodles, broken, Mushrooms, sliced, 
In a saucepan, brown mushrooms and vermicelli noodles in butter; stir  often. Add broth and rice. Cover; bring to boil. Reduce heat; cook over low  heat 20 minutes or until rice and pasta are tender. Stir occasionally.  Makes about 3 cups.    NOTES : I dont use the mushrooms.  Tastes just like "Rice-a-Roni", and not  any more difficult.
