1. Beat butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high  speed for 30 seconds. Add sugar and baking soda; beat till combined. Beat  in egg yolk and vanilla. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the  mixer. Stir in any remaining flour with a wooden spoon.    2. To shape, press a small amount of dough firmly and evenly into a  teaspoon (not a measuring teaspoon). Gently tap the side of the spoon onto  a greased cookie sheet to remove the shaped cookie. If necessary, use your  finger to help remove dough from spoon. Reshape dough slightly on cookie  sheet, if necessary. Makes 32 ovals.    3. Bake in 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes or till lightly browned.  Cool on cookie sheet. Combine chocolate and shortening in a small saucepan.  Cook and stir over low heat till chocolate is melted; cool.    4. Place about 1 teaspoon strawberry jam or hazelnut butter on the flat  side of a cookie; top with another cookie, flat side down. Repeat with  remaining cookies. Dip wide end of each cookie sandwich into melted  chocolate. Place on wire rack over waxed paper. Sprinkle with chopped nuts.  Insert a pretzel piece at top of cookie for stem, if desired.    5. To store, place cookies in a single layer in a shallow container;  refrigerate up to a week.    NOTES : For acornlike oval shapes, mold the dough with a flatware teaspoon,  not a measuring teaspoon.
