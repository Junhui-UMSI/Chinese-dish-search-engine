Remove them to a serving platter. Pour meat juices  over meatballs.    3. Take a piece of paper toweling and wipe wok clean of any residue.  Place 3 tablespoons brown sugar and 3 tablespoons cider vinegar in  wok. Cook until the sugar is dissolved. Add tomato, green pepper, and  pineapple chunks to wok. Cook everything 3 minutes. Stir up corn  starch solution thoroughly. Add to wok, stirring everything well.  Cook two or three minutes until corn starch solution is clear instead  of cloudy. Pour over meatballs.
