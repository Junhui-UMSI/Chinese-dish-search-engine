Vlf- Super Bowl Brownies
Cocoa, Baking Powder, Almond extract, Brown sugar, Salt, Vanilla, Honey, Flour, Egg whites at room temp, 
These are extremely low in fat, and the taste is more slightly bitter dark  chocolate than the milk-chocolate sweet of most brownies, however if you  love chocolate, theyre a great treat!    In a large bowl sift flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and packed brown  sugar. In small bowl beat until creamy vanilla, almond extract, egg whites  and honey.    Combine and mix well.  Pour into a 13 x 9 baking pan sprayed with non-stick  spray.  Bake at 375 (350 glass) 15-20 minutes. Poke with a toothpick and if  it comes out with fudgy crumbs, its done.    Do not overbake!  Cool completely before cutting into pieces. You can add  chopped nuts, however it will raise the fat content substantially.
