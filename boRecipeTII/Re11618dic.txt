Raspberry Sauce
Fresh, unsweetened frozen raspberries, Sugar, Cornstarch, Water, Chambord, 
In small heavy saucepan place raspberries and sugar, bringing to a boil  over medium heat.  Mash berries during cooking. Dissolve cornstarch in  water, and add to mixture and stir until thickened(1min.) Strain through  sieve(I never do) to remove seeds. Add Chambord if desired.

NOTE: This sauce is a snap to make, and would also be great over warm plain  ff brownies, or anything chocolate, I think:) I always use frozen  raspberries for this. Let cool and serve either chilled or room temp.  From Fatfree Digest April-May 1994, Formatting by Sue Smith (using MMCONV)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/fatfreex.zip
