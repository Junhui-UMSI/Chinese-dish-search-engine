Sweet Potato Whip
Substitute, Over with a fork), Sweet potatoes (pricked all, Carrots, Nonfat plain yogurt, (optional), Cinnamon or mace to taste, salt and pepper, Defatted chicken broth, (1/4 tsp), 
Bake the sweet potatoes at 375 for 1.25 hrs or until soft. Let them cool to  room temperature.    Cook the carrots in the broth until tender 20 to 25 minutes Reserve 1/2 c  of broth.    Scoop out the inside of the cooled potatoes into a large bowl add the  carrots, 1/2 c of broth, yogurt and cinnamon.    Mash together and then put 1/2 in a food processor then do the other half.  Mix together.    Put in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 before serving.    COMMENTS: The carrots help alleviate the sweetness of the potatoes.    The food processor is not necessary if you have a good potato masher and  the  carrots are tender enough.    This was a great dish to prepare the night before.  Except that before  serving you would need to put it in the oven for 30 minutes instead of 15  minutes.
