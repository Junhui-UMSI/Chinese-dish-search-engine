1. In a large heavy skillet over moderately high heat, warm 3 tablespoons  of the oil. Brown beef in batches, adding more oil as necessary and  transferring meat with a slotted spoon to a large stockpot when well  browned. Do not crowd skillet.    2. Reduce heat to moderately low. Add onion and garlic and saute until  softened (about 10 minutes). Add to stockpot along with broth, beer, the  water, chili powder, tomato, tomato paste, and oregano.    3. In a small skillet over low heat, toast cumin seed until fragrant; do  not allow to burn. Grind in an electric minichopper or with a mortar and  pestle. Add to stockpot.    4. Over high heat bring mixture to a simmer. Add salt, cayenne, and more  chili powder to taste. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, partially  covered, until beef is tender (about 1-1/2 hours). Check occasionally and  add more broth if mixture seems dry. If chili is too thin when meat is  tender, stir in up to 2 tablespoons masa harina. Cook an additional 5  minutes to thicken. Serve chili hot.    NOTES : No Texan worth his or her ten-gallon hat would put beans in chili.  This ones all beef, calling on beer and freshly ground cumin to give it  distinction. Masa harina, the finely ground corn used for corn tortillas,  is often used to thicken soups or chili. It is available in Latin markets  and some supermarkets.
