Puree raspberries and cranberry concentrate in blender. Strain mixture to  remove seeds.  Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in stainless steel bowl  over hot water bath or top half of double boiler until they lighten in  color and become fluffy (about 2-3 minutes). Dissolve gelatin in 4 oz of  juice mixture and add to egg mixture. Continue to beat for 2 minutes.  Remove from heat, add remaining juice, and refrigerate for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, whip cream with 4 tbsp sugar. Beat egg whites until they form  firm peaks. Fold 2/3 of the cream into gelatin mixture (reserving 1/3 of  the whipped cream for garnish) and carefully fold in egg whites. Chill for  4-6 hours. Top with remaining whipped cream and a few fresh raspberries.  Serves 6-8.    Origin: The Ultimate MOUSSE cookbook, Jack Stone and Janet Cassidy.
