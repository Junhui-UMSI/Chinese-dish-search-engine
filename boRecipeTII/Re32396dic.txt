This is one  I make all the time, even my kids will eat it and thats saying something.    Bring water to a boil, add lentils and barley. Cover and simmer for 30  minutes until water is absorbed.  Heat broth in dutch oven, add garlic,  carrot or other veggies and onion and cook until tender. Add tomatoes,  mushrooms and spices and cook for 5 minutes. Mix flour with a little bit of  water and add to the mixture. Stir and cook over low heat until thickened  adding some of the reserved tomato liquid if necessary. Add barley and  lentils and combine well. Top with mashed potatoes and sprinkle with salt &  pepper, cornflake crumbs or whatever you wish and bake at 350 degrees for  30 minutes (45 minutes if made ahead and at room temp.)    This recipe feeds 6 to 10 people, depending on whether you have a salad  with it. You can also divide it among 3 or 4 containers and freeze for  later.
