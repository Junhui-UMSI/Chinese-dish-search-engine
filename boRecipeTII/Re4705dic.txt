Firmly press perforations to seal. Wrap beef  tightly in foil. Place crescent dough and beef in oven. Bake at 375 F. for  10 minutes or until crust is light golden brown.    Arrange warm beef over partially baked crust. Brush with salad dressing.  Sprinkle with cheese. Return to oven; bake an additional 8 to 10 minutes or  until edges of crust are golden brown and cheese is melted.    Meanwhile, heat oil in medium skillet over medium heat until hot.
