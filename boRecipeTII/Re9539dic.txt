Press mixture into bottom of a 9 or  10" spring-form pan. Freeze for 15 minutes (can be prepared up to 3 days  ahead).    Filling: Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350.  Blend all  filling ingredients in food processor until smooth, stopping once to scrape  down sides of work bowl.  Pour filling into crust-lined pan.  Bake until  edges of cake begin to pull away from sides of pan and cake begins to brown  (about 45 minutes); center will *not* be firm.    Topping: Whisk together all ingredients.    Without removing cake from oven, pour topping evenly over hot cake,  starting at the edges. Spread evenly with a spoon or spatula. Continue  baking until edges begin to bubble (about 10 minutes). Cool on rack and  refrigerate at least 12 hours. (Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead). Run a  sharp knife around edge of pan before removing the form. Press hazlenuts  around top edge of cake for garnish. Serves 10 (more or less).    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /DESSERTS    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
