Yakitori - Japanese Broiled Chicken
Dry sherry, Water, Chicken livers, Fresh ginger root, Green onions, chicken breasts, Soy sauce, Sugar, 
Remove any bone from the chicken. Cut into 1 inch cubes. Cut green onions  into 3/4 inch lengths Cut the livers in half (optional)    Alternate the chicken cubes, scallions, and chicken livers on individual  skewers (soaked in water, if bamboo). In a flat shallow glass or ceramic  dish combine the remaining ingredients. Set the skewers in the soy mixture.  Turn to coat all sides and let marinate 20 miutes, turning often or basting  with the marinade. Grill the skewers 4-5 inches from hot coals or preheated  broiler 8 minutes, turning often, until lightly brown and cooked through.  Brush with marinade at least twice during cooking. Dip in toasted sesame  seeds, if you wish.    NOTES : 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger can replace fresh ginger as many recipes  vary with as many cooks, Im sure the substitution of a = little vinegar  for the sherry would be all right. perhaps a small onion cut in crescent  shapes could substitute for the = green onions.
