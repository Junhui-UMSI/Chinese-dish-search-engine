Heres a Kim Chee recipe you might want to try.    This is taken from a local cookbook.    Wash cabbage and cut in 1 inch pieces. Dissolve the rock salt in water.  Soak the cabbage in the brine for 3 to 4 hours. Rinse and drain. Combine  seasonings; add to the cabbage mixture, mixing thoroughly. Pack in 1 quart  bottle. Cover loosely and let stand at room temperature for 1 to 2 days.  Chill before serving.    You can use napa cabbage also. And depending on how spicy you want it can  adjust the pepper accordingly.
