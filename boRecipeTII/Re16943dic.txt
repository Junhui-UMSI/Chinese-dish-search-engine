Bake crust at 350  degrees for 20 to 25 minutes.    Filling: Beat together well and pour over crust while it is still hot. Bake  15 to 20 minutes (350 degrees).  Cool.    Frosting: Whisk together and spread evenly on baked, cooled cookies.  Cut  into bars - makes 24 to 36 bars.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
