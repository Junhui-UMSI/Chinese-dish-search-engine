Black Bean Salsa
(#10) black beans; drained, Salt, Red onions; diced 3/4", Scallions; sliced thinly, Green bell peppers; diced, Fresh tomatoes; chopped, Red bell peppers; diced 3/4", Chili powder; (up to 1/2), Lemon or lime juice, Jalapeno chili peppers;, Fresh cilantro; chopped, 
Mix all together and refrigerate for 24 hours. The salt will begin breaking  everything down and the flavors blend beautifully. Also, the colors are  great. This makes about 2 gallons of salsa. BTW, I sell this stuff for  $4.00 per pound American, and I cant keep enough of it in stock; Im  already planning shortages to keep the fanatics salivating and the prices  high (wicked, mischievous, naughty, hehehehehe...!).
