Bring the milk and the vanilla pod to the boil and simmer for 20 miutes.  Allow to cool. Beat sugar and egg yolks together. Stir the cooled milk into  the egg yolk mixture, and strain into a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Heat  gently, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly. Cool, and mix in  the cream.    If you dont have an ice cream maker, freeze until slushy, and beat with a  fork to break down ice crystals. Repeat 2 or 3 times, then freeze  completely.    For chocolate ice cream, melt 125g dark chocolate in the milk. I use less  sugar when using chocolate. The vanilla version is also nice with fruit  (strawberry, blackberry, whatever) puree, folded through the semi-frozen  mixture just before freezing it completely. Another good addition is this:      75 grams caster sugar, 4 tablespoons water, 50 grams oatmeal    Heat the water and sugar together over a gentle heat until the sugar is  dissolved. Then boil until the syrup turns a golden colour. Add the  oatmeal, and spread the mix on a buttered baking tray. When set, crush in a  processor, or with a mortar and pestle. Again, fold through the ice cream  just before freezing thoroughly.    I usually double this recipe, which then makes enough for 6 people to pig  out on! I use the egg whites to make meringues (made with brown sugar and  topped with hazelnuts, they go really well with the chocolate ice cream) or  cats-tongue biscuits to serve with the ice cream.
