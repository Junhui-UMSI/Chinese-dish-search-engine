Beef Barbecue
Celery, chopped, Chili powder, Onion, Lemon juice, Vinegar, Chuck roast, Brown sugar, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, Water, 
Combine all ingredients and pour over meat.  Cook at 350o until meat is  done.  (I usually cook three hours). Shred with 2 forks or put through meat  grinder. (I return the meat and sauce back to the oven so the sauce is  fully absorbed.)  Can be frozen.    Mary M. Smith Y-GRADALES GREENE COUNTRIE Towne COOKBOOK, 1986 Greenfield,  Ohio pg. 26
