Barbequed Scallops Hoisin
Bay scallops, Red peppers, Dry sherry, Sugar, Soy sauce, Hoisin sauce, 
Alternately thread the red pepper and scallops on wooden skewers, beginning  and ending with peppers.    Mix together the Hoisin, soy, sherry, and sugar. Brush the shellfish and  peppers with the sauce, coating well.    Grill the kebobs over hot coals 4 inches from the heat source, 3 to 4  minutes per side. Remove to a platter and serve.    Scallops and red pepper are skewered and brushed with a Hoisin-inspired  barbecue sauce before being char-grilled for an Oriental flavor sensation.
