Possum or Bandicoot Soup
Water, Small possum or bandicoot*, Fried bread,1 slice per serv, Tin corn*, Salt, Flour or gravox* to thicken, Parsley, Any other vegies desired, Celery leaves, 
Skin and clean possum or bandicoot, then quarter the animal*. Place it in a  large pot or camp oven along with water and salt. Cover and simmer gently  for 3 or 4 hours. (Tough little devils apparently.) Add vegetables and  simmer for another 1 1/2 hours (Still tough. Even the vegies are resisting  being associated with this.) Strain soup through a large holed colander  when meat has left bone and remove bones, especially small ones. Return  soup to the pot and add parsley and celery leaves. Thicken with a little  flour or gravox. Cut fried bread into 1 inch squares and serve soup over  toast,boiling hot.    * For those of you that havent met a bandicoot, it is something between a  possum and a raccoon, sort of, I think, maybe. *Video tape this please. I  have no idea how to do it. Also, for this recipe, "first you have to catch  a possum or bandicoot", but then thats another story. *Tin of corn? Well a  can I guess, 16 oz. *Now, when you boil this meat for 5 1/2 hours, strain  it and throw it away, it does make me wonder what the critter adds to the  recipe. *Gravox is a meat concentrate seasoning I think. The dish must be  need some flavor. *Fry the bread any way you want to. No hints given. It  could be toast, buttered bread that is fried in a pan, or maybe deep fried  in some fashion. *All things considered, a brick or stone would be an  alternative if you dont happen to have a possum or bandicoot available.
