Clean and shuck oysters, leaving meat on a half shell. Shuck the oysters  over a bowl in order to reserve as much of the juice as possible. Set  aside. In a skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Saute the shallots and  garlic until soft and translucent. Add the wine and reduce to a thick  syrup. Add the cream and reserved oyster juice. Reduce until the cream is  slightly thickened. Add the white pepper and salt to taste. Add the dill  and cheese. Blend well and remove from the heat. Arrange the oysters on the  half-shell on a baking sheet. Top with the shredded crab meat. Top with 1  to 2 teaspoons of the cream sauce. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese to  taste. Bake in 375 F oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese has  begun to brown. Sprinkle oysters with minced parsley and serve.
