Remove the skin and membranes from the oranges and slice them in 1/4-inch  slices. Place a layer of orange slices in the bottom of a large glass bowl,  add a layer of coconut, then a layer of papaya, then blackberries, then  starfruit, and then pecans . Repeat the process until all the fruit has  been used. If the oranges are not especially sweet, a light layer of  blueberry or clover honey will help.    Cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate for an hour or more before serving.    Recipe by: Michael Lomonaco    Posted to recipelu-digest by Karen Sonnessa <ksonness@suffolk.lib.ny.us> on  Feb 2, 1998
