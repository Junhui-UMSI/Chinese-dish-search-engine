Rabbit a la Danielle
1/2 pints of whipping cream, Large domestic rabbit, Pepper, Salt, 
Bake in an open casserole at 325F. for two to three hours.  The oval French  glazed earthenware casserole dishes are the best.  A large New Zealand Red  rabbit or one that size is the best.  This will fill a large casserole  dish.  The French remove the eyes, but leave the head attached. Sounds  gross to American tastes, but the head has some of the tenderest meat on  the rabbit and surprisingly a large amount. French children (mine as well)  fight over who gets the head.  Serve with roasted carrots and potatoes.  Danielle says that since she is not a good cook and hates to cook, this  dish is easy to prepare and serve. It still has that marvelous French flair  that is incomparable. Oh yes, serve also with crusty baguettes of French  bread and a very dry Chardonnay.  Come to think of it, a good dry Cabernet  Sauvignon or Pinot Noir wouldnt be bad either.
