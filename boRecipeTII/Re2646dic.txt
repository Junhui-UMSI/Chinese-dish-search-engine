Mix together Amaranth and coconut.  Place on a cookie sheet in the oven  for 15 minutes at 300 F.    While the above is toasting, place the remaining ingredients in a medium  size bowl and mix.    Divide Amaranth and coconut mixture in half.  Mix half of the Amaranth and  coconut mixture in with other ingredients.  After rolling this mixture  into one dozen three inch x half inch logs, coat the outside with the  remaining mixture of coconut and Amaranth.
