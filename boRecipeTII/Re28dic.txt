Jerk Marinated Pork
Salt, Thyme, Allspice, Cinnamon, Cracked black pepper, Jalapeno peppers, Worcestershire Sauce, Green onions, Onion, Garlic, White vinegar, Vegetable oil, Pork tenderloins, Nutmeg, 
I have used Hbs dried and  powdered for the Jerk Spice mixture. If I had access to Datil Peppers I  think that would be the best!      Combine all dry ingredients and mix.   Mix in rest of ingredients either by  hand or in food processor. Place pork in a non-reactive container and cover  with marinade. Let marinate in refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.      On a hot grill, let cook 5 to 6 minutes per side, basting occasionally. To  serve, slice on angle and serve with Jamaican Spiced Vegetables.
