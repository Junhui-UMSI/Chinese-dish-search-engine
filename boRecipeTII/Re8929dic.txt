Preserved Kumquats
Lemon juice, Sugar, Kumquats, 
Wash kumquats.  Pour boiling water over them; let cool.  Will  probably see film of oil on top.  Rinse well and slice crosswise;  remove seeds.    Measure fruit; add equal amount of sugar and just a dab of lemon  juice. Simmer gently on low heat until translucent, stirring  frequently.  Serve with toast.  (If makes enough to store, put in  sterilized jar and seal.)    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
