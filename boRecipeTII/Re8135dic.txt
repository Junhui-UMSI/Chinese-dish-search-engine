From: dz234@cleveland.freenet.edu (Helen B. Greenleaf)    Date: Wed, 11 Jan 1995 17:15:31 GMT  Since I have received several requests for this recipe (which Ive never  made, but have in several old cookbooks), I decided to post it.  According  to the people requesting it, "these are cookies grandmas used to make and  are delicious." Just quoting. Think Ill try them too. This particular  recipe is from the Farm Journal Homemade Cookies cookbook. Yields about 5  doz.    Cream shortening until light; gradually add sugars and continue beating  until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each  addition. Add vanilla and blend thoroughly.    Stir in flour, then fold in potato chips.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2"  apart onto lightly greased baking sheet.  Flatten with floured fork tines.    Bake at 350 for 12 - 15 minutes, or until light golden brown.  Remove to  rack and cool completely.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
