Sift the dry ingredients together. Blend in the lard to form a coarse  mixture. Gradually add the milk until a soft dough is formed. Roll the  dough until it is fairly thin, although it should be thicker than a regular  pie crust. Butter the dough with soft butter, cover with 1/4 inch of brown  sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll the dough up like a jelly roll and  slice into circles about 1/2 inch thick. Pour water into a casserole dish.  Put the sliced dough into the casserole and bake at 375F for about 30  minutes or until the pets de soeur are golden brown. VARIATION: Cranberry  jam may be substituted for the sugar and the cinnamon.
