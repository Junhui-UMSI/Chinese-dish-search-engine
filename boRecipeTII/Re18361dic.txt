Very Best Meatloaf
Onion, milk, Dried thyme, Eggs, Pepper, Soft bread, Salt, Pork sausage, Celery salt, Dry mustard, Ground beef; lean, 
Combine milk, eggs, seasonings and onion in food processor. Blend well.  Pour over 6 slices soft bread. Add ground beef and pork sausage. This make  2 nice large meatloaves. Bake for one hour at 350 degrees. I bake one and  freeze the other. I have one in my freezer now for company I will have for  dinner in a week. Every one loves this meat loaf and I have been making it  of over 20 years. Doris Kennedy  Posted to recipelu-digest by GramWag@aol.com on Feb 7, 1998
