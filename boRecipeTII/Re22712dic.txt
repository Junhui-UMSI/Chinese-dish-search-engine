Apricot Ice Cream
Lemon juice, (5 fl oz) fromage frais, if, Icing sugar, Unsweetened, low fat yogurt, If not, use more yogurt, (5 fl oz) water, (10 fl oz) natural,, Dried apricots, Available, 
Put apricots and water in a saucepan, bring to the boil and simmer for 20  minutes.  Allow to cool, then puree the result in a blender or food  processor, add the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Freeze,  stirring regularly.  An ice-cream maker would be even better, but I dont  have one.
