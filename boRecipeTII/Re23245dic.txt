Tuna Mousse #5
Water, Cream cheese, Onions, Parsley, Crackers, Celery, Plain gelatin, Tuna; drained, Cream of celery soup, Mayonnaise, 
In double boiler, dissolve gelatin in water. Add cream cheese; stir until  melted. Add soup, celery, onion and tuna. Remove from heat; add mayonnaise;  pour into greased mold (or I use Pam spray). Chill several hours or  overnight. Turn out; garnish. Serve with wheat crackers. Note: This makes a  huge amount. I generally make only half.
