Baked Salami with Zippy Sauce
Dijon mustard, Salami; (whatever size you, Regular yellow mustard, SAUCE OF BASTING & DIPPING, Apricot or peach preserves, Honey mustard, 
Score salami, end to end, in several places to allow fat to drain while  cooking. Foil line a shallow baking dish and place salami in it. Cover with  sauce (just mix ingredients no baking) and bake in 350 oven until charred  on all sides (between 45 min. to an hour typically). Continually baste and  turn throughout cooking to ensure even charring.    Once done, cut into bite-size chunks and serve with dipping sauce (I  usually make two servings of sauce - one to baste and one to dip) and  toothpicks.
