If you cant find them dont worry, the recipe will still work OK.    The Javanese seem to like their chicken pretty well done and chewy. I  prefer mine a little more tender and fry it for a bit less than ten  minutes. It has been a while since I made this, but I believe about seven  minutes is enough for me. This chicken is delicious and also good cold.  Make lots of it.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdjaxxx.zip
