Program: 15 minutes first knead       1:10 first rise       20    minutes second knead       30    minutes second rise    At the end of the cycle, the machine punches down the dough, and then, you    take it out, and shape it, put it on a pan, (or in a square pan if you just  cant give up the square shape), whatever you like, and let it rise for  about an hour, or until it doubles in size. Then, make your decorative  insisions, (That will make it look like those beautiful loaves from the  local baker) and bake it at 400 deg. for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust    is a golden brown.    The greatest part is, never again do you have to deal with a collapsed  loaf!! Why? Simply because if your loaf collapses, then reshape it, and let  it rise again. No matter what, youll get decent bread out.    The programmable dough makers definitely are the next generation of bread  machines. Theyll take off simply because theyll satisfy bread purists,  and heck, theyre much cheaper than the full blown bread machines. But in  the meantime, as far as recipes are concerned, its still the pioneering  age for these things.  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe
