Pecan Penuche (Brown Sugar Fudge)
Vanilla, Pecans, Butter, dark-brown sugar, milk, Salt, 
Fanny Farmer    Oil jelly roll or 8x8 inch pan (I always used square pan).  Put sugar,  milk, and salt in 3 qt heavy pan, stir to blend. Put over low heat and  bring to boil, stirring slowly. Cover and let boil 2-3min. Uncover and wash  down sides with pastry brush dipped in cold water. Continue to boil until  syrup reaches firm-ball stage (244F) stirring only if mixture appears to be  burning. Remove from heat, drop in butter without stirring. Set pan on  cooling surface or rack and let cool slightly. Beat until mixture starts to  thicken, add vanilla and pecans, and beat without stopping until mixture  loses gloss. Pour into oiled pan and mark into squares. When firm cut into  pieces and store airtight.    NOTE:  hard-ball stage - drop small amount in cup of cold water.  Forms  firm ball which holds shape. Always test at least twice - you want to make  absolutely sure that it is at the hard-ball stage :-)    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
