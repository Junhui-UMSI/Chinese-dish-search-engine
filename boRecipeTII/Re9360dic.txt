Squeeze out the pulp from the tamarind. You can add a little fresh water  each time to extract the pulp. When you have a about a small bowl full, set  aside.    Warm oil, season with mustard seeds first. When they start to pop throw in  red chillies, chana dal, hing and curry leaves. When dal turns red, add the  green chillies and fry. Throw in the ginger, add tamarind extract  carefully, a pinch turmeric, salt to taste and jaggery. Simmer on low heat  till raw smell disappears and the sauce has reduced to one- third or  thickened yet spoonable.    Crush the roasted sesame seeds with a rolling pin on paper or in a spice  mill rather coarsely. Add this at the end to the pulikacchal. Mix well so  there are no lumps.
