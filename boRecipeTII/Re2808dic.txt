Peanut Butter Cookies Bw
Egg, Vegetable oil, Brown sugar, Vanilla extract, Whole-wheat flour (or less), Baking soda, Peanut butter, 
My note:  tested using 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour.  YUM!  These are large  cookies, 2 tsp sugar per cookie.    Preheat oven to 350 F.    Cream together the peanut butter and vegetable oil in a bowl.  Add brown  sugar, vanilla, and egg.  Beat well.    Add flour (reserve 1/4 - 1/2 cup) and baking soda.  Blend thoroughly. Add  enough extra flour so that you can shape dough into balls and place on an  ungreased baking sheet.  Can be made as 36 medium (my choice) or 48 small  cookies.    Flatten with a fork, bake about 10 - 15 minutes or until lightly browned.    1/24 recipe = 96 calories, 1 starch/bread + 1 fat exchange 2 grams protein,  13 grams carbohydrate, 4 grams fat, 89 mg sodium    adapted from Quick & Easy Diabetic Menus by Betty Wedman, 1993 Shared and  tested by Elizabeth Rodier Feb 94    Recipe by Cathy Luchettis Hot Flash Cookbook  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Wayne T.
