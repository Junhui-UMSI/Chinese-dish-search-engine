From: mariusj@best.com (Marius Johnston)    Date: Sun, 28 Jul 1996 11:46:25 -0700  Did some last night.  This from the All-American Barbecue Book    The secret of this recipe is to cook the chicken at 225 - 250 degrees *skin  side up*.  Check doness by twisting leg, dont pierce the skin.    Salt and pepper chicken a few hours before cooking    I basted every 45 min or so    bbq-digest V2 #054    From the BBQ recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
