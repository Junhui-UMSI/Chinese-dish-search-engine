(I used my fiberware electric grill)    To prepare sauce, in small sucepan, combine ketchup, vinegar, horseradish,  brown sugar, garlic, and thyme.  Mix well.  Bring to a boil over medium-low  heat.  Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Remove  from heat; stir in pepper.    Brush tops of chicken pieces lightly with sauce.  Place chicken, sauce-side  down, on a foil-lined broiler pan or grill rack.  Brush other sides lightly  with sauce.    Broil or grill 3 inches from heat, basting with reminaing sauce and turning  until no longer pink in center, about 5 to 7 minutes per side (mine took a  lot longer, because of the pieces were fatter and farther away from the  heat). Let chicken stand for 5 minutes before serving.    I served this with rice (actually I must admit I used Rice Roni... my kids  love it), tossed green salad, and mixed vegetables.
