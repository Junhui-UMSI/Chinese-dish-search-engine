Pyi-Gyi Nga Kazun Ywet (Squid and Dandelion S
Dried red hot chili flakes, Brown sugar, Clove garlic, chopped fine, Fresh squids, dressed, cut, Fresh Lemon Juice, Soy sauce, Corn OR peanut oil, Dandelion greens, green, 
Watercress and Swiss chard are good substitutes for dandelion since they  all have a slightly bitter but appealing taste.    1.  Mix the chili flakes, lemon juice, soy sauce, and sugar together. Let  stand for 15 minutes.    2.  Heat the oil in a wok or skillet and over moderate heat fry the garlic  for 1 minute.  Add the squid slices and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the  chili/lemon mixture and continue to fry.    3.  Add the dandelion greens and cook for 2 minutes more. Do not overcook  since it toughens the squid.    Serve warm with other dishes.
