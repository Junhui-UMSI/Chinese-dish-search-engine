Note: If using regular green beans, dont tie in knots.    For dressing: Mix garlic, palm or brown sugar, fish sauce, lime juice,  chiles, and lime leaves in a bowl. Roughly chop shrimp and peanuts by hand  or in a food processor and add to garlic mixture. (The dressing can be made  in advance and stored up to 3 days in the refrigerator.)    Blanch beans in a large pot of boiling, salted water until barely tender,  about 1 minute. Immediately refresh in a bowl of iced water. Tie each bean  in a series of knots, 1-inch apart. Then cut between knots, so each piece  has a knot in its center. Combine beans with tomatoes and zucchini in a  large bowl and toss with dressing.
