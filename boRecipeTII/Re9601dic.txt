Combine ginger snaps and sugar in food processor and process until fine.  With machine running, add melted butter and process until crumbly. Pat into  bottom of 9-inch springform pan. Freeze for 20 minutes. In food processor  or by hand, beat cream cheese, pumpkin, eggs, sugar, 1/2 cup Frangelico,  cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla until completely smooth. Pour  into prepared crust and bake at 350F for 45 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk  together the sour cream, sugar and Frangelico for topping. Carefully pour  over top of hot cake, smoothing with a spatula. Bake for 10-15 minutes  longer or until edges begin to bubble. Remove from oven, cool completely  and refrigerate overnight. To serve, run a small knife around the edge of  the cake and then release the spring form. Transfer to serving platter.  Decorate with whipped cream and whole hazelnuts. Leave cake at room  temperature for 45 minutes before serving to improve flavour.
