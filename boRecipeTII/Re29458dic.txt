Bakewell Tart(English)
almond essence, Margarine, Caster sugar, almonds, Shortcrust pastry, FILLING, Raspberry jam, Eggs, 
Set oven to 375/F or Mark 5. Line a shallow pie dish with pastry and  spread with a layer of jam. Mix all the other ingredients together  and spread over the jam. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the fllling is  set. This version of the Bakewell Pudding is often preferred both  for its flavour and texture. The use of ground almonds makes the  filling firmer. Another variation of this recipe uses 2 oz. self-  raising flour and 2 oz. ground rice instead of the ground almonds.
