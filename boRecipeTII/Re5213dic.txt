Pilgrim Pumpkin Cookies
Vanilla extract, Lemon juice, Ginger, Baking Powder, Sugar & cinnamon, Cinnamon, Salt, Crisco, Eggs, well beaten, Nutmeg, Sugar, Canned pumpkin, Flour, Allspice, 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cream shortening and sugar thoroughly. Add  egg, pumpkin, and flavorings, mixing well.  Sift together dry ingredients  and sift into creamed mixture.  Mix well.  Drop by large teaspoonfuls on a  greased baking sheet (or a sheet covered in aluminum foil); these spread  very little.  Sprinkle equal amounts of sugar and cinnamon, mixed together  in a shaker, over cookies.  Bake about 15 minutes.

Theyre chewy and great with a cup of cinnamon  tea, or a cup of hot chocolate with cinnamon sprinkled in it.    * The Polka Dot Palace - The BBS for Homemakers!  1-201-822-3627 * Posted  by LISA on 09-12-95    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #709 by Lisa Clarke <lisa@gaf.com> on Aug 1,  9
