Swamp Water Punch
Optional ginger ale; alcohol, Blue food coloring, Water or orange juice, OPTIONAL FLOATING, Optional: gummy worms, ARMOFDEATH, Orange juice, 
Put some blue food coloring into the orange juice punch until it turns a  disgusting swamp-green color.  The color is gross and the orange juice pulp  floating around really adds to the effect.  People will realize that the  punch tastes good, but it will take them awhile to figure out it is orange  juice.     Floating Arm-of-Death: Freeze the water (and gummy worms if desired) in a  clean rubber glove.  Peel off the rubber glove and float the arm in the  punch.
