Rava Dosa
All-purpose flour, Vegetable oil; for frying, Minced green chili (serrano;, Plain low-fat yogurt, Minced onions, To 2 1/2 water, Minced ginger, Curry leaves; coarsely, Salt, Rice flour, Farina? (cream of wheat), Ghee, 
In a medium bowl combine flours, farina, onion, ginger, green chili, curry  leaves, yogurt, salt, and enough water to make a very thin batter. Cover  and set aside for 1 hour at room temperature to rest.    In a 8 - to 10 - inch nonstick griddle or frying pan heat a small amount of  oil over medium heat until a light sprinkling of water sputters and  crackles on surface of pan.    Before frying each dosa, stir batter well. It should be thinner than crepe  batter, so it will spread easily on the griddle --- add more water if  neccessary (see note). Ladle about 1/3 cup batter onto the hot griddle in a  circular motion, starting from the outside and moving in, to make a thin  pancake.    The pancake will be very thin, and as it cooks small holes will appear  throughout. Sprinkle ghee generously on top. When bottom thurns golden  brown, turn pancake over and fry other side for 30 seconds.    Serve folded in half, golden side out.    Note: Consistency of batter is critical to the success of dosa, so  experiment with varying the amounts of water if neccessary; if dosas come  out thick and gummy, batter needs to be thinned.    To make Masala Dosa: Before removing dosas from pan (with golden side down)  place about 3 tablespoons of Potato Masala on one half, fold over like an  omelette, and slide onto a warm platter. Keep in a warm oven while frying  remaining dosas. Do not stack or cover with a lid, or they will become  soggy.
