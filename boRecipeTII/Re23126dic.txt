(Introduction by Malcolm H?bert)    When the French settled in New Orleans they discovered the pecan. And they  promptly made good use of it by creating pecan brittle, pecan pralines,  pecan sauce and of course pecan pie. The first pecans I ever ate came from  my Grandmothers pecan tree in her backyard. Every Christmas she would send  a 50 pound gunny sack of pecans to my mother. My Grandmothers pecans were  not those tasteless thin shelled kind; hers had thick shells with just as  much shell as meat and 10 times more taste.    This recipe for pecan pie is from my mothers uncle whose family owned  Tujagues restaurant in New Orleans for more than 70 years.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a glass mixing bowl beat the eggs,  blending in the sugar, syrup, butter, vanilla, salt, Armagnac and pecans.  Pour the mixture into the pie shell and bake 10 minutes. Lower the oven to  350 degrees and bake 30 minutes or until a wooden skewer or knife inserted  into the pie comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Serves 6-8.
