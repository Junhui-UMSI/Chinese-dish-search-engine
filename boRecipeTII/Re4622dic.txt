A bit ago someone  asked for a recipe for a phall curry, well here it is, sorry its a bit  belated but better late than never :-)    cut meat into bite sized peices.  Gently fry the onion, ginger and garlic  until golden using half the butter/oil.  Make a masala from the spices with  a little water to make a thick paste, add to the onion mixture and fry for  10 mins or until the oil separates from the ingredients. Add the tomatoe  stuff and the chillies, cook for 15 mins. while the toms and chilies are  cooking fry off the meat in the rest of the butter until browned and  sealed.  Stick the lot into a cassarole dish and cook in an oven @ 400F,  gas mark 6 for 45 mins or the meat is tender.    I reccomend you make an Indian drink with this called Lassi,mix 1pt milk,  1pt  natural yoghurt salt to taste and mix in lots of shaved ice.    I wonder what it would be like using dried habs and hab powder? :-) Ive  got quite a reputation amongst my freinds for eating hot foods but this one  takes the biscuit, youve got to eat it quick in a resturant otherwise they  make you pay for the plate and table as it burns its way thru!
