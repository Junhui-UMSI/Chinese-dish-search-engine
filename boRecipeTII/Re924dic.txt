Hot Savory Sauce for Potatoes (Salsa Picante Para Papas)
Hot red pepper, Dried mirasol chilis, Sprigs of huacatay, Onion, Bitter orange or a lemon, Fresh cheese, Salt, 
Here are the recipes I have. They are from Comidas criollas peruanas  (Peruvian Creole Food Cookbook). These are the translations in the cookbook  (it is in Spanish and English):    Soak the seeded chilis in salted water for 24 hours, changing the water  twice. Chop the onion very fine, wash in hot water and put it to pickle in  the juice of the orange with a little salt for an hour. Cut the pepper in  half, seed, scrape and afterwards grind up with the chili that has been  soaked and strained, the similarly treated huacatay and the fresh cheese.  After mixing everything together well, add the pickled onion, some salt if  required, and serve over potatoes boiled in salted water or in clear soup  (caldo).
