In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Drain     the noodles and add to the stock for about 5 min. Drain well, and cut  into     4 pieces. Remove chicken from the marinade, and broil for 4 to 7 min.     until browned. In a small bowl, stir together sugar, lime juice, 1 T soy     sauce, and 1 T nam pla.     Line a large platter with lettuce leaves. Spread the noodles over the     lettuce, and top with tomato wedges, chopped scallions, and diced     cucumber.     Arrange the chicken, and pour the dressing over. Sprinkle with remaining     corriander and peanuts. Garnish with lime slices.
