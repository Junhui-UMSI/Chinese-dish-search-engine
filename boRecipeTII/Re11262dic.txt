Rajas Con Jitomate (Chile Strips with Tomatoes)
Salt, Tomatoes; peel, seed, chop, Chiles poblanos; roasted, Onions; thinly sliced, Peanut oil, 
Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips about 1  1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too picante, soak them  in salted water for about 30 minutes.    Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until they  are soft.    Add the chile strips, tomatoes and salt to the onions in the pan. Cook  uncovered, over a fairly high flame until the vegetables are well seasoned  and the liquid has evaporated--about 10 minutes.    This is excellent served like a thick sauce over Torta de Elote. It also  makes a very good accompaniment to plain broiled meat, fish, or chicken.
