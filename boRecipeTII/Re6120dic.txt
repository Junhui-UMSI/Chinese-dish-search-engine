Ready-made bread dough is cut into triangles and filled with all the  familiar ingredients. These crescents are not only easy on the budget, but  make for easy eating and entertaining. A great snack too.    TIP: Substitute your favorite pizza toppings (mushrooms, sauteed onions,  anchovies) for the green pepper and sausage. Frozen bread dough also comes  in whole wheat, a good replacement for the white dough.    1) Thaw frozen bread in refrigerator overnigh or at room temperature 2 to 3  hours.    2) On a lightly floured surface, roll out each loaf into a circle, about  10-inches in diameter. (If dough is difficult to roll, pat or stretch dough  with your hands until 1/4-inch thick.) Brush surface with olive oil.    3) With pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut each circle into 8 triangles or  wedges.    4) Generously spread surface with pizza sauce to which oregano and garlic  are added. Leave about 1/4-inch margin on each side. Sprinkle with cheeses,  green pepper and pepperoni.    5) Roll up each triangle beginning from the wide end. Curve ends to form  crescents. Place on lightly oiled baking sheets. Brush tops with egg white.  Sprinkle with additional oregano and/or Parmesan cheese.    6) Bake at 450F for about 15 minutes or until crescents are golden brown.
