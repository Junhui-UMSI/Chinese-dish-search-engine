Vegan- Easy Channa (Chick Pea Curry)
Cloves, Onion, INDIAN curry powder, cinnamon, Cardamom pods, Coriander leaves, garlic, Can chick peas, Canola oil, Tomato ketchup, OPTIONAL, 
Although this is not absolutely authentic, its quick (unlike most Indian  dishes), and easily made for a delicious approximation of the real thing.  Adding the optional ingredients helps the flavor, but a quick-and-dirty  onion-garlic-curry powder-ketchup-chick peas version isnt too bad, either.    Fry the onions in oil at medium-high heat until golden and translucent, 2-3  minutes.  Add garlic, fry for a minute. Add cinnamon, cloves and cardamom,  fry for a minute (until the kitchen begins to smell really good!). Now add  the curry powder to the oni ons, fry for a minute or two. As the mixture  begins to stick, add the ketchup to make it more pliable. Keep on frying  for about 5 minutes, stirring fairly constantly. Once this "base masala" is  ready (one hint is if the oil starts separating from the mixture), just add  the chickpeas, including the water they are in. Stir to mix, heat until it  boils, then cover and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook for 15 minutes,  take off heat and stir in coriander leaves.  Serve hot, with heated pita,  tortillas, Indian bread (roti, naan or puri) or rice.    NOTE:  McCormicks or other American "curry powder" just isnt as good as  the powder you can find in Indian stores. In case you are finicky and an  Indian store isnt easily available, a fair approximation can be made with  1/2 tsp.  corinader, 1/2 tsp.  cumin, 1/2 tsp. turmeric, 1/4-1/2 tsp. hot  chile powder.
