Swordfish Steaks W/oil and Lemon Sauce (Pesce Al Salmoriglio
olive oil, Swordfish, Oregano, Pepper; black, Lemon juice, 
1. Preheat the broiler, or prepare charcoal for grilling. 2. Combine the  lemon juice and oregano in a small mixing bowl. Blend well, then gradually  add the oil while stirring with a whisk. Add a generous amount of black  pepper. This sauce is known as a Salmoriglio sauce. 3. When the broiler or  charcoal grill is quite hot, place the fish steaks under the broiler or on  the grill. The fish should be quite close to the source of heat so that it  will cook quickly. 4. Cook about 1 min. on one side, then turn the fish  steaks carefully but quickly and cook about 1 min. or slightly longer on  the other side. Do not overcook or the fish steaks will become dry. 5.  Transfer the fish steaks to a warmed platter and ladle the sauce over them.    NOTES : Delicious!  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #809 by Roberta Banghart  <bobbi744@sojourn.com> on Sep 26, 1997
