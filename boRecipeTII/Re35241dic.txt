-MIKES KITCHEN-    This recipe is an excellent use for leftover beef. Though there are several  variations possible for a Miroton (mushrooms, tomatoes, garlic), the  predominate flavor is always onions, which are made into a sharp sauce.  Preferably, the leftover beef will be from a pot-au-few that has been  tenderized by long poaching, but roast beef can work as well. It will just  need more baking time. The following is my favorite variation for a  Miroton:        Make sure the beef is chilled for easy slicing. Then, slice as thinly  as possible. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter and lightly  saute the onions. When golden and very soft, about 10 minutes, sprinkle  them with enough flour to make a light roux. Stir the mixture thoroughly  for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the vinegar and mustard. Continue stirring,  adding enough stock or Pot-au-Feu broth to make a thin sauce. Add the  spices. Bring the sauce to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 30  minutes.        Assembly: Pour a layer of sauce into a shallow baking dish. Layer  meat slices, always overlapping, alternating with more of the sauce. You  should end up with a final layer of sauce. Bake, covered, in a 350 degree  oven for half an hour, if meat was originally poached, or for an hour, if  roast beef. Check to make sure sauce does not reduce too much. Add more  stock if necessary.        When preliminary cooking is finished, sprinkle surface of dish with a  thick coating of fresh bread crumbs. Spoon just enough butter over crumbs  to moisten them. Return to oven for about 30 more minutes, or until a  golden crust forms. Sprinkle the top with the parsley to garnish, and  squeeze over it the juice of half a lemon. Serve at once.        Variations: Add tomatoes, garlic, and/or mushrooms. Instead of  vinegar, use a little grated horseradish. In place of some of the stock,  use wine. This dish is very flexible. It is also economical, but it doesnt  taste like it!    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
