NOTE: To poach eggs: In a deep 10- to 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat 2-3  inches of water to boiling. Reduce heat to keep water gently simmering.  Break cold eggs, one at a time into a custard cup or saucer. Slip gently  into water. Cook 3-5 minutes, depending on desired doneness. Lift out eggs  with slotted spoon. Eggs can be kept warm in a shallow baking dish filled  with warm water. From the files of Al Rice, North Pole Alaska. Feb 1994
