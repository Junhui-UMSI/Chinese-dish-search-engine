You can use crook neck, straight neck  or even yellow zucchini, but be sure to select young squach with soft, thin  skins. (why not green zucchini?) This cake, with its accent of chopped  dates, needs only a simple icing to dress it up To add extra moistness and  a sweet citrus flavour, poke all over the warm cake and pour optional glaze  over the cake til it soaks in.    Adapted from a rich recipe with sour cream and pecans created by the late  Bert Greene.
