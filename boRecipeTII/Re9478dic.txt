Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift dry ingredients together and set aside.  In a mixing bowl, cream sugar, oil, and eggs until light and fluffy. Add  pumpkin; blend well.    Add dry ingredients to pumpking mixture, alternating with water, beating  well after ech addition. Pour into 2 (9x5x3) greased/floured loaf pans or  into 8 mini-loaf pans or in 8 clean round vegetable cans.    Bake at 350 degrees for about 1 hour, or until loaves test done. Baking  time will be shorter for mini-loaf pans or round cans. Cool about 10  minutes before removing from pan. Cool completely.    Personal note: I love baking this in cans Ive saved from canned  vegetables. (I know, some of you think this is unsafe....but I do it  anyway.) This gives a nice round loaf, perfect for slicing and slathering  with a nice cream cheese spread.    The home extension agent in my county says its perfectly safe to bake in  the cans...although it didnt used to be many years ago.
