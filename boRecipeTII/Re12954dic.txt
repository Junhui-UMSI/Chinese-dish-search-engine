Zesty Green Split Peas
-Water, Salt, Soy margarine (optional), Jalapenos; seeded & chopped, -Water, Green split peas;uncooked, Bay Leaves, Ground tumeric, Black mustard seeds; ground*, FOR GARNISH, Ginger; peeled & minced, Cilantro, chopped (optional), Canola oil;(I used 2 Tsp), Coconut, shredded sweetened, 
*If black mustard seeds are not available, use 1 Tbs dry mustard.    Mix ground mustard powder in with water and allow to sit for 30 minutes.    Bring split peas and water to a boil.  Lower heat to medium. Add bay leaves  and tumeric (I forgot the tumeric--was good anyway). Simmer, covered, until  peas are done, 40 to 45 minutes. (When pressed between the thumb and the  index finger, they break easily.) While simmering, uncover occasionally and  stir, adding a Tbs or so of hot water if the mixture sticks to the bottom  of the pan.  When cooked, remove and discard bay leaves. Add salt and keep  warm.  Heat oil in a small, 6-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Saute  ginger root and jalape o until ginger is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add mustard paste and cook for another minute, stirring constantly. Add  coconut and stir several times. Remove from heat. Pour over the pea mixture  and stir. (I had to drain my peas, because I still had lots of water in  mine.)  Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Add a dab of soy margarine if  desired and garnish with cilantro. (I didnt use the cilantro)    I think this would make a good filling for pita pockets. I didnt think the  peas were "zesty" enough, so I sprinkled hot pepper vinegar on mine.
