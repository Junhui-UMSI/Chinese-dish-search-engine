* The cooking apple should be peeled and sliced, the pepper should be  seeded and cut into thin strips. In a heavy frypan, heat oil over  medium-high heat. Cook pork chops until browned on both sides and almost  cooked through; remove from pan and set aside. Over medium heat, cook the  onion, garlic, apple and red pepper strips for 2 minutes or until softened.  Blend chicken stock with cornstarch; add to pan along with curry powder,  cumin and cinnamon; cook for 1 or 2 minutes until slightly reduced and  thickened. Return pork chops to frypan; adjust seasoning with salt and  pepper. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes or until heated through. Serve pork chops  with sauce and sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley or coriander. Serve with  quick-cooking couscous flavoured with chopped green onions and raisins.  Serves 4.
