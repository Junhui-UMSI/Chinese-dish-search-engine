This is a recipe that I got in a cooking class  I took at the Disney Institute in Orlando.  It was a healthy cooking class  where we learned and cooked a few things.  This was delicious and very easy  to make! "Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa) is a complete protein. It provides an  essential amino acid balance close to the ideal needed in our diets. Quinoa  contains more high quality protein than any other grain."    Place quinoa in a strainer and run water over the grain to remove the  excess starch. Place in 1 quart sauce pan with the water, and place over  medium high heat until a simmer is reached. Reduce heat and maintain the  simmer.    When liquid is almost completely absorbed, add the garlic and peppers.  Finish cooking until dry.  Finish with the chopped herbs and pinch of salt.
