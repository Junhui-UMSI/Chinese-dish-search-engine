Recipe By: Bill Wight via chile-heads    Heat a large cast iron skillet to hot and toast the tomatoes and tomatillos  without any oil.  Do just one layer at a time and give each  slice a nice  dark brown color on both sides without burning. Remove when toasted to a  glass bowl. Do not deglaze the pan. In a blender, combine the onion,  cilantro, chiles, tomatoes, garlic and tomatillos in batch sizes to  half-fill the blender jar. Pur?e. If any dark brown liquid collects in the  bottom of the toasted tomato and tomatillo bowl, add this to the last  blender load.  Mix the cornstarch in the lime juice/vinegar. In a large  stewing pot, combine the blender loads, add the cornstarch mixture and heat  until  the sauce comes to a low boil, mixing constantly. Be careful here,  if  you dont mix constantly the thick sauce will tend to erupt in hot  little geysers of taco sauce that could burn you. Allow sauce to cool and  add salt to taste.  Transfer to clean jars, filling them 3/4 full and  freeze what you cant use in a few weeks. Be careful not to fill the jars  too full or theyll break when you freeze them. I made a batch of sauce  last year and it tastes just fine after a year in the freezer. The sauce  keeps OK in my refrigerator for at least a month. * Adjust heat level to  your personal taste.  The La Victoria sauce is mild. 3 to 4 quarts Posted  to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #089 Date: Fri, 30 Aug 1996 22:56:42 -0400    From: kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com (The Meades)  CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #089    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
