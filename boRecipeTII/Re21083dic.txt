Two (Or Three) Mushroom Barley Soup
Tamari sauce; if desired, Kinds of mushrooms * see, Precooked barley; or so, Any spice you want. I like, Ribs of celery; (chopped, Some really good veggie, Onion; (chopped up fairly, Carrot; (chopped up fairly, Cloves of garlic; (up to 3), 
NOTE: lots! (I like the ordinary kind we get here in Minnesota, plus  portobello cut thin and nice and my personal favorite, those black Chinese  mushrooms...mmm...yummy flavor. Also, if you have any of these left over,  whip up some mushroom gravy for Sunday comfort food. But maybe that is just  a Minnesota thing :))    This is for Karen, who was requesting barley soup recipes. I fell in love  with this soup for several reasons and I actually brought it for lunch  today. One of the reasons I fell in love with it was because you can do  anything to this soup and it is always amazing. I dont even really have a  recipe anymore; I just throw in whatever I have. There are a few things I  prefer to have in there, though.    Put onion in 1/2 broth and saute. Add garlic after 5 minutes or so. Add the  rest of mushrooms & veggies plus 1/2 cup more broth. Let cook for 10-20  minutes or so and add the barley, more broth and spices as appropriately.    I really vary the amounts I make. There are only two of us, so I make it in  small batches. Also, my SO really likes the barley over everything else, so  my soups are generally barley heavy. I agree with you that it is  terrific.    I hope you dont mind the casual style of the recipe. If this drives you  crazy, I can get the exact amounts in the original from my mom. But dont  worry! You cannot harm this soup!
