Slice the onions and arrange in a 1 quart baking dish.  Mix the rest  of the ingredients and pour over the onions.  Bake at 300 degrees for        1    hour. Yield: 4 - 6 servings    Food Exchange per serving: 1 VEGETABLES EXCHANGES + 1 FAT EXCHANGE  (I would cut down the margarine to make it, if even that, lower then  the 1 fat exchange to 1/2 fat.
