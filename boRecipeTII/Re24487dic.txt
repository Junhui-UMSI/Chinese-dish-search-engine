Trout
Trout; butterflied, Vinegar; (sherry or mild), Salt & pepper; to taste, Maple syrup;  or honey, Sherry; dry(not cooking), Figs; (never used them), Dijon, 
Put 1st three ingredients in a non-reactive pan. Simmer for about 10  minutes. I skipped this step as I didnt use figs. I just simmered and then  wisked in the honey and mustard. Reduce by half. Brush on butterflied trout  and broil. Weve done it on the grill too. Dont cook it to long. I f you  use the figs, take them out after you steep them for about a half hour. Put  them back in AFTER the reduction, enjoy, This is from TIME-LIFE, HEALTHY  HOME COOKING, Fresh Ways With Fish and Shellfish. We first used it on trout  and it is super and easy, and as a bonus, low in calories. WW; 4 Pt; 40 cal  ~-----------
