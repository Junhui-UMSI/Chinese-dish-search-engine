Baked Beans
Tomatoes, Paprika, Sticks celery, Tomato puree, Garlic, Carrots, Onion, Salt and pepper, Brown sugar, Haricot beans, A little stock for frying, 
Soak the beans overnight, or pour boiling water over them an hour before  using. Boil the beans until nearly tender, or cook under pressure for 6  minutes. Peel and chop the vegetables and fry them gently in the stock  until they are giving up their own juices. Cool, remove from the pan and  liquidize this mixture.    Place the beans in a dish and pour over the liquidized vegetables, tomato  puree, paprika and seasnings. If the beans are not just covered by the  liquid, add a little more stock or water from the beans. Cover the dish and  cook at 250F or gas mark 1 for an hour or so, or until the beans are fully  tender.    These are fantastic served with a baked potato.
