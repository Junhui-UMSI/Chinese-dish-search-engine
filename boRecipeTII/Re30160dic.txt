Banana and Ricotta Pizza with Ham
Ricotta cheese, Bananas, peeled and sliced, Milk Pizza Dough, Cooked ham; thinly sliced, Unsalted butter, 
Make the pizza dough.  Preheat the oven to 450F.  If using a baking stone  or tiles, place in the oven now.    Roll out the pizza dough and spread the ricotta over it.  Lay the banana  slices on top in concentric circles.  Brush the butter over the bananas.  Transfer to the oven and bake for 10 minutes.  Remove from the oven and  cover with the ham slices.  Quickly return to the oven, reduce the  temperature to 400F and bake until the crust is golden, about 10 minutes.
