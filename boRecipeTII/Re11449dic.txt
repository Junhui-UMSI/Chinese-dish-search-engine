Raspberry Bavarian Cream
Granulated sugar, milk, Egg yolks, Vanilla, Salt, Water, Raspberries, Unflavored gelatin, Fresh raspberries, Whipping cream, 
In a saucepan, combine milk with 1/3 cup of the sugar; heat until scalding.  In a bowl, beat egg yolks with remaining sugar and salt. Slowly whisk hot  milk into the egg mixture. Return to saucepan and cook over medium-low  heat, whisking constantly, until custard thickens enough to coat a wooden  spoon. Do not let mixture boil or it will curdle.    Sprinkle gelatin over water to soften; stir into hot custard and remove  from heat. Add vanilla and strain sauce through a fine sieve. Cool custard  by setting pan in a larger container filled with ice cubes. Stir  occasionally until sauce starts to thicken and become syrupy.    Whip cream until stiff. Puree raspberries in a food processor or blender  and then strain through a sieve to remove seeds (use spoon to press juice  through sieve and a rubber spatula to help remove it from the other side).  Fold whipped cream into custard, then fold in pureed strained raspberries.    Rinse a 6-cup mould with cold water. Pour in custard mixture and cover with  plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or overnight. To serve,  dip mould briefly in warm water, dry off and place serving plate over top.  Quickly invert and turn out onto serving plate. Trim with fresh berries or  mint leaves.
