Caroles Special Perogies- Jewish Style
All-purpose flour, Sour cream, Salt, FILLING, Potatoes, Margarine, Cheddar Cheese, Salt, Pepper, Onion, 
Using a food processor or by hand, mix sour cream, flour and salt together.  Knead dough until smooth and not sticky. Let rest.    For the filling: Boil potatoes until soft; drain. Mash until smooth. Fry  onion in margarine until softened. Add warm mashed potatoes to  onion/margarine mixture. Season with salt and pepper and add shredded  cheddar cheese or if you prefer, add velveeta or sliced processed cheese.    To shape: Roll dough about 1/4 inch thick on very lightly floured board.  Cut 2 inch circles from the dough. Add a large tablespoon of  potato/cheese/onion mixture onto one half of the circle. Fold over and  crimp edges well so that it is the shape of a "pizza pop." I find it easier  to work with if I turn over the dough circle and put the potato mixture on  the floured side of the dough. Reroll the scraps of dough. It rolls easily  and is easily reshaped.    To cook: Boil about 2 quarts of salted water. Throw in about 12 perogies  and let cook until they rise to the top of the water- only a few minutes.  Drain and continue cooking the rest of the perogies.    Notes: 1. Depending on the size of the potatoes, you can have too much  dough or too much potato mixture or be just right. The dough is easily made  so you can make more up quickly if you need to. 2. Extra dough or potato  mixture can be refrigerated for a couple of days. 3. If you like, you can  freeze the perogies on a lined cookie sheet after boiling. Bag them when  frozen. 4. My favourite way to prepare the perogies after the boiling or  the defrosting is to fry them until golden brown with onions. Serve with  sour cream.
