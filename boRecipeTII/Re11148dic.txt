Raisins, Bread flour, Sugar, Vital gluten -- * see note, Wheat germ, Margarine, Yeast, Salt, Ground cinnamon, Dried apricots, Milk -- at room temperature, 
* Vital gluten can be found at health food stores and at some grocery  stores. It helps to make the bread rise and gives it a tender texture.    Chop the apricots into small pieces, or use dates if you prefer. Place all  ingredients except raisins and apricots (or dates) into your breadmaker  following manufacturers directions. Add the raisins and apricots at  appropriate time; in a Zojirushi and most other breadmakers, there is an  option for raisin bread that will allow the machine to beep when it is time  to add additional ingredients.
