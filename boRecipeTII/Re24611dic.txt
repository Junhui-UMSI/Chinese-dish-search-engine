Snap off tough ends of asparagus.  If asparagus is thick, old or tough,  peel bottoms.  Add asparagus to pan of boiling salted water. Boil gently  until cooked--bright green and tender--but still firm, about 5 to 8  minutes.  Remove; drain on towel; put on platter and drizzle with oil,  lifting spears to coat.   Sprinkle with shallots and parsley.  Salt slightly.
