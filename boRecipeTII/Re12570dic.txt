Yogurt
Canned milk, Commercial yogurt (or 1 pkg., Yogurt starter), Unflavored gelatin, Skim milk, 
Put the milk in a 2 quart pan and sprinkle on gelatin. Let soak 5 minutes  or so then stir with a wire whisk while heating to almost boiling (to  pasteurize).  Cool to warm. Add 1/4 cup commercial yogurt (unflavored) and  whisk in until incorporated.  rinse out small hars with hot water and fill  with warm yogurt mixture  (1/2 pint canning jars work well for this and are  approximately the size of serving size you get in the store). Set in a warm  place overnight, covered with a blanket.    I have read that you can incubate the yogurt by pouring the yogurt mix into  a warmed thermos bottle and letting it sit overnight. Personally, I use the  Salton Yogurt maker that I found at the Salvation Army for $2.00; it works  every time.
