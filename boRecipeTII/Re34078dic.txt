Preheat oven to 225F. Lightly oil a large baking sheet with sides or coat  it with nonstick spray.    Cut fresh tomatoes in half lengthwise. Arrange, cut-side down, in a single  layer on prepared baking sheet.  Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle  with sugar.  Roast for 3 hours, or until very soft and wrinkled.  Let cool  and set aside.    Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, heat remaining 1 tablepoon oil and  dried chiles (or crushed red pepper) over medium-low heat.  Add onions and  garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Add  paprika and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.    Add canned tomatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low  and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let  cool.    Strain soup into a bowl; transfer solids to a food processor or blender.  Puree until smooth, adding a little broth if necessary.  Return puree and  broth to pot.  Whisk to combine.    Using a food mill, puree reserved roasted tomatoes (Alternatively, slip off  skins, puree in a food processor and strain through a coarse sieve.)  Add  puree to soup. (If the soup is too thick, add a little of the reserved  canned tomato liquid.) Season with salt and pepper.    If using shrimp, cook in a large saucpen of boiling salted water until they  just turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes.  Drain and let cool.  Peel shrimp and cut  in half lengthwise.    Ladle into warmed soup bowls and garnish with shrimp, if using, and chives  (or basil). Serve immediately.
