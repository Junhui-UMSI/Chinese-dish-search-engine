Pork sausage, (grated), Chili **, Mild Longhorn Cheddar cheese, Medium-sized mushrooms,, Basic pizza dough *, Green Bell pepper (chopped), Sliced, Ripe black olives, sliced, Onion (very thinly sliced), 
*   Pizza dough is very subjective.  I wont attempt a recipe here,      just make your favorite dough for 1 large pizza.    **  NO BEANS IN THE CHILI!  If you must use canned, I recommend a 15      oz. can of Wolf Brand Chili.  This will work very nicely.    Directions:    1.  Saute the sausage, mushrooms (stems and caps), and Bell pepper      until very lightly browned.    2.  Preheat oven to 500 deg F.    3.  Roll pizza dough into a pizza-like shape, and add toppings in      this order:    :            Chili  :            Sausage, shrooms, and peppers  :            Olives  :            Onions  :            Cheese    4.  Bake for 15-20 minutes.  Use a pizza stone if you have one. If      you dont have one, get one!
