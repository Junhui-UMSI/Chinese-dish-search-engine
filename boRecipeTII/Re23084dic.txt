Add the Grand  Marnier and chocolate; stir until melted. Remove pan from heat and stir in  butter. Place in a shallow glass dish and refrigerate until firm, 2-4 hours  (may be done to this point, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated 3-4  days in advance).  Scoop with #100 scoop and roll into cocoa, nuts or  tempered chocolate. Refrigerate to firm again before serving.    NOTES : Ganache may also be piped into candy cups and refrigerated.
