Heres a Posole recipe that is similar to (but better than) a version we  had in Puerta Vallarta. Our Mexican friend says it is the best he has ever  had.    Chop onions and garlic. Combine all but hominy and simmer for one hour. Add  hominy and liquid from cans.  Heat through and service garnishes, sides and  lots of napkins. ( It is delicious but SLOPPY).
