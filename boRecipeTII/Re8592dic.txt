Wash, peel and quarter potatoes.  Place them in a bowl with cold water to  cover.    In 2-3-quart pot, heat oil over medium heat.  As it heats, drain potatoes  in a colander.  When the oil is hot, add asafetida; after it sizzles in  about 5 seconds, add cumin seeds; when they sizzle and change color in 5 to  10 seconds, add the red peppers, which will begin to change color in just 2  or 3 seconds. Now add the drained potatoes and turmeric. Fry the potatoes  for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.    Add 2 cups water, tomato sauce, and salt.  Bring to a boil. Cover and allow  to simmer very gently for about 1? hours. Serve in a deep dish and permit  diners to ladle individual servings in their own small bowls. Flatbreads  provide an excellent accompaniment to this dish. Leftovers can be mashed in  a blender to reincarnate as a delicious soup.
