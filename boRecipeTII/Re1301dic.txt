Dirt Cake
Oreo cookies, Butter or margarine, cream cheese, Powdered sugar, milk, instant French, Frozen whipped topping, plastic flower pot, 
Plastic flowers    With a food processor or blender, crush the cookies and set aside (you can  also put them in a plastic bag and smash them with a rolling pin). then  cream together the butter or margarine, cream cheese and powdered sugar.  Combine the milk, pudding and whipped topping and stir into the creamed  mixture. Layer crushed cookies and then pudding mixture in the flowerpot,  ending with a thick layer of cookie crumbs on the top. Refrigerate until  serving time, then place the bouquet in the top and bring to the table.  Remove bouquet to serve and scoop out the dessert.    Serves 10 to 12.    Fresh flowers inserted in a florist water vial can be used in place of  plastic flowers.    This is a fun dessert to have on the table throughout a meal without  telling anyone.  There is always a fun reaction at the surprise  "unveiling".    From Doug Smith    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Rfm" <Robert-Miles@usa.net> on Nov 22, 98
