Alphas Peanut Butter Fudge
Butter, Vanilla, Light corn syrup, Evaporated milk, Sugar, Peanut butter, 
In a medium saucepan, dissolve sugar in evaporated milk. Add butter (cut in  pieces) and corn syrup, and, stirring constantly, cook over low heat until  butter is melted. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, to soft ball  stage. Remove from heat and mix in peanut butter. Cool to about 120 degrees  F and mix in vanilla. Spread in suitable size pan (the larger the pan, the  thinner each piece of candy will be; I use a 8x8 pan). Fudge will still be  very soft at this stage; it takes a few hours to set up.
