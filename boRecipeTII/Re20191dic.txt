Work everything up into a  crisp dough. Chill for half an hour (dont refrigerate it - cooling it  suffices...).    Form thumb thick rolls from the dough and cut into 1 cm wide pieces (half  an inch would be okay). Roll them until you get a 4-5 cm (about 2 inches)  long string and form them into a crescent.    Bake them for 10-20 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius (356 degrees  Fahrenheit), but be careful not to brown them too much.    Mix powdered sugar with vanilla sugar and turn the Kipferl around in the  sugar mixture while still hot. Enjoy!    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
