Baked Potatoes with Broccoli and Cheese Sauce
Baked Potatoes, Cheddar Cheese, Black pepper; optional, Hard-cooked eggs; optional, White Sauce; Medium, Paprika; optional, Salt; optional, Head broccoli, 
Prepare baked potatoes. Steam broccoli for about 7 minutes. (If adding  eggs, hard-boil them while the broccoli is steaming.) Prepare white sauce  according to directions and stir in grated cheese when the sauce is  thickened. After cheese melts stir until blended. (If using eggs, peel them  and mash into fine bits with a fork (as if for egg salad), stir until  whites and yellows are evenly mixed.    Cut potatoes in half and fluff a little with a fork, top with equal amounts  of broccoli florets and cheese sauce. Sprinkle egg on top of it all. Add  salt and pepper if desired. A sprinkle of paprika on the top is a colorful  contrast and easy garnish.    Recipe by Mangia!
