Peel and chop garlic.  Seed jalapenos and remove membrane. Slice. Cut green  pepper into thin slices. Beef should be thinly slice across the grain.    Heat wok and add the oil and garlic.  Chow for a very brief moment. Then  add the peppers, chow for a few minutes. Next add meat. Chow again for just  a couple of minutes so that the meat sears to medium rare.
