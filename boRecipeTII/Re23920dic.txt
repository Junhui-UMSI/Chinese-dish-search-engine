If pencil thin asparagus are  available, they dont need to be halved, but thicker asparagus should be  sliced in half, and very thick pieces need to be quartered. You may add 1/4  cup Parmesan cheese when you toss the sauce with pasta, preferably  linguine, then offer extra Parmesan at the table.  Recipe by: Cooks Illustrated, Mar./Apr. 1995,  Page 11.
