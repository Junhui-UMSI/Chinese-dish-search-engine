Perfectly Lumpy Mashed Potatoes
milk, Salt, black pepper, Baking potatoes, unsalted butter, 
In a large heavy pan, cover the potatoes with cold water. Stir in 2  teaspoons of salt, set over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Lower the  heat slightly, partially cover, and cook, stirring once or twice, until the  potatoes are very tender, about 25 minutes.    Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring the milk just to a simmer. Stir in  the butter, 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of freshly ground black  pepper. Cover the saucepan and remove it from the heat. Drain the potatoes  and return them to the pan. Mash the potatoes (leave some lumps). Return  the pan to low heat and whisk in the heated milk mixture. Beat the potatoes  with a wooden spoon (or an electric mixer) until they are light and fluffy.  Adjust the seasoning and serve immediately.    For Mashed sweet potatoes, substitute an equal weight of peeled, chunked  yams.
