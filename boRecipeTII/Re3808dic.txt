Pepper, Water, Salt, Pork Sausage -- bulk, Shortening, Instant Ralston, Flour, 
In a heavy skillet, cook sausage, stirring, until brown; drain off and  discard fat.  Add water, salt and pepper; bring to a boil.  Add cereal  slowly so boiling does not stop.  Boil for 5 minutes, stirring often. Rinse  out a medium-size loaf pan with cold water; pour hot cereal mixture  immediately into wet pan.  Chill until firm.  To cook, unmold, cut into  1/2" slices, and roll in flour.  Cook slices in fat; brown on each side in  1/8" hot shortening in skillet.  Serve with syrup.
