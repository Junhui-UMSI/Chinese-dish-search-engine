Zesty Orange Marinade
Worcestershire Sauce, Vegetable oil, Cloves garlic chopped (2-5), Quartered, Whole orange navel,, Soy sauce, Cumin, 
Mix the first 6 ingredients. Squeeze orange sections into marinade,  then add *peels and all*. Pour over meat,(pierce beef filet lightly  with fork), refrigerate in Ziploc bag up to 12 hours.    Place meat in collander to drain marinade to prevent flare-ups on the  grill. Cook to taste.    Notes: We enjoy this easy to make marinade on chicken, beef or  kabobs. The marinade does the work while the chef gets to go to the  beach.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
