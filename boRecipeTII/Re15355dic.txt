Chop  the sun-dried tomatoes and soak them for 15 to 30 minutes in just enough  bean cooking liquid to soften and release their flavor. Fold the tomatoes  into the beans. Fold in the yogurt. In a large saute pan over high heat,  wilt the greens in the vinegar. Drain well and season with salt, pepper,  hot pepper flakes, and additional vinegar, if desired.
