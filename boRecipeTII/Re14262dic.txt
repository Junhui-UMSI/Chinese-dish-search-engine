White Tassels (Like White Castles)
Ground round, Clear beef broth, Dry onion, baby food strained beef, 
I have some from Gloria Pitzer that I got by sending a business-size SASE  to:    Sample Recipes Box 237 Marysville, MI 48040.    I got 15 recipes along with information on how her cookbooks can be  purchased. (You can only get them direct from her.) Heres one:    Soak 1/4 c dry minced onion in hot water to cover. Let stand till onions  absorb water and are soft. Mix 2 lbs. ground round and jar baby food  strained beef and 2/3 c clear beef broth or boullion. Using 1/4 c mixture  for each patty, shape and flatten to 1/4" thick. Sear in Pam on hot  skillet; make four holes in each patty with knife tip to insure even  cooking. Cut hot dog buns in half and slice off rounded ends. Put 1 tsp.  onions under each patty as you turn to fry other side and slip onions into  buns with patties. Makes lots.
