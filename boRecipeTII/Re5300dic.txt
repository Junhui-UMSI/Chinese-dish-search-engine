Pinched Noodles
Salt, Egg, All-purpose flour, 
Sift flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in center and break egg into  it. Add a little water, enough to make a soft dough. Mix well. Knead to  make smooth. Roll out to 1/8-inch thickness. Pinch off little pieces of  dough with fingers and add to soup. Cook until noodles rise to surface.
