Puree vegetables in a food processor  or press through a food mill. Return puree to the pot and simmer 30 to 40  minutes, until the mixture is reduced by about half. Tie the seasonings  together in a cheesecloth bag and add to the tomatoe mixture. Simmer,  stirring frequently to prevent sticking and scorching, until the catsup is  very thick. Remove spice bag. Spoon into clean, hot jars, leaving 1/2 inch  headspace; seal. Process in a boiling water bath 10 minutes. Yield about 7  pints.    EAT-L DIGEST 12 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
