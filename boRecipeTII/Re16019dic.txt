Vanilla extract, Unsalted Butter; **Note, Cut, Rum Extract; *Note, Bananas; Peel, Cut On, Sugar, 
*NOTE:  Original recipe used 2 T brandy - I omitted    **NOTE:  Original recipe used 2 T butter    A simple recipe, this is easily varied by using another alcohol, usch as  rum, in place of the brandy; by adding a T of cream and/or grated chcolate,  or the greated zest of a lemon, orange, or lime.  Serve the bananas on  their own, with cookies or over ice cream.    Cut a 12 x 14" piece of aluminum foil and put the banans in the center of  the foil.  Sprinkle with the sugar, drizzle the brandy and vanilla over,  and dot withthe butter. Brind two opposite sides of the foil up over the  bananas and fold the edges together three times in 1/4" folds to seal. Fold  together the remaining sides in the same way.  Place the foil package in  the steaming basket and steam until just warmed through, about 10 minutes.    To serve, slit the foil open wiht a knife and slide the bananas onto  individual plates.  Drizzle the juices over and serve.    If you make this please remember my email address, write to me and give me  enough to come to your house for dessert...this is really wonderful.  It  has a creamy texture and tastes heavenly.
