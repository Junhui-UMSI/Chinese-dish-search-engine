Aztec Punch
Grapefruit juice, Sugar, Lemon juice, Dark tea, Tequila, Cinnamon, 
When making strong tea for punch, it is better to use more tea bags than to  let the tea steep longer. When tea steeps for a long time, it acquires a  tannic acidity that may conflict with the other ingredients. Mix all the  ingredients together. Serve over ice.
