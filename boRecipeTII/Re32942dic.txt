Place all the dough ingredients in the ABM and press start. When the timer  reaches 2:40 take the dough out of the pan, Make sure you DO NOT remove the  pan as the timer will recycle. Remove the dough to a lightly floured board.  Remove the kneading blade from the pan. (be careful as at 2:30 it will  start up to take the gas out of the dough). Use a pair of scissors or a  sharp knife to divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. (cut the dough into 3  equal pieces and then cut them into 4s) Form each into a ball and then  with the palm of your hand flatten into circle. Place 1 Tbs of the apple  filling intothe center of each ball and bring the edges of hte dough up and  around to enclose the filling. Dip each ball into the oil, then into the  poppy seeds. Place the balls back into the ABM in two layers. The  directions are for the Hitachi ABM but should work on other models.    Posted to recipelu-digest by Kara9718 <Kara9718@aol.com> on Mar 28, 1998
