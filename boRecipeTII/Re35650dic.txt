Stuffed Artichokes
Garlic, whole artichokes, olive oil, Italian seasoned crumbs, Italian cheese, 
Sut off stems of artichokes and across 1" of top leaves. Remove prickly  tip of other leaves by clipping off top. Rinse thoroughly in cold water,  drain.  Press top, cut side down, firmly to force leaves to open slightly.  Pull leaves gently to open far enough to stuff. Combine bread crumbs,  garlic and grated cheese, mix thoroughly. Set artichoke, bottom down, and  pour stuffing into cavities formed by leaves. Stuff as manyh leaves as  possible.  Put abt. 1/2 of salted water and 1/4 cup olive oil in pot, bring  to gentle boil.  Place chokes in pan, bottom down, and cover pot tightly.  Cook abt. 20 minutes. The chokes will steam and stuffing will be moistened.  Remove cover and dribble olive oil onto stuffing until thoroughly  moistened.  Re-cover and continue to cook 20 min. longer or until bottom  leaves pull away easily.
