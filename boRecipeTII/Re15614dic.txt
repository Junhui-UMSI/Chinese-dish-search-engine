A Berry, Berry Good Cobbler
Salt, Baking Powder, milk, Sugar, Flour, Egg, Butter, 
Mix together above ingredients. Pour six cups fruit, fresh or frozen, in a  9x9-inch baking pan. Sweeten the fruit to taste with sugar. Pour mixture  over fruit. Sprinkle lightly with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. Bake at  350 degrees 45-50 minutes, or until the topping is cooked through. I have  used frozen blueberries, blackberries, and mixed fruits. Thinly sliced  apples would be good. Tonights flavor will be peaches from our tree. My  favorite? Apricots, of course. Enjoy.    Posted to KitMailbox Digest  by ChefAlice@aol.com on Sep 12, 1997
