Apple Cheddar Pie
Sugar, All-purpose flour, Salt, Margarine or butter; plus..., Ice water, Cheddar cheese, Peeled, sliced apples, Margarine or butter, Vegetable shortening, Enriched Corn Meal, Cinnamon, (about 8 medium apples), (Aunt Jemima or Quaker), 
Combine 2 cups flour, corn meal and salt.  Cut in 1/3 cup margarine and  shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese. Add  water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring lightly until mixture forms a ball.  Divide dough into 2 parts, 1 slightly larger; shape each to form ball. Wrap  securely in plastic wrap or wax paper; chill about 30 minutes. Roll large  ball on lightly floured surface to form 11-inch circle. Fit loosely into  9-inch pie plate; trim. Roll remaining dough to form 12-inch square. Cut  into 12 x 3/4-inch strips.*    Heat oven to 400 F.  Combine remaining 1/3 cup flour, apples, sugar and  cinnamon; spoon into crust.  Dot with remaining 2 tablespoons margarine.  Weave strips atop filling to make a lattice crust. Trim even with outer rim  of pie plate.  Fold lower crust over strips; seal and flute. Bake 30 to 35  minutes or until crust is light golden brown, shielding edges with aluminum  foil if necessary.  Cool slightly.    *NOTE: To make a double crust pie, roll remaining dough to form 10-inch  circle instead of cutting strips. Prepare filling as directed. Place top  crust over filling; trim. Turn edges under; flute. Cut slits in top crust  to allow steam to escape.
