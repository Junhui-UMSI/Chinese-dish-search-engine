Tories Favorite Pizza
Active dry yeast, Parmesan cheese, Oregano, olive oil, Salt, Bread flour, Water, 
Add all to ABM in the proper order for your machine. Program ABM for dough  cycle.    At the end of the cycle remove dough and stretch it to fit pizza pan. I  hold it up and pull the sides til I get a round shape...keep pulling till  pan size. Lightly oil pan and place dough on it. Prick all over with a fork  and pop it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes till very  lightly browned. I then top pizza with Ragu Hearty Parmesan and Romano  flavored sauce, shreaded mozzarella cheese, and sprinkle parmesen lightly  all over top. I added sliced thin pepperonni tonight too. Put it back in  the oven for about 10 more minutes. The family went wild!    Posted to Digest bread-bakers.v098.n004 by SmokeyKat4 <SmokeyKat4@aol.com>  on Jan 12, 1998
