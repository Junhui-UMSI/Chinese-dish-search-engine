**NOTE - Obviously the recipe recommends using Near East Pilaf mix, but any  packaged mix will do. We use the Mahatma Saffron Rice mix, which is a  little less than 6.25 oz, but it still turns out great. Toss chicken with  paprika, cinnamon and cardamom. In large nonstick skillet, heat 2 Tbsp  olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken, cook 5 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Remove from skillet, set aside. In same skillet, heat  remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add onion; cook 8 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Stir in rice pilaf mix, contents of Spice Sack,  broth, apricots, and orange zest; bring to a boil. Cover; reduce heat to  low. Simmer 15 minutes. Stir in reserved chicken and almonds. Cover;  continue to simmer 5 to 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.    Recipe By     : INFOSPRTJS    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
