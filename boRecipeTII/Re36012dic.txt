Beef Meatballs
Dry sherry, ginger, ****  NO   E  *****, Chinese rice wine, Spinach, Cornstarch, Sesame oil, Lean ground beef, Egg, Msg, Sugar, Green Onions, orange peel, Soybean condiment, Garlic, Dark soy sauce, 
* Note:  Soybean condiment (mein see) can be found       in Asian and  Oriental markets.                                Mix all ingredients  together with the exception of the garnish. You need to whip this dish to  make it smooth, so I suggest a good electric mixer. Otherwise, do it by  hand and beat the blazes out of this stuff.          Roll into small  meatballs about 1 1/4-inches in diameter. Press some of the greens into a  steaming         bowl and top with the meatballs. Steam the meatballs in  several dishes, steaming         each, or all together, for that matter,  for about 15       minutes. It is best to use your bamboo steaming racks  for these dishes. This recipe makes about 20 dim sum. Hint: To keep  meatballs from sticking to your          hands, simply moisten your hands  in between each           molding of a meatball. Comments: This is a  quicky. Buy good hamburger and do something special in almost no time at  all.  I love     these meatballs.
