Remove to  flameproof casserole which has a lid, and season with salt and pepper. Save  fat in pan.  Add stock; cover and simmer gently until tender, about 45  minutes.  Meanwhile, combine prepared chiles, onion, garlic, spices, nuts,  bread and a little stock in the blender and blend to a coarse puree,  blending in 2 batches.    Heat oil and butter remaining in skillet, adding enough to make 2 Tbsp. if  necessary.  Cook the puree for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  Pour the  stock off the chicken; add to the sauce; and cook, over low heat, until it  is the consistency of heavy cream. Pour over the chicken in the casserole,  and simmer gently for 5 minutes or until heated through. Serves 6.    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V2 #267    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
