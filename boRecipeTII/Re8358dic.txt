From: aiko@mil.emc.com (Aiko Pinkoski)    Date: Tue, 23 Jul 1996 11:01:26 -0400  This is not really a recipe, since I didnt even measure, but it came out  very good, and several SAD eaters liked it so here is a tested "suggestion"  for potato salad:    The veggies were simple: chopped onion, diced red and green pepper, diced  dill pickles, barely cooked corn, and diced boiled red potatoes. I splashed  some raspberry thyme vinegar on the potatoes while still warm. Then added    fresh lavender (snip leaves and also some flower buds, very decorative on  top).. this is really different!    snipped fresh mint    then made a dressing out of: more raspberry thyme vinegar, grainy mustard,  a little fatfree sour cream, and fresh ground black pepper.    Tossed everything together.    fatfree digest V96 #203    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
