Pita Breads
Salt, Wrist-temperature water, Sugar or honey, Flour; see note, 1/2 tsp active dry yeast;, 
Note: 1 cu can be whole wheat This makes twelve small or 6 large pitas.  Sprinkle yeast into water and wait til foamy. Add sugar or honey and salt  and stir to dissolve. Beat in 1 cu flour for a smooth batter. Add rest of  flour gradually for a fairly soft dough. Knead til smooth. Cover with damp  towel; let rise til double. Punch down and knead a few minutes. Divide in 6  or 12 pieces. Knead each unit and roll into 1/8 - 1/4 inch thick circleoids  (my word  :). The shape and size dont matter so much as thickness. I found its  better to err on the side of too thick, as too thin makes them burn easily  and be cracker-like. Use lots of flour when rolling. Let circleoids rest at  least 30 minutes covered with damp towel. (I rest them on placemats.) Heat  oven to 500F and heat baking sheets. I use just one sheet and bake pitas  two at a time. Brush hot sheets with oil or sprinkle with cornmeal. (I have  used sesame seeds sucessfully.) Place (slide) pitas on hot sheets and bake  just 5 to 8 minutes until puffed like blowfish and perhaps very slightly  brown. W! atch closely; they bake fast. Wrap pitas in damp towel and put in  paper or plastic grocery bag for 15 minutes. This important step keeps them  supple. These are easy to make, very good, and fat-free. They freeze well  and thaw fairly quickly.  Recipe By     : GwynneC@aol.com    Posted to fatfree digest V96 #273    Date: Thu, 3 Oct 1996 13:36:43 -0700    From: "Ruth C.
