Preheat the oven to 300F. Slice the top from the head of garlic and remove  most of the papery outer skin from the head, but do not peel or separate  into cloves. Place in a small ovenproof dish.         Pour the olive oil  over the top and add the vinegar and rosemary.  \Cover with aluminum foil  and bake until very tender, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and let  cool.        NOTE -  Prepare 1/2 loaf of whole wheat Italian bread: cut diagonally  into 1/2 inch-thick slices.        Preheat the oven to 350F. Squeeze the softened garlic from the skins  into a saucepan, and add the broth and wine. Heat to a simmer over  medium-low heat and cook for 15 minutes.         While cooking, make the  herb toast. Bake the bread slices on a baking sheet until crisp but not  golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Rub the bread with the cut sides of the garlic  clove, then brush generously with oil. Sprinkle on a thin layer of the  Parmesan cheese and chives. Bake until the cheese is melted, another 5  minutes. Serve immediately with the hot soup. Substitution for the Chinese  garlic chives: 1 clove garlic and twice as much volumn of fresh chives.
