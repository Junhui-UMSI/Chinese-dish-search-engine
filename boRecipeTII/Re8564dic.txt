Sift flour, baking powder & salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the  flour mixture. Add eggs, oil & water. Mix. Gather dough into a ball & roll  out on a lightly-floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch  circles with a cookie cutter. Filling: Combine onion, butter, potatoes  (instant mashed potatoes work fine), 1 egg, salt, nutmeg & pepper until  well blended. Preheat oven to 375. Place a tablespoon of filling on half  the pastry circles. Place remaining circles on top, pressing edges  together. Combine remaining egg & milk. Brush tops of circles with egg-milk  mixture, place pastries on greased baking sheet & bake for 35 minutes.  Makes about 20 pastries.    MRS.
