Following are a number of Guatemalan recipes from a book I received for  Christmas called The book of Latin Americn Cooking.  I havent tried them  so I cant say how theyll be.    Put chicken pieaces into a heavy skillet or casserole.  If using fresh  pineapple, be carefule and save all the juice.  If using canned pineapple,  use the juice. Add all the rest of the ingredients, including salt and  pepper to taste. If usinf fresh pineapple it may be necessary to add  chicken stock to cover the chicken pieces as the fresh fruit will not have  as much juice as the canned.

Serve with rice  From archives of rec.food.recipes    Date: Wed, 8 Feb 1995 22:48:45 GMT    From: goodrich@raisinets.den.mmc.com (Maggie Goodrich)
