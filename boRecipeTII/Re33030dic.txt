Basic Cold Bean Curd
Soy sauce, Bean curd cakes, Peanut oil, Pepper, Water, 
1. Cut each cake of bean curd in 4 to 6 slices. Meanwhile bring water to  a boil.       2. Carefully place bean curd slices, a few at a time, in a sieve. Plunge  into boiling water for 30 seconds; then drain. Arrange on a serving platter  and let cool.       3. Mix soy sauce and peanut oil and pour over bean curd. Serve,  sprinkled with pepper.       NOTE: Bean curd is already cooked and can be eaten as is. The blanching  improves its flavor and texture.       VARIATIONS: For the soy sauce, substitute oyster sauce.       For the peanut oil, substitute 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil. After step 2,  top bean curd with 1/4 cup dried shrimp (soaked) or 2 tablespoons cooked  shrimp, chopped coarsely; and 2 tablespoons scallion, minced. Season as in  step 3, but omit pepper. Then refrigerate, covered, only to chill (about 20  minutes).       In step 3, use mixture as a dip instead of pouring it directly over bean  curd.       In step 3, sprinkle the bean curd with the soy sauce and pepper. Garnish  with 1/2 cup Chinese parsley, chopped, and 2 scallion stalks, shredded.  Then heat the oil until smoking and pour over.
