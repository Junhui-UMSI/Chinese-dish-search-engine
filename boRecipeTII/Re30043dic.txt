Balmy Banana Bake
Unsalted butter, bananas, Juice of 3 limes, Light brown sugar, 
This recipe calls for slightly underripe bananas because, as they  cook, theyll soften up quite a bit. Lime juice keeps the bananas from  discoloring, so they are easily made ahead through step 3. The sweet  and tangy combination is just right served after your jazzy meal.    1. Preheat oven to 375F.    2. Butter a shallow baking dish; reserve remaining butter.    3. Peel and layer bananas in the buttered dish and drizzle with lime  juice.    4. Sprinkle with sugar and dot bananas with remaining butter. Bake  for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with sauce. Remove bananas from  dish carefully with a long spatula. Serve hot, with sauce spooned on  top.    Per serving: 149 calories, 4 grams fat, 8 milligrams cholesterol.
