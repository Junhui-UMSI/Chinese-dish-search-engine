Tropical Scones
Granulated sugar, Salt, Coconut, shredded, White chocolate, 1/2 inch, All-purpose flour, milk, Baking Powder, Dried pineapple, chopped, Vanilla extract, Egg, Macadamia nuts, chopped, Dried papaya, chopped, Unsalted butter, chilled, 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly butter a 9 inch diameter circle in the  center of a baking sheet.    In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes and distribute them over the flour  mixture. With a pastry blender or two knives used scissors fashion, cut in  the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, stir  together the milk, egg, and vanilla. Add the milk mixture to the flour  mixture and stir to combine. Stir in the papaya, pineapple, macadamia nuts,  coconut, and white chocolate until evenly distributed.    With lightly floured hands, pat the dough into a 8 inch circle in the  center of the prepared baking sheet. With a serrated knife, cut into 8  wedges. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and a  cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of a scone comes out  clean.    Remove the baking sheet to a wire rack and cool for 5 minutes. Using a  spatula, transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool. Recut into wedges, if  necesary. Serve warm, or cool completely and store in an airtight  container. These freeze well.
