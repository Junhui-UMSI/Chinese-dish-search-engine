Avocado-Tomatillo Sauce
Medium-to-large tomatillos*;, Onion; minced, Salt to taste, Or more habaneros; minced,, Lime juice; or to taste, Ripe avocados; peeled,, As many garlic cloves as you, 
Since there seems to be something of a "green recipe" thread running  through the list at the moment, I thought Id submit a favorite of mine.  This derives from the "Habanero Cookbook," by Dave DeWitt and Nancy  Gerlach, where it was introduced as a sauce for fish.    * If using fresh tomatillos, husk them, then boil about 10 min. or until  soft in unsalted water. Let cool and chop. If using canned tomatillos, they  can be chopped and added directly to the mix. I prefer the slightly sharper  taste of fresh ones if you can get them...    Combine avocados, chopped tomatillos, habaneros and garlic in a food  processor and mix well. Add lime juice and blend until desired consistency  is reached. Add salt, taste and adjust if necessary.    Depending on the ripeness of the avocados, the juiciness of the tomatillos,  and the amount of lime juice added, this sauce can vary from chunky and  pale green to quite runny and dark green. Its very good on top of hearty  fish like swordfish or tuna, and its great with chicken, but Ive also  made it alone as a dip for parties.    Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST by "Jonathan T.
