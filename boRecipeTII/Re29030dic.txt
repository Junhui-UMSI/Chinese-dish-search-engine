Baked Polenta
Polenta, Salt, Grated parmesan or romano, Stick butter; melted -or-, olive oil, Water, 
This recipe illustrates an interesting bit of history. Corn came from the  New World and was taken to Italy. Our beloved cornmeal mush be came known  as polenta in Italy, and while in Italy Mr. Jefferson learned a new trick.  He brought this recipe back with him and evidently served it often at the  plantation.      Bring the water to a boil. Add the salt and slowly stir in the polenta.  Stir constantly to avoid lumps. After the mixture begins to thicken you can  stir less frequently. Simmer for about 20 minutes or until very thick. Pour  into a greased loaf mold or bread pan. Allow to cool in the refrigerator  overnight.      Cut into 1/4-inch slices and layer like tiles in a baking dish. Pour the  butter or oil over the top and then the cheese. Bake in 375? ovens for  about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and all begins to brown  just a bit.    INCLUDES OVERNIGHT CHILLING TIME    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.
