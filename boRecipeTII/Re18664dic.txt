The batter will expand during fermenting. The use of  metal utinsils or bowls will spoil the fermenting process. STARTER: 1c.  flour, 1c. milk, 1c. sugar, mix well with wooden spoon. (if a friend has  given you a jar of starter mix, you do not need to make the above starter  mix. Just begin with "Day 1".) Day 1: Do Nothing. Day 2: Stir with wooden  spoon. Day 3: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 4: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 5:  Stir with wooden spoon. Day 6: Add, 1c. flour, 1c. milk, 1c. sugar, mix  well with wooden spoon. Day 7: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 8: Stir with  wooden spoon. Day 9: Stir with wooden spoon. Day 10: Add, 1c. flour, 1c.  milk, 1c. sugar, mix well and pour into 3 separate jars. Give two jars of  starter to friends with this recipe. Keep the third jar to bake the  following: In a large bowl, add 1c. oil,      1/2    c. milk, 3 eggs, 1 ts vanilla, and mix thoroughly. In a separate  bowl, mix 2 c. flour, 1 c. sugar, 1 1/2 ts baking powder, 2 ts cinnamon,  1/2 ts salt, 1/2 ts baking soda, 1 c. chopped pecans, 1 small box Instant  Vanilla Pudding and mix well. Add dry indredients to wet ingredients and  mix thoroughly. Grease 2 loaf pans and sprinkle with a Sugar/Cinnamon mix.  Pour batter into loaf pans and sprinkle some extra Sugar/Cinnamon on top.  Bake in 325 degree oven for one hour. Cool and remove from pans. This is  sinfully delicious................    MC-Recipe Digest V1 #184    From the MasterCook recipe list.
