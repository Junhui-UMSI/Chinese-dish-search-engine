Small zucchini (about 1 inch in diameter) make the best pickles, but  over-grown ones can make satisfactory pickles if they are halved, seeded,  then cut into half-rings. I prefer to use the dill heads before they are  completely mature and dry because of their soft flavor and appearance. Trim  the ends from the zucchini and slice about 3/8 inch thick. Halve the onions  lengthwise, then slice them crosswise about 1/4 inch thick. Layer the  vegetables in a glass, ceramic, or stainless steel bowl, sprinkling each  layer with salt.  Cover with ice water. Place a plate on top of the  vegetables and a weight on the plate. Let stand for 2 hours. Drain the  zucchini and onions and rinse well.  Drain again while you prepare the  pickling liquid. Mix the vinegar, water, sugar, and mustard in a large  nonreactive pan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan from the heat, add the dill heads or seed and the zucchini  and onions, and cover. Let the mixture stand for 2 hours, tossing  occasionally. Meanwhile, fill a canning kettle with enough water to cover  pint jars and bring the water to a boil. Sterilize four pint jars and scald  four lids and rings. Bring the zucchini mixture to a boil in its pan and  stir in the garlic and dill leaves. Ladle into hot, sterilized pint jars.  Cover with lids and rings and process in the boiling water bath according  to manufacturers directions for 10 minutes at sea level. Store the pickles  for a week at room temperature before using. If any jars do not seal, store  them in the refrigerator and use the contents within 2 weeks.
