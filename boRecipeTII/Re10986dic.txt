Radioactive Punch
See below, 
Easiest is to mix something yellow with something blue. Orange juice  and Mountain Dew are good for the yellow, Great Bluedini kool-aid is  good for the blue. Youll end up with a radioactive shade of green.  If youre using a punch bowl, try this: Get some of those latex  gloves, fill them with water or juice tinted with food colouring,  freeze. Unmold carefully and float the disembodied hands in the punch  bowl. Dry ice and back lighting are good for effect too.    NOTE FROM LINDA GROSS: "If you try the water in the gloves trick, be  careful because the fingers are fragile and snap off easily, but that  could add to the effect if you drizzle red food coloring on the  "wound"!"
