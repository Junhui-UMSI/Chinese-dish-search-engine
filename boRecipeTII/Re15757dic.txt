Cook spinach for 1/2 hour; drain well. Add remaining ingredients, except  oysters; mix well. Drain oysters; put on flat sheet and broil long enough  to get rid of excess water (until the edges curl). To make casserole: Put  half of spinach mixture in casserole; then layer oysters and cover with  remaining mixture. If making individual servings, do same in cup cake  molds, using enough oysters to cover mold. Bake for 25 minutes in 350  degree oven. May be frozen and reheated.
