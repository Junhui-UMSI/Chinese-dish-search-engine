If you ever need an ice  cream topping, I guarantee this is the best one ever.    The recipe is from "A Taste of Aloha" and its entitled "Fresh Strawberries  "No Ka Oi".  No Ka Oi means "the best" ... and it is!    Combine sugar, whipping cream, corn syrup and butter in a saucepan.  Bring  to a boil and boil 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Chop frozen Heath bars  into small pcs. (bars may be placed in a plastic bag, then broken into bits  with a hammer -- or purchase the Heath bar pcs.)    Stir in Heath Bars to cooked mixture.  Cool slightly.  For each serving,  place desired amount of strawberries into dessert bowl.  Top with warm  mixture and garnish with sour cream.
