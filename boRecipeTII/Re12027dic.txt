Zimtsterne
Salt, Lemonjuice, Powdered sugar, Eggwhites, Almonds unpeeled, Cinnamon, 
Clean the almonds in a kitchentowel.Grind the almonds throug a mill or buy  already grind almonds.Whip eggwhite with salt until stiff.Add pwd. sugar  while still whipping eggwhite and also add the juice of the lemon by the  drop while still whipping.Take 4 Tbsp. from the mixture,cover and set  aside.Add 1 Lb of almonds and the cinnamon carefully under the  eggmixturer.Sprinkle the remaining almonds on a workingsurface.Place the  dough in small portions on it.(dough will brake easy).Roll out 1" thick and  use your Starcutter medium size.Take a cookiesheet and cover with  pergamentpaper or aluminumfoil.Grease with margarine.Place the zimtsterne  on cookiesheet and brush with the eggmixturer you set aside earlier. Bake  in preheated oven on the middle shelf for 25 min. at 325. When you cut the  zimtsterne out of the dough use the space very good because the remainung  dough can not be used again,sorry.I just roll the dough in small balls and  press them down with a fork and bake.After baking take the zimtsterne  carefully of the paper and let cool on rack.Store in airtight containers.
