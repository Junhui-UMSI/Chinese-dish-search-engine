Rajas
Queso ranchero, Salt, cilantro, Mexican cream, Poblano chiles, Vegetable oil, Onions, Garlic, 
Rajas can be eaten either as a taco filling or as a vegetable side dish to  a fairly bland main course. I like them with sausages. Queso ranchero is a  Mexican cheese that is tangy, mildly salty and melts softly. It--and many  other Mexican dairy products, including the slightly sour cream--is  available in almost all supermarkets these days. Cacique makes a  particularly good one. Roast peppers either under broiler, on grill or over  gas burner until skin begins to blacken, about 10 minutes. Place in bowl  and cover with damp towel to finish steaming. When cool, peel thin,  blackened skin and discard. Remove seeds and stems and tear flesh into  coarse shreds. Cut onions in half, then in half-moons less than 1/4 inch  thick. Combine in skillet with oil and cook, covered, over low heat until  onions have thoroughly wilted and softened and are beginning to brown, 15  to 20 minutes. Remove cover and raise heat to medium. Add garlic and 1  tablespoon cilantro and cook until garlic is soft, about 5 minutes. Add  pepper shreds and heat through, about 5 more minutes. Just before serving,  add cream, stir to combine and cook just long enough to thicken, 1 to 2  minutes. Add salt, plus more to taste if necessary. Do not over-salt;  cheese is somewhat salty. Remove from heat and add crumbled cheese and more  chopped cilantro to taste.    Note: Sour cream thinned with a little milk can sub for the Mexican cream.  I would use Monterey jack cheese, but dont know if its the best  substitute. Posted to CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #363 by Judy Howle  <howle@ebicom.net> on Jun 22, 1995
