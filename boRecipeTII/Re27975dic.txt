Three Corn Casserole
whole kernel corn , Sour cream, cream style corn , corn muffin mix, Butter or Margarine, Egg, 
Preheat oven to 375 F. Mix butter, sour cream and egg together. Stir in  both cans of corn. Blend in dry muffin mix. Spoon into well-greased or Pam  sprayed large casserole dish. Mixture puffs up quite a bit while baking so  use a larger dish than you think it needs. Bake 1 hour until puffed up and  crisp on top.    NOTES : Very good.
