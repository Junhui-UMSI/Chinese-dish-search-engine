Baked Beef Potpie
Onion, frozen mixed vegetables, Garlic powder, condensed cream, Hamburger, milk, Bisquick, 
Source: Vergie Ewing    Fry hamburger and chopped onion together; drain and put mixture in an  ungreased 9x13 inch baking pan. In a separate bowl, put the frozen mixed  vegetables, garlic powder, cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of the milk. Mix  well and pour over the hamburger-onion mixture. Mix together the Bisquick  and remaining 1 1/2 cup of milk (will be thin). Pour over the mixture in  the pan. Bake at 450 degrees until crust is golden brown. (It took about 40  minutes for me, but ovens vary).    You could use diced chicken, turkey, or ham, or tuna instead of the ground  beef.
