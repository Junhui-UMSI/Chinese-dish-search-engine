Place all ingredients, except the potatoes, in a large saucepan & bring to  a boil.  Cover, reduce heat & simmer until the vegetables & barley are  tender, about 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F. Transfer the cooked  mixture to a lightly oiled casserole dish & top with alternate diagonal  rows of both kinds of potato. (For a more decorative look, try piping the  potatoes).
