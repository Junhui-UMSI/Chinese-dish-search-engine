Banana and Pomegranate Salad
Bananas, Pomegranates, Stephen Ceideburg, Palm Sugar, Lime Dressing, Juice of 2 limes, 
This is a side-dish from the north of India. It makes a refreshing and  pretty contrast to a highly spiced dish and couldnt be simpler. Try it  next time you are having a curry meal, or use it as one of several salads  for entertaining.    Mix together the juice of 2 limes and a tablespoon of palm sugar (or  substitute brown sugar). Taste and adjust for sweet- sour balance if  necessary. Cut 2 pomegranates which have been chilling in the fridge into  quarters and twist each wedge to help free the seeds. Coax them out and  mound them in the centre of a serving dish. Slice 3 bananas and arrange  them around the peri- meter of the pomegranate seeds. Sprinkle with the  lime dressing and serve.
