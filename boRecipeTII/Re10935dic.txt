Add mayonaisse and salt and wisk together  with a fork until blended.  Peel, and slice the fruit. Sprinkle with lemon  juice.    Rachel says that she uses only enough to glaze the fruit, about one fourth  of the recipe. rachel_frey@baylor.edu    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /FRUIT    From rec.food.cooking archives.
