Its a variation on a recipe from the Betty Crocker Microwave Cookbook. Im  sure it could be done on top of the stove instead of in the microwave.  It  just needs to simmer long enough to let the bulgar absorb the liquid.  The  original recipe called for ground beef.  For those who are still  meat-eaters, use 1/2 lb. instead of the TVP, water, ketchup and Kitchen  Bouquet.  Ground turkey would also work.    Mix TVP with boiling water, ketchup and Kitchen Bouquet and let stand 10  minutes.  Put onion and garlic in a 1 quart casserole and microwave,  covered, on High for 1 minute. Add TVP mixture and rest of ingredients  except for cheese and stir. Microwave, covered, on Medium for 15 minutes,  or until liquid is absorbed. Stir. Top with cheese and let stand several  minutes. Makes 2 or 3 servings.    Variation: change the seasonings to 2 tsp chili powder and 1 tsp ground  cumin and add chopped green pepper with the onion and garlic to make  Spanish Bulgar (instead of Spanish Rice).    You could also use this for a filling for stuffed peppers.    And, since I know someone will ask: TVP stands for textured vegetable  protein.  It is made from soybeans and makes a reasonably good substitute  for ground beef, especially in things with a sauce. Its cheap and also  very low fat. You can buy it at a natural foods store. You can also use it  to replace part of the meat in a recipe if you want to cut back on meat,  but not give it up entirely.    EAT-L DIGEST 19 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
