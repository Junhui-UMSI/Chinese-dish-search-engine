Veal Shanks Osso Buco
Bay Leaves, Lemon juice, Veal shanks, Dry white wine, fresh thyme, fresh parsley, Unsalted butter, Celery, Salt, Lemon zest, Orange zest, Hot beef and veal stock, Onion, olive oil, Gremolada, carrots, Orange juice, garlic, Canned plum tomatoes, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.    Season the veal with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil and butter  together in a large, heavy skillet and sear the veal shanks over high heat  on all sides until well browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the browned veal  shanks from the skillet and place them in an ovenproof casserole. To the  same skillet to which you browned the veal add the diced vegetables, along  with the garlic and saute them for 3 to 4 minutes.    When the vegetables have begun to cook and wilt, add the white wine and  deglaze the pan. Add the two zests and juices and allow to reduce for  several minutes. Then add the tomatoes and allow to boil before carefully  pouring over veal shanks in the casserole.    Add the hot stock and the herbs to the casserole and braise, covered for 1  hour and 45 minutes. The veal should be fork tender, with the meat just  beginning to separate from the bone when you move them from the oven. Do  not remove until fork tender. After you have removed the veal from the  vegetable sauce, stir in the gremolada and allow to be warmed through by  the vegetable sauce. Serve veal shanks with some of the sauce spooned over  the top.    Cool for 10 minutes before serving.    Yield: 4 servings    NOTES : Guest host: Michael Lomonaco    Recipe by: Cooking Live Show #CL8845 Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #536 by  Angele Freeman <jfreeman@netusa1.net> on Mar 22, 1997
