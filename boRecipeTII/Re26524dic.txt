Scrub potatoes thoroughly and prick with a fork. Arrange on a  microwave-safe plate. Microwave, uncovered, on 100 percent power (high) for  17 to 22 minutes or till almost tender, rearranging once. (Or, bake  potatoes in a 425? F. oven for 40 to 45 minutes or till tender.) Cool.    Halve each potato lengthwise. Scoop out the inside of each potato half,  leaving about a 1/4-inch-thick shell. (Cover and chill the leftover fluffy  white part of potatoes for another use.) Combine the cooking oil, chili  powder, and hot pepper sauce. With a pastry brush, brush the insides of the  potato halves with the oil mixture. Cut the potato halves in half  lengthwise. Return to the baking sheet.    Sprinkle potato quarters with bacon, tomato, and green onion. Top with  cheese. If desired, cover and chill for up to 24 hours.    Bake in 450? F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes or till cheese is melted and  potato quarters are heated through. Serve with sour cream, if desired.  Makes 24 wedges.    Make-Ahead Tip: Up to 24 hours ahead, prepare potato wedges, but do not  bake. Cover and chill. To serve, bake potato wedges as directed.
