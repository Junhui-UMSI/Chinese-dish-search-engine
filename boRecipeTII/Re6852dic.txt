Put one  meatball and one pineapple chunk on skewer and return to baking dish.  (I just dump them in the baking dish, as I put them all in a serving  bowl.) Brush with sweet & sour sauce. (I just dump the sauce on and  toss.) Bake for 5 to 8 minutes more. (Bake chilled meatballs for 10  minutes.) Heat remaining sauce and serve with meatballs.
