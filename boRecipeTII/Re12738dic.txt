Your Basic Burger
Onion powder, Salt to taste, Ground beef, Pepper, 
Using a fork, gently mix meat, salt, onion powder and pepper. Shape  into 6 patties, handling meat as little as possible and taking care  not to press meat together tightly.    Broil, grill or pan-fry the patties. The length of cooking time will  depend upon whether you and your guests like your hamburgers rare,  medium or well done.
