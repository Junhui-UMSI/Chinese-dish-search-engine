I use it in our whole grain breads,  waffles, pancakes, muffins, and cookies:    1. Cover prunes with water and bring to a boil.  Cool.    2. Blend prunes, water, lecithin, and citric acid in blender til smooth.  3. Pour in clean quart jar and refrigerate. Should keep up to 30 days. Can  be frozen. Use as a fat and egg substitute for cooking, baking and salad  dressings. According to the directions on the jar of the commercial  Wonderslim, 1/4 C of WonderSlim replaces 1/2 C of butter, oil or margarine.  Personally, I use whatever seems to make my recipe look and/or "feel" right    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #51    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
