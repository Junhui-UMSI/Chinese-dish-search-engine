Baked Mussels
mussels, Crushed tomatoes, Garlic, Parsley, Bread crumbs, cheese, 
Scrub mussels with a brush, pull off beards. Prepare a fry pan with a tight  fitting lid that will hold all the mussels. Add 3-4 T olive oil, 1/3 cup  water, salt, and pepper. Cover pan, let mussels steam over medium heat to  open. Meanwhile combine bread crumbs, grated cheese, and garlic cloves, to  use as stuffing. Remove mussels to cool and reserve liquid. Do not use  unopened mussels. Remove mussels and open shells to lay flat. Do not break  apart. Place one mussel in each shell, cover with prepared stuffing.  Squeeze 1 T of crushed tomatoes on each mussel. Sprinkle with chopped  parsley. Drizzle with olive oil and remaining liquid from steam process to  moisten bread crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees until golden brown, about 15-20  minutes. Serve hot.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Paula <demoness@bellatlantic.net> on Sep  03, 1998
