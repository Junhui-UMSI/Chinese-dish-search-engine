Tori No Mizutaki (Chicken Stew)
Tofu; press, drain,, Kikkoman soy sauce, Lemon, DIPPING SAUCE, Spring onions; cut in 2", Shirataki; (or substitute, Carrots; diagonal thin, Drumsticks; chopped in 1", Whole dried shiitake, Sheet 2"x6" kombu seaweed;, Rice vinegar, Watercress, Chinese cabbage; cut in 2", 
Add 1 inch of water to a 12-inch table-top skillet (electric or gas,  whatever is available). Add the kombu and boil. Just before it starts to  actually boil, remove the kombu. If you are using dashi powder, add it now  (tsk, tsk...). If you soaked the shiitake mushrooms, dump that water in  here, too. Anyway, just put whatever you want to eat in the water to cook  it until ready. Serve with dipping sauce (just mix whats shown above) and  lots of steamed rice. It will make you very warm.    If you have the luxury of obtaining shichimi togarashi, sprinkle in a bit  for added flavour.    When you are finished, dump some rice into the remaining water and cook  gently to make congee. Its soooo good in the morning.    Copyright (c) Ken Iisaka. May be distributed freely provided this copyright  notice is not removed.
