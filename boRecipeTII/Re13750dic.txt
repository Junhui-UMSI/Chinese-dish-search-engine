Wild Rice Stuffing
Butter, The Giblets, Celery, Onion, Thyme, Sage, Salad oil, Parsley, Boiling Chicken Broth, Walnuts, Salt, Black Pepper, Wild Rice, 
Melt the butter with the oil in a heavy skillet or large saucepan and saute  the onion until soft.  Add the rice and cook, stirring often, until  slightly colored. Add the walnuts, cook for 5 minutes, then add the celery,  and cook until the rice is golden. Stir in the herbs and seasonings and the  giblets.    Pour on the boiling liquid, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about  30 minutes, and the rice is just barely done.    Amounts may be adjusted to the size of the bird.  This recipe should stuff  a 15-lb turkey.
