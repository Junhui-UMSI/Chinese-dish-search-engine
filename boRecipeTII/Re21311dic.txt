Cold Mashed Potatoes, Cracked black pepper, Scallions, chopped, milk, Eggs, Ground nutmeg, Butter, Cheddar Cheese, Salt, 
A) Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Generously butter 2 (6 cup) Muffin pans.    B) Warm the milk and butter to just below boiling point in a small pan,  then mix thoroughly into the spuds with the cheese, scallions, and  seasonings. Mix in the egg yolks and beat thoroughly.    C) Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Mix 2 Tbsp of the whites thoroughly  into the spud mixture to loosen it, then fold the rest of the whites  through the spuds as lightly as possible.    D) Spoon the mixture into the muffin pans and bake for about 15 minutes,  until they have risen to a Golden-Brown. Serve immediately. Cest Bon!
