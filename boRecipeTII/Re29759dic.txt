Pico de Gallo:  Combine garlic, onion, tomato and cilantro in a bowl. Add  serrano pepper and salt to taste. Set aside.    Fajitas: Whisk together garlic and lime juice and pour over tempeh in a  flat dish. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for several hours,  turning tempeh occasionally.    Drain tempeh. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium-sized skillet over moderate  heat. Brown tempeh on both sides, adding an additional tablespoon oil if  necessary. Add stock or water and cover pan tightly. Steam until liquid is  almost absorbed, then add soy sauce and turn tempeh to coat. Cover and cook  away remaining liquid. Remove tempeh from pan and cut into thin strips.    Wrap tortillas in aluminum foil or place in a tightly covered pan. Warm in  a moderate oven for several minutes. Remove from oven. Arrange tempeh  strips down the middle of each tortilla, spoon Pico de Gallo on top, and  fold or roll up. Serve immediately with extra sauce. Makes 4 fajitas.
