Or 1 Large Head Fennel, Sugar, Tomato Puree, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Red Mullet; Scaled And, Puff Pastry, Parsley; Finely Chopped, Salt and pepper, Gen. Tablesp Basil; Finely, Capers; Finely Chopped, Garlic, 
Season the red mullet fillets and set aside. Trim the fennel, reserving the  feathery fronds to use as a garnish. Halve the fennel lengthwise, then  slice finely. Put into a pan with one tablespoon of the oil, one tablespoon  of water and a little salt. Cover and sweat gently for 5 to 10 minutes  until tender. Drain and reserve. Mix the basil, parsley, capers, garlic,  tomato puree and sugar with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. Roll the puff  pastry out very thinly and cut out 4 x 20 cm circles. Lay them on oiled  baking sheets and prick. Brush or smear the olive oil and herb mixture over  the circles, leaving a 1 cm border all around the edge. Now divide the  fennel between the circles - it should cover them more or less, but dont  heap it up. Cut the fillets into strips, wipe them dry and arrange skin  side up over the fennel, pressing down gently. Brush the red mullet, fennel  and edges of pastry with olive oil.    Bake at 230 C or 450 F for 5 minutes, whip out of the oven, brush the edges  of the pastry with olive oil again, then return to the oven for a further 5  minutes until the fish is just cooked through. Serve immediately, scattered  with fennel greenery.

It requires last       minute assembly and cooking, but the results justify the bother.
