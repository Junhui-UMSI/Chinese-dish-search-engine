"My husband and I enjoy this chili often.  I learned to make it in a high  school home economics class.  One thing I like is that it uses beef stew  meat rather than the usual ground beef. And it sure lives up to its name!"  ~ Lori Pfeifer Heat oil in Dutch oven; brown beef on all sides. Drain well  on paper towels. Cook onions and garlic in oil; return meat to pan. Add the  tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, sugar, oregano, chili powder, salt and red  pepper.  Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; simmer 1 1/2 hours.  Add kidney beans and green and red pepper. Simmer, covered, until meat is  tender.    From:  "Prize-Winning Beef" Recipe booklet. Posted on Prodigy by Debbie  Carlson.
