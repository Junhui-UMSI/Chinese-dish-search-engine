Meanwhile, slice the mushrooms, red onions and green peppers, and  make a nice macedoine (mixture). Leave the tomatoes out. Remove tempeh from  the marinade; slice lengthwise about 1/4-inch thick and put back in  marinade. Layer tempeh out on a sheet pan with parchment paper and bake in  a convection oven at 300 degrees for 15 minutes, then flip strips and cook  for additional 10 minutes (or cook in a conventional oven at 350 degree for  15 minutes for each side). Remove the pan from the oven and let tempeh  cool.
