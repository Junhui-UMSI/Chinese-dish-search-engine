Stuffed Monster Zucchini
Lentils, Thyme, Celery, Cumin, Giant zucchini, Garlic, Rice, Onion, 
This is of general interest, so Ill post it.  I, too, was recently given a  giant zucchini, big enough to effectively bludgeon someone. (ironically  enough, I got it in a butcher shop my dad dragged me in to.) I sliced it in  half horizontally, scooped out the seeds, and stuffed it with cooked rice  and lentils and baked it.  Put some lentils in a pot with water and boil  them until barely soft.  Throw in some rice and cook until barely done,  using as little water as possible. Meanwhile, sautee some celery, onion and  garlic (not too much garlic.) and add that to the rice and lentils, along  with some ground cumin and thyme. Throw it on the zucchini and bake at  around 350 or 400 until the zucchini is soft. The surface of the stuffing  will probably get burned and dried out, but you van just brush it aside.
