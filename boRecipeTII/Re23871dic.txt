Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute the  garlic, ginger and red bell pepper until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in  the chopped mushroom stems and the bok choy. Cook until the mushrooms are  tender and the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes more. Remove the pan  from the heat, and stir in the sesame oil, tamari salt, bread crumbs, chili  paste, scallions, and lemon juice. Using a teaspoon, stuff the mushroom  caps with the filling. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the caps are  tender. Serve immediately.
