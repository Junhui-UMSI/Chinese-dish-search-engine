1.In a small bowl, stir together saffron and water and set aside. Peel  potato, halve lengthwise, and cut into 1/8-inch slices. Place slices in a  microwave-safe bowl, cover with water, and microwave until soft, but not  falling apart, about 5 minutes.    2. While potato is cooking, brush a 10-inch non-stick skillet with olive  oil and set over medium-high heat. Add onion, red pepper, zucchini, and  garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and transfer contents of skillet into a large bowl.    3. Preheat broiler. Drain potatoes and add to bowl. In another bowl, whisk  egg whites and saffron (with soaking water) until frothy. Pour over  vegetables and mix to combine.    4. Re-heat skillet over medium heat and pour in egg-vegetable mixture.  Press down vegetables with a spatula and dot top with olive halves. Cook  without stirring until eggs are set, but still moist on top, about 4  minutes. Remove pan from stove top and place under broiler until top is set  and golden brown, about 1 minute. Remove from broiler and slide onto  serving dish. Serve at room temperature.
