Another recipe from "A Passion for Potatoes" by Lydie Marshall.    In a pan, cover the potatoes with cold salted water. Bring to a boil,  partially cover, and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender.    Drain and mash the potatoes with a potato masher, ricer, or through a  strainer. You should have 2 cups of loosely packed mashed potatoes.    Combine the potatoes and scallions; season with salt and pepper. Set aside  to cool.    Dust a work surface with flour and cut the puff pastry in half. Refrigerate  one half while you roll the other into a 12-inch by 18-inch rectangle.  Transfer to a cookie sheet and refrigerate for half hour to firm up the  dough.    Cut six 3-by 2 1/2-inch rectangles from each piece of dough and once more  refrigerate, placing wax paper between each layer.    For each knish, mound 2 tablespoons of well-packed potato mixture in the  upper half of the rectangle. Lightly brush water on the outer 1/8 inch of  the pastry. Fold the pastry over the potato stuffing and seal the edges,  pushing down with the back of a fork.    Put the knishes on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and  refrigerate until ready to bake. They can be prepared several hours ahead.    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.    Bake the knishes in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turning them over  once. They should be golden brown. Serve warm.    Posted to recipelu-digest by ncanty@juno.com (Nadia I Canty) on Mar 1, 1998
