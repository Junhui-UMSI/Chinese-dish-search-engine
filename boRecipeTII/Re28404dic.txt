It was so good, I asked for the recipe. Low fat, its  not, but I have had some success using lower fat ingredients such as milk  and sour cream, though I wouldnt bother with nonfat sour cream. I also use  less cheddar than this recipe calls for...or I double everything except the  sour cream and cheddar. Whatever works...its the best version Ive ever  eaten.
