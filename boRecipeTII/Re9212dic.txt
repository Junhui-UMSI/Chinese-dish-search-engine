This is from the Los Angeles Times food section, from "Hot to Cook a Wolf"    Heat heavy, deep pan. Add roast, turning to brown on all sides. Season to  taste with salt and pepper. Add prunes, onion, garlic and 2 cups water.  Cover and simer until meat is tender, 3 to 4 hours.    Remove meat to hot platter. Stir in vinegar,brown sugar, cloves and  cinnamon into liquid left in pan. Cook rapidly until sauce thickens. Pour  sauce over and around meat. Serve with noodles.    (I added a large can of cut-up tomatoes, and then stirred in Wondra flour  to thicken.)    Posted to Digest eat-lf.v097.n014 by Barbara McCormack  <heyheybobbie@earthlink.net> on Jan 15, 1998
