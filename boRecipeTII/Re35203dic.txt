*    Hamburger buns should be split and toasted. Cook and stir the meat,  onion and celery in a large skillet until the meat is brown. Drain off the  excess fat. Stir in the cabbage, green pepper, catsup, water, salt, and  mustard and heat to boiling, stirring occasionally. Reduce the heat and  cover.  Simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Spoon the  mixture onto the bottom halves of the buns and top with the remaining  halves.    NOTE:    For Sloppy Joes, omit the cabbage and salt.
