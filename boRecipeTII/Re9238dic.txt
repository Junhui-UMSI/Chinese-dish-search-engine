Puak Koan (Taro Conserve)
Yams, Coconut milk, Taro, VARIANT 1, VARIANT 2, Palm sugar, Palm sugar, Water, 
This is in fact two related recipes, both of which have the same name, and  which are regional variations on the same recipe. A third variation exists,  in which the syrup of the first recipe is used with the preparation method  of the second. Though normally made with taro, these recipes can be  prepared with any of the varieties of sweet potatoe available in Thailand  as well.    Variant 1: Method: Peel the yams and cut them into 1" pieces, and then  steam until cooked (about 20 minutes), and tender. Mash to a fine puree.    WArm the coconut milk (but do not boil), and dissolve the palm sugar in it.  Then add it a few spoons at a time to the taro puree, mixing thoroughly.  Force this mixture into a saucepan through a fine seive or chinoise to  remove any lumps, and stir over medium-low heat until it forms a workable  dough like consistency (that is until most of the excess moisture is driven  off).    Spread on a shallow baking tin or cookie tray about 8 inches square, and  allow to cool. Cut into 1" squares.    Serve with fruit, or eat as candies.    Variant 2: Method: Cut the taro into thin slices (about a quarter of an  inch thick), and deep fry until golden brown.    In a saucepan heat the water until just boiling, and add the palm sugar,  stirring until dissolved. Then continue to boil, stirring occasionally,  until reduced to a syrup like consistency.    Drop the fried taro into the syrop and coat liberally, then spread to cool  and dry on a cook cooling rack.    Eat as a candy like dessert.
