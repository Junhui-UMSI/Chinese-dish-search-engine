Wayward Wontons
Cream Cheese, Green Onion, Garlic powder, Crabmeat, canned, Wonton Squares, 
Mix crabmeat, softened cream cheese, onion, and garlic. Put a spoonful of  the mixture into each wonton and fold over. Deep fry until light brown and  crisp.    As far as servings go, it made about 20 stuffed wontons and still had ample  wontons left over for the next batch.
