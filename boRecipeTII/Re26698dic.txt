Baileys Ice Cream
salt, Castor sugar, Heavy Cream, Baileys, Full fat milk, 
Whisk all of this stuff together until all the sugar has been dissolved.    Then freeze as you would normally freeze ice cream, either in an ice cream  maker or in a tub in the freezer whisking every half hour or so.    Because of the alcohol content of this ice cream it will usually take  around 12 hours to become hard.  It does freeze hard so taking it out the  freezer 10 minutes before serving is advised.  It does melt quickly so you  have to eat it fast.    Dont put any more Baileys into the mix.  1/2 a cup may not seem much but  the flavour comes through very strongly.    I prefer this with a little Baileys poured over it.    Make it and enjoy it.  That is an order!  Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #256 by Matt <recipes@cableinet.co.uk> on  Sep 17, 1997
