Tony Romas Ribs
Salt, Brown sugar, Chili powder, Paprika, Racks baby back ribs, Onion powder, Fresh ground pepper, Cayenne pepper, Your favorite BBQ sauce, 
Combine all dry ingredients in bowl. There will be more of this wonderful  mix than you need. Save it in a zip lock bag in a cool dark place. You can  use it on any pork with wonderful results.    The night before you intend to serve the ribs, coat the ribs in all the  spice mix you can (until it falls off). Place ribs in zip lock bag and put  in refrigerator.    The day you wish to serve the ribs, remove them from the refrigerator seven  hours (thats right 7 hours) before you want to eat and add more spice mix  as above. Preheat your oven to 225 degrees F (THATS RIGHT! TWO HUNDRED AND  TWENTY FIVE DEGREES!). Six hours before serving, place ribs on a shallow  pan and place in oven fat side up. You now have five hours to make side  dishes and goodies to go with your ribs. Use this time wisely. I usually  watch football. After five hours, coat both sides of the ribs with your  favorite sauce. Continue cooking, adding more sauce in another half an  hour. After six hours of "low and slow" cooking, you should be able to pull  a nice shiny rib bone right out of the rack of ribs with no meat attached.  This is when they are done. If you cant do this yet, put on more sauce,  continue to cook and tell your family that the wait will be worth it. It  will!    It took me a long time to perfect this method. It is a combination of  common smoking knowledge, a good spice mixture, and a few tasty mistakes. I  hope your family enjoys it as much as mine.
