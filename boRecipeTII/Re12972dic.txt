Zesty Oil Free Salad Dressing
Tomato sauce, Evaporated skimmed milk, Wine or cider vinegar, *sugar or nutrasweet to, Lemon juice, Chopped parsley, Salt, Taste -- optional, Onions, Pepper, 
Mix together all ingredients in a jar with lid, shake and serve.  Keeps  will in fridge. I like to serve this with Grape Nut Croutons. I know, I  know..it sounds gross....but tastes good. Take one cup Grape Nuts and saute  with low fat or fat free margarine substitute and season with garlic salt,  pepper and mustard about 2 or 3 minutes. Let cool and sprinkle on salad as  you would croutons.
