The Best Soft Pretzel Recipe in the World
Hot water, Coarse kosher salt, Active dry yeast, Flour, Baking soda, Warm water, Brown sugar, 
In a large mixing bowl, mix warm water and yeast til dissolved. Stir in  warm water and brown sugar. Slowly add 5 cups of flour to mixture. You can  knead the dough with a dough hook and a mixer or your hands, I prefer to  start with a mixer and finish up by hand. Use extra flour to keep it from  sticking to you or the board. Work it until its stretchy and smooth.  Should not be sticky.    Grease two large cookie sheets. Pre-heat oven to 475 degrees. Fill a 2-3  qt. saucepan half-full of water. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda for every  cup of water. Bring to a boil.    Now pinch off a golf-ball size piece of dough, roll into rope as thick as  thumb. Bend into U-shape. Cross ends, twist cross ends, making full turn,  then fold ends back toward middle of U. Press ends into dough firmly. You  should now have the familiar pretzel shape.(Dont worry it takes some  practice, besides the shape doesnt affect the taste. I make all sorts of  shapes, and candy canes for Christmas.)    Now lower pretzel gently into boiling water for 30 seconds, then place on  greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with kosher salt. When all dough has been  boiled, bake for 8 minutes, or until golden.    Serve with mustard or cheese spread (Wispride, Kaukana)    This dough makes a great pizza crust too. (Just let rise for 1/2 hour,  dont boil it.)    Formatted by Brenda Adams. I found this on net (have not made it). It was  posted 12-30-95 by Steven D Johnson. The above notes are his.    MC post 9/19/97.
