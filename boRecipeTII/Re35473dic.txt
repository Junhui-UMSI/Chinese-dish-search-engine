Recipe by: timpson@acetek.cs.mci.com (Steven D. Timpson) I make Jerky by  buying about 5+ lbs of beef. Usually a roast. I then remove the fat. Place  the strips of meat into marinade and let soak for about 24 hours. Remove  from marinade and allow to air dry for at least one hour. If you have a  meat smoker then omit the liquid smoke and smoke meat at a low temperature.
