salt and pepper, Vegetable oil, Green peppers, Ham hock, Dried black beans, Onion, Tomatoes, 
PLACE THE BEANS in a pot and fill it with water 4 inches above the beans.  Add the ham hock, cover and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce  heat to low and simmer for 3 hours. Add water as necessary during the  cooking so that the beans are always barely covered. Remove cover during  the last hour and let the liquid thicken a bit. Add salt and pepper at the  end. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet, add the onion and peppers and  cook until soft, about 7 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook another minute.  When its time to serve the beans, mix the onion, pepper and tomatoes to  the beans.
