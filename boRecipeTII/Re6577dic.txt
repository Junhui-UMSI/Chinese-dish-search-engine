To prepare scallops, rinse and drain them and place on wooden skewers. Put  butter, green onion and spices in large shallow pan. Stir and cook until  onion is soft. Add wine and enough water to cover scallops when placed in  pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Add scallops on their wooden  picks and cook gently, but do not boil, for about 3 to 4 minutes. For  sauce, place peppers in baking pan and bake in a 450 oven, turning often  until skins are blistered and black, about 35 minutes. Place peppers in a  plastic bag. When cool, peel off skins and remove stem and seeds. Whirl  peppers in a blender with broth and wine until smooth. Pour mixture into  pan. Add basil. Boil until reduced. Add butter, a little at a time,  stirring constantly to incorporate. Serve sauce under scallops. Makes 6  servings.
