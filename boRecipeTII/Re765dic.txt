Combine all filling ingredients the night prior and put in refrigerator.    Soften yeast in the water and set aside to proof.  Combine one cup flour,  the sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Beat in the softened yeast and  add oil.  Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately stiff  dough.  Knead for five to eight minutes on a floured surface until dough is  smooth and elastic.  Place in a greased bowl. Let rise in warm place for  about one hour or until the dough doubles. Punch dough down and divide in  two pieces.  Roll each piece of dough into a 13 inch circle. Place one  circle on a greased 12 inch pizza pan. Spread the filling on top and cover  with remaining circle. Trim and flute the edges. Prick the top of the crust  with a fork several times.  Cover loosely with foil and bake in a preheated      350    degree oven for 45 minutes.    Remove from oven, remove foil. Combine glaze ingredients and brush on pie  crust.  Return to oven and bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.    Serve warm or cold.
