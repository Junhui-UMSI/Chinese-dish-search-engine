Strawberry-Rubarb Compote
FROZEN RUBARB, FROZEN WHOLE STRAWBERRIES, 
Place in a pot, cover 1/4 way with orange juice and another 1/4 water.  Bring to a boil and immedietly lower flame to a simmer. Allow to simmer  until rubarb is VERY soft. Add lots of sugar and some vanilla sugar as  well. I know this sounds like overkill but I put in a package of strawberry  jello as well (it makes a big difference). Taste to make sure it is sweet  enough and allow to cool.    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by "Aliza Blizinsky" <alizab@hotmail.com> on  Feb 17, 1998
