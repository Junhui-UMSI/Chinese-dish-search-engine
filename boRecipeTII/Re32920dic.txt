1. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat, add sausage, and cook,  browning on all sides, for about 15 minutes. Remove sausage from pan, cut  into large pieces, and set aside.    2. Reduce heat to medium-low, add onions and cook until soft, about 20  minutes. Add carrots, celery, and parsley and cook, stirring occasionally,  for about 10 minutes. Add garlic and oregano and cook for 2 minutes more.    3. Return sausage to skillet. Add beans and enough water to cover, about 3  cups. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, reduce heat to medium-low and  cook until beans are just tender, about 40 minutes. Uncover, increase heat  to medium-high, and reduce liquid by half, about 10 minutes. Add broccoli  rabe, mix well, cover, and cook until rabe is tender, 5-7 minutes. Season  with salt and pepper, then transfer to a large bowl and serve.    Notes: Cranberry beans are usually only found in autumn. If you cook this  in another season, substitute white beans.
