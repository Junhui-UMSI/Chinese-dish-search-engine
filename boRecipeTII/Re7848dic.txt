Portuguese Pot Roast

I have a UN cookbook from 1964. Each member country submitted traditional  recipes (or so the intro says). Theres a pot roast recipe that sounds  similar. Maybe vinudage is a technique. This recipe calls for "Rump roast"  which I think of as "beef" . The recipe also calls for "FAT" (we used lard  or crisco/spry) In the 70s we grabbed corn oil, then.... ;-D    (Carne Assada a Portuguesa)    Marinate the roast for at least 24 hours in sauce of red wine, 2 of the  onions, garlic, salt, and pepper (in refrigerator). Turn meat occasionally.  Cook remaining sliced onion in hot fat in Dutch oven or heavy kettle with  lid, until onion is brown; remove onion and save. Brown drained and dried  roast on all sides in hot fat; add browned onion and marinade to roast; add  water to cover approximately 2/3 of the meat. Cover tightly; simmer,  turning meat occasionally, for 4 to 4-1/2 hours or until meat is fork  tender. During last hour of cooking add sliced tomatoes; remove cover  during last 30 minutes. Sauce can be strained and thickened, if desired.  Yield 8-10 servings. Posted to Kitmailbox Digest by PATh  <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on Apr 04, 1997
