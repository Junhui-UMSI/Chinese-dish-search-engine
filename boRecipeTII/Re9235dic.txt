As you can see by previous Greek bread recipes, the Greek Housewives made  plenty of bread. These recipes are directly from Greece and are in fairly  large quantity.However this and other bread recipes can easily be halved  for the smaller hosehold. All yeast breads freeze well too.    Crumble yeast in the warm water and let dissolve. Beat the margarine until  light and mix into the flour and yeast mixture. Then stir in the oil,  sugar, salt, cinnamon, eggs if using ( a lighter baked good ) and the milk,  adding " more if needed"  to produce a kneadable nonsticky dough. Knead  smooth and elastic. Cover in a large bowl and let rise double. Punch down  and let rise double again. Shape into 5 loaves and place in pans. Beat egg  and milk together and brush loaves. Slash top of each bread. Bake 400 for  15 minutes and then 375 for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and done.  Recipe can be halved easily.
