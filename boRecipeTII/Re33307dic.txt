"Seasoned Greetings" -- From the L.A. Times.    The most important ingredients in chili are the spices, and many cooks  jealously guard their special blends. But there is a way you can give away  your chili recipe without giving away the whole thing. Bottle your  seasonings and attach the recipe--without the spice instructions. Tell them  that information is too hot to handle. If you dont have a favorite spice  mix or chili recipe, you can borrow ours.    Chili powder comes in more varieties than basic red. In the Latino sections  of most supermarkets, you can find ground chiles from different kinds of  peppers, including pasilla and California chiles. Combine cumin, pasilla  and California chile powders, salt, basil, oregano, dry mustard, cayenne  pepper and garlic powder. Mix well.        2    cups.
