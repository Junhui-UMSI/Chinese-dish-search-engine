Place flour, eggs and bread crumbs in 3 separate shallow plates. Season  veal with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Dredge veal in  flour and shake off excess. Then dip floured veal in eggs and then in bread  crumbs; set crumbed mixture on a rack for coating to set. In a large  skillet heat 1/4-inch deep vegetable oil. When hot, add the veal without  crowding in a batch and cook for 3 minutes a side. With a slotted spatula  transfer the veal to a baking sheet. Set first batch in oven to keep warm.  Repeat with a second or third batch until all the veal is done. Keep the  veal warm in the low oven while you eat your first course. When ready to  eat, center greens on a dinner plate. Cut veal into strips on the diagonal  and pile in the center. Garnish with salsa.
