Ravine Brownies
Unsweetened Chocolate, Sugar, Eggs -- well beaten, Vanilla, Squares, Pecans, Butter, Flour -- sifted, 
Melt chocolate and butter together. Cool thoroughly. Add sugar, eggs,  flour, vanilla and nuts. Beat well. Spread evenly in greased pan (8x8  inches). Bake in 350F oven for 15 to 20 minute, or until done. Test with a  toothpick; if tester comes out sticky but not doughy -- brownies are done.  They will be soft and chewy.
