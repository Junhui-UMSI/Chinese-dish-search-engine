Boil and cube the potatoes. Wash the greens, shred into fine strands and  set  aside. Heat a good non-stick pan and add the mustard seeds. As soon as  they  start spluttering, add the asafetida, fry for a couple of seconds and  then ad  the cayenne/chili powder and turmeric and continue sauteeing  adding a bit of  liquid if it sticks. If dried fenugreek leaves are used,  crush them a bit  and add at this point. Add the cubed potatoes, salt and  sugar and reduce the  flame to medium. Saute potatoes without adding any  more liquid till a nice  crust forms around them. Now start adding the  shredded greens, a little at a  time. Continue sauteeing till all the  liquid is absorbed and the greens are a l wilted.

You will be surprised at how strongly bitter the spice is if you  use it in larger amounts. I could post my recipe for curry powder using  fenugreek if anybody wants it, I generally use this powder to make a spicy  lentil stew called sambhar.
