From Rose Elliots *The Complete Vegetarian Cuisine*.     Preheat the oven to 375 f. Grease a 2 lb loaf pan with butter and line  with buttered alum foil to cover the base of the pan and the narrow sides.  Sprinkle with dried breadcrumbs.      Saute the onion in the 4 tbls of butter for 10 minutes. Add the thyme and  flour and cook for a minute or two, then add milk and stir until thickened.  Remove from heat and add nuts and breadcrumbs. Season well with salt,pepper  and nutmeg.  Beat the eggwhites until stiff but not dry and fold in.  Make  the stuffing by thoroughly mixing the ingredients together(she doesnt say  to but I melt the butter) and season to taste with salt and pepper.     Spoon half the nut mixture into the pan in an even layer.  Form the  stuffing into a flat layer that will fit on top of the nut mixture.Put on  top of nut mixture. Cover the stuffing with the rest of the nut mixture.  Level top and cover with buttered foil and bake for 1 -1 1/2 hours until  firm in center.(remove foil for last 15 minutes). Let it stand for 5  minutes slip a knife around the edges and invert on serving dish.    JMUSE@NORWICH.EARN    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
