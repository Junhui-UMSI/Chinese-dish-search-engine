Big Oatmeal Cookies with Dates and Nuts
milk, Brown sugar, Almond extract, Dates, Granulated sugar, Allspice, Salt, Walnuts, Sweetened coconut, Sesame seeds, Butter, Eggs, Flour, Cinnamon, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Rolled oats, 
Cover a flat baking sheet w/parchment if possible; tinfoil if necessary. If  you use tinfoil, butter it generously. Preheat oven to 375. Cream the  butter with the sugars until light and fluffy; the sugar neednt be  completely dissolved but it should be very well mixed in. Beat the eggs  w/milk and almond extract until the mixture is foamy. Sift the flour  w/spices, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure all the  embellishments are ready. Using a wooden spoon, work about half the flour  mixture into the butter and sugar. Add the milk and egg mixture and combine  well. Then add the rest of the flour mixture and, as soon as the dough is  smooth, the oats, dates, nuts, coconut, and sesame seeds. Give each  addition about 2 stirs before adding the next, but dont wait until each is  well mixed. Stir only enough to ensure proper distribution of the goodies  at the end. Put golf ball-sized dollops of the dough on the lined baking  sheet, spacing them about 8" apart. Use a knife blade to flatten and spread  the dough into 3.1/2" circles (which will spread a bit in the oven). Be  sure they arent more than 1/4" thick. Bake the cookies 8 mins., then  reverse the sheet so they brown evenly and lower the heat to 350~. Bake  another 5 to 8 mins. or until the cookies are nicely browned and a broken  one is dry in the center. They will be soft when they come out of the oven,  but will become chewy, w/crisp edges, as they cool. Cool on a wire rack.
