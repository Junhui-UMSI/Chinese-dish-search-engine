Yellow Sauce for Pulled Pork
Cider vinegar, Honey, Salt, yellow prepared mustard, Brown sugar, black pepper, Red hot pepper flakes, 
Heat all in a sauce pan on low for approx. 30 min, whisking while heating.  The honey and mustard I start with a 1/4 cup and than just add by taste. It  usually ends up somewhere less than 1/2 a cup. The pepper flakes are the  kind you would sprinkle on pizza. I smash them so piece doesnt get stuck  in a judges teeth and starts to burn. I use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of  finished sauce to a 6 lb. pulled butt.    Recipe by: Don Martin <doncdt@tiac.net>    Posted to bbq-digest V5 #792 by RockMc <RockMc@aol.com> on Dec 29, 1997
