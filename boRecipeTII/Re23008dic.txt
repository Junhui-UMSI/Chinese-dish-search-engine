You will probably need a grill basket for this recipe. Marinate the fish by  combining marinade ingreds. Place marinade and fish in a well-sealed baggie  and let sit at room temp. for 1 hour. Turn several times so that marinade  will touch fish inside and out.  Remove fish from marinade and lightly pat  outsides of fish with paper towels. Salt and pepper insides of fish well,  then put 2 slices of crisply cooked bacon inside each fish. Wrap each fish  completely in half-cooked bacon, using 5 slices per fish. Fasten bacon  strips with round wooden toothpicks. Arrange fish in a grill basket. Place  grill basket on prepared grill and cook for about 5 minutes on each side or  until brown. Bacon should be crisp. Transfer fish to serving platter and  serve. Pass lemon wedges. Gourmet Fish on the Grill formatted by Judy  Garnett for M-M.
