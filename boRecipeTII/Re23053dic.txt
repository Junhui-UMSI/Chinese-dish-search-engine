Cut fat into the flour with a pastry blender or 2 knives or an electric  mixer until the mixture is blended and forms lumps the size of peas. Rub  mixture between your fingers until you have a fine grained texture. Add  just enough ice water to make it stick together and quickly knead it into a  smooth and shiny ball. Speed is important. Cover and refrigerate for 60  minutes before rolling out. Halve the kidneys and remove film and fatty  core.  Dice the kidneys and steak very fine. Peel and chop the vegetables  equally as fine. Mix well in a bowl with parsley and spices. Preheat the  oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out the unsweetened pastry to a thickness of  1/8 inch and cut into 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Put a spoonful of  the meat mixture in the center of the rounds. Paint the edges lightly with  water.  Cover with the remaining rounds, pinching the edges together very  firmly.  Prick well with a fork.  Place on a baking sheet and paint with  the egg.  Bake 30 minutes.
