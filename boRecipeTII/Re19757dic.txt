"Dont let the name Biscuits fool you.  These rich and crunchy cookies  are presumably of Australian origin, which may explain the name."    Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and make a well in the center.  Melt  butter and syrup.  Add soda mixed with boiling water, then pour this  mixture into dry ingredients.    Mix to a moist but firm consistency.  Drop by tablespoonfuls onto cold  greased cookie sheet.  Bake at 250 degrees F. about 20 minutes.
