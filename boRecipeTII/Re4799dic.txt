"Use this piquant version in place of regular catsup to spice up  sandwiches, meatloaf, or hamburgers.   Since this catsup freezes well, it is a great way to use all those fresh  tomatoes."     Cook the tomatoes for 15 minutes and then drain off the excess liquid. Add  the celery, onion, bell pepper, and chiles and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or  until it is reduced by one half.     Add the sugar, vinegar, and spices and simmer for an additional hour.  Remove from the heat and puree until smooth.     Pack in freezer containers, leaving 1/2 inch head space, and freeze. Makes        4    pints.     From The Whole Chile Pepper Book  page 62 Formatted to MM by J.Duckett1  (Kat)
