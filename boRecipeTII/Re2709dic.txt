Green gumdrops, Cake decorator flowers, Creamy peanut butter, Shortening, Miniature peanut butter, milk, Sugar; divided, Egg, Vanilla extract, All purpose flour, Salt, Brown sugar, Baking soda, 
Flatten the gumdrops; cut into small leaf shapes and set aside. In a mixing  bowl, cream peanut butter, shortening, 1/2 cup sugar and brown sugar. Add  the egg, milk and vanilla; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and  salt; add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Shape into 1 inch balls.  Roll in remaining sugar; place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 for  10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven and  immediately lightly press one peanut butter cup, cut side down, into each  cookie to form a basket. Press a candy flower onto cookie so it appears as  if a flower is coming out of the basket; press gumdrop leaves next to  flowers. Cool on wire racks. Yield about 5 dozen.
