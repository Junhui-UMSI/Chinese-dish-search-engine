Sour cream, Fresh dill, Baby red potatoes, Walnut halves, 
Cook potatoes in boiling water for 8 to 12 minutes until just tender. Drain  and cool.  Slice off the bottom end of each potato so it sits upright and  slice off a third of the top. (If potaotes are medium small cut them in  half and use both halves) With a melon baller, scoop out the potato and  fill with a dollop of sour cream. Top with walnut halves and tuck in a  sprig of dill.
