Keep washing until water no longer milky. [note:  some people omit washing as it washes away some of the nutrients] Put rice  in a sieve over an empty bowl and let the rice drain for one hour.    Put the rice in a heavy, 2-1/2 qt. pot w/a well-fitting lid.  Add 2-1/2 c.  water, cover, and bring to a boil over a med. flame.  When steam begins to  escape, turn heat to *very* low and cook for 20 min.  Turn heat to high for  3 seconds and then turn it OFF. Let sit, covered and undisturbed, for 15  mins. Do not lift lid at any stage.    SUSHI RICE: Mix the rice, wine vinegar, sugar and salt together thoroughly  in a cup.  As soon as the rice has completed its cooking, including its  resting period, empty it out onto a large platter or baking tray.    1.  Pour the seasonings in the cup over it    2.  Now fan the rice with one hand (you could use a magazine for this)  while you mix it with a dampened wooden paddle or spoon. Continue to do  this until the rice has reached room temp. Put rice in covered pot or bowl  to prevent it from drying out. Do not refrigerate. The rice will hold for a  few hours, though the fresher the rice the better.    There you are.  I do refrigerate it-- if it is going to last more than that  day.  After all,  6 cups goes a long way!    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #64    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
