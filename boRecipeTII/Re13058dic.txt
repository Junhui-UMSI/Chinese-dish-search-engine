WINTER VEGETATABLE STEW WITH CHEDDAR AND CROUTONS: A hearty, flavorful stew  for healthy appetites. And its vitamin A is okay, courtesy of carrots and  broccoli. Use a 5 to 6 quart cooker. Makes 4 servings.    Combine the potatoes, turnips, carrots, celery, leek, broth, savory and  pepper in an electric slow cooker. Cover and cook on LOW until the  vegetables are tender, 7 to 9 hours (or on HIGH for 4 to 6 hours).    Add the broccoli. Cover and cook until the broccoli is tender, about 15  minutes or longer. Divide the stew among 4 bowls; top each serving with  croutons, cheese, and bacon-flavored bits. Per serving with regular cheddar  cheese: 320 calories, 11 g fat (30% of calories), 6.3 saturated fat, 30 mg  cholesterol, 604 mg sodium, 3.8 g dietary fiber. McEstimates with at-free  cheddar and store bought croutons: PER SERVING: 232 cals, 3.7 g fat (15.3%  cff).    To make toasted croutons, cut 3 slices of crusty bread into 1/2-inch cubes.  Spread the cubes on a baking sheet or perforated pizza pan. Mist the cubes  with nonstick spray, then broil them until theyre golden, about 5 minutes.  shake or stir cubes to expose the uncooked sides; broil them until golden,  about 3 minutes.
