Valeries Tuna Casserole
Box Macaroni and Cheese, Tuna in water; drained (or, Seasoned bread crumbs;, milk, Cream of mushroom soup; (or, Shredded cheddar cheese;, 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cook macaroni and cheese according to  directions on the box. Add tuna, soup, milk (yes, 1/2 cup *more* milk) and  1 cup of the cheese. You may use less cheese if desired, or omit entirely  if you really want to. It does add more of a homemade flavor though. Stir  well and pour into a casserole dish. Toss remaining cheese with bread  crumbs. Use your judgement on the amount, and you can increase the amount  of cheese desired as well. Make enough to nicely cover your casserole dish.  Sprinkle cheese/crumb mixture over your casserole. Bake for 15 - 20  minutes, or until topping bubbles and gets a nice *light* brown colour to  it.    NOTES : *Not* your typical Tuna Casserole, imo.  Original recipe taken fro=  m The Starving Students Cookbook by Dede Napoli, but Ive modified it so  cl= aim it as my own. ;-)  Recipe by: Val=E9rie Whittle    Posted to recipelu-digest by "Valerie Whittle" <catspaw@inetnow.net> on Feb  7, 1998
