When gelatin is dissolved, stir it and then blend into  the cranberry mixture. Put mixture into a mold. You will need a 3-quart  mold that has been lightly oiled for this recipe. Do not use olive oil.  Chill mixture until slightly set.    Chicken layer: 4. Repeat for gelatin as in first layer. Blend together the  mayonnaise, evaporated milk, salt and pepper. Stir in the dissolved  gelatin. Fold in the chicken, celery and parsley. 5. When first layer is  slightly set (the consistency of unbeaten egg whites) turn the chicken  mixture onto the cranberry layer. 6. Refrigerate until firm. Unmold onto  chilled serving platter, decorated with curly lettuce if you prefer. Serve  with additional mayonnaise.
