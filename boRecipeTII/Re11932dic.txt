My little sister Laura just got a bread machine (Panasonic) just like mine.  This is especially for her, but also for anyone else who loves good plain  warm hot home-made bread. This is my familys absolute favorite ABM  bread.....    1. Place flour, dry milk, salt, sugar, butter, potato flakes, and turmeric  to the breadmaker basket.    2. Add buttermilk and water to basket. Place basket in bread machine.    3. Place yeast in yeast dispenser.    4. Set maker for basic bread, sandwich mode. This will take 4 hours.    Laura, and friends....this is Rebekahs favorite type of bread that I make  in the ABM. Last weekend, I made a loaf for her to take back to college  with her. It doesnt last more than about 3 days on the shelf (no  preservatives), but it never lasts that long here.    the pale yellow color makes pretty sandwiches. This is great for French  Toast.    If you use regular all-purpose flour, youll still get a good loaf, but it  will be more dense---not enough gluten to make it raise as well. Posted to  EAT-L Digest 14 Apr 97 by "Sharon H.
