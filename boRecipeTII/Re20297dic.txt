It takes gourmet recipes kosher and not  kosher and turns them all kosher.    1. Saute veal chops in a small amount of cooking oil until brown. Set  aside.    2. Sautee eggplant in cooking oil, drain on paper towels and set aside.  Reserve oil.    3. To assemble:in a casserole layer sauce, eggplant, sauce, breadcrumbs,  veal chops. Now top with sauce, eggplant and sauce again.    4. Cover sauce with 1/4 inch layer of bread crumbs. Sprinkle with oil used  to saute eggplant.    5. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 45 minuts.    Eggplant absorbs a great quantity of oil, you might have to add more.  Do  be patient as after it is absorbed, iat is then released.    JEWISH-FOOD digest 252    From the Jewish Food recipe list.
