Slice tops of tomatoes & scoop out their insides.  Reserve for another  use.  Set tomatoes on a platter.    In a large bowl, toss together the remaining ingredients.  Spoon into  the tomatoes, serve or wrap & store in the refrigerator overnight to  allow the flavours to develop.  Any leftover slaw will keep  refrigerated in a covered container, for 2 days.
