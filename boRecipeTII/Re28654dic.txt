Texas Enchiladas (Chili, Cheese, and Onion)
onions, Corn tortillas, longhorn cheddar, Vegetable oil, 
After youve made the chili, preheat the oven to 350?. Heat the oil in a  skillet on medium heat. With tongs, carefully swipe each tortilla through  the grease, no more than 2 seconds. Drag the tortilla over the side of the  skillet, removing the excess grease, and stack the tortillas on a warm  plate. One by one, dip the tortillas into the chili and stack them again on  the plate.    Fill the center of all 8 tortillas with some of the cheese and onions.  Spread the fillings from end to end, then tightly roll up each tortilla.    Arrange the enchiladas in a 12-inch oven-proof dish. Spread the rest of the  chili over the tortillas, and sprinkle more cheese on top. Bake the  enchiladas for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted.  Serve right away.
