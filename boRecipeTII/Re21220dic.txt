Udon
Flakes, shiitake mushrooms), Instant powder -- dried, Dashi -- how you like ie:, Sake, 14 Tbsp, Bonita, 4 Tbsp, Salt -- to taste, Soy sauce -- just for color, Pork -- sliced, 
Brown pork, add remaining ingredients.  Simmer for 10 minutes serve with  favorite condiments. This recipe can be used for both soba and udon. The  pork makes it non-vegan but gives the broth a wonderful flavor. I cant eat  udon at restaurants because they never taste as good as my mothers. Im  sorry but measurements are approximate. I never measure when I make this...  A bad habit I picked up from my mother. If you want exact measurements,  e-mail me and Ill measure everything the next time I make it.
