From: MarkandSue@highland.cix.co.uk (Mark and Sue Thomas)    These are a bit like Danish Pastries but without the yeast dough. You can  use either filling or both together. Cut pastry into 16 squares, 3" by 3".  On each square, cut in diagonally from each corner, leaving an area in the  centre that is uncut, about 1 inch across. Put a teaspoonful of either or  both fillings in the centre. Take one corner and fold it to the middle.  Move to the next triangle, and fold in one corner. Do this for each of the  4 triangles, so you have a pinwheel shape. Four corners meet in the middle  on top of the apple, and 4 are left flat. This is easier to do than to  explain! Use a fish slice to lift onto a greased or lined tray, and paint  with milk or egg and milk if you have any. Bake at 190 C, 375 F for 20  minutes until the points are golden brown. To make custard: Mix all  together and either microwave for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, or cook  over a low heat in a saucepan until thickened. It will taste a bit raw at  this stage, but will be fine after baking.    Recipe by: Sue Thomas    Posted to recipelu-digest by jeryder@juno.com on Mar 17, 1998
