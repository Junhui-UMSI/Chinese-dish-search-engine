Sweet Potatoes, Soul-Style
Sugar, Dark sweet potatoes, Water, Butter, 
SERVES 6-8      These are the most delicious sweet potatoes you can imagine. With all of  this butter and sugar they should be! Ms. Helen Vallard, "Louise-anna born  and raised," cooks at a very good soul-food restaurant in Seattle called  Southern Comfort. This is her recipe, and when she gave it to me I really  thought there was some mistake in terms of the amount of sugar. This will  work well, and it is very simple. The dish makes its own syrup and it will  be a hit with your family year-round.      Rinse the potato slices in ample water and drain. Place in a 2-quart  covered saucepan and add the water, sugar, and butter. Cover and simmer  until very tender, about 30 minutes. Do not stir during the cooking  process.
