Emmenthaler is a dry, aged cheese that accents the flavor of asparagus.  Serve as the main course of a light lunch or supper.    PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Snap coarse ends off asparagus stalks leaving spears  about 3 1/2-inches long. (Save the trimmed-off ends to use for soup.) Peel  the asparagus spears using a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, lay them flat  in a large heavy skillet, pour in boiling salted water and set over  moderate heat. Cover and cook asparagus for about 10 minutes, until very  tender. Drain well, return to the skillet and shake over moderate heat for  30 seconds or so to dissipate any excess moisture. Arrange the asparagus  spears like the spokes of a wheel over the bottom of the pie crust, with  their tips pointing toward the center. Combine the milk, cream, eggs,  Parmesan cheese, Kirschwasser, salt, dill, mace and pepper, and pour the  liquid evenly over the asparagus. Bake the tart, uncovered, for 35 minutes,  or until the filling has set. Remove the tart from the oven and cool it for  at least 20 minutes before cutting.
