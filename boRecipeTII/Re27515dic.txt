I found this recipe in our local Jewish Times and fixed it for dinner  tonight. My husband loved it . The recipe calls for Fish Sauce. The bottle  I have is not Kosher but the main ingredient is anchovies. A touch of  anchovy paste or even 1 chopped anchovy would be a good substitute. I dont  think the recipe would suffer if totally left out!    Spray non-stick pan with vegetable spray. Saute fish fillets until cooked  and browned about 3 minutes each side. Remove fish from pan and keep warm.    Add green onions and 1 TBS water to the pan and simmer until soft. Add  garlic, ginger and 2 TBS water and cook for 2 more minutes.    Add soy sauce, sugar or rice wine , lemon juice, fish sauce and chili (and  pepper) and simmer for 1 minute. Spoon sauce over fish and serve.
