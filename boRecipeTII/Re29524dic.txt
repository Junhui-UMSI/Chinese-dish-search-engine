In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients, whisking until smooth. Adjust  the seasoning with additional salt and/or lemon juice. Refrigerate until  needed. The flavor improves on standing. The dressing will keep for up to a  week.    Yield: About 2 1/2 cups.    Hill and Barclay write: "This creamy, low-fat dressing lends itself to  salad greens, cooked or raw vegetable combinations, pasta and grain salads,  or as a dipping sauce for crudites or steamed artichoke leaves. It may be  prepared with low-fat mayonnaise instead of yogurt for a richer flavor."
