Yogurt Sour Cream
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Plain yogurt*, 
*Dannon brand or other plain yoghurts that do not have gelatin added as a  thickener. Place in a sieve lined with damp muslin and drained in the  refrigerator - In 4 to 6 hours the yoghurt will loose at least half its  volume. To each 8 oz of strained yoghurt - whisk in about 1 Tbl. of extra  virgin olive oil - to take off the edge and give the yoghurt a beautiful  creamy texture - This is a great substitue for sour cream.
