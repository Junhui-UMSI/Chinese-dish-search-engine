1. Drained canned beans, rinse thoroughly with water, and drain again.    2. Cook green beans by trimming and dropping into a pot of boiling water.     Do not cover the pot. Stir the beans occasionally so they cook evenly.     Cooking takes 5-15 minutes; or until desired crunch is obtained.     Drain, pat dry, and cut into 2-inch lengths.    3. Toss canned and fresh beans together in a large bowl. Pour in dressing,     sprinkle on the scallions, and toss again.    4. Cover and refrigerate overnight before serving. Garnish with chopped     parsley. Serve at room temperature.    Garlic Dressing:    1. Combine egg yolk, vinegar, sugar, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste     in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Process     briefly.    2. With the motor running, slowly dribble in the olive oil.    3. Taste, correct seasoning if necessary, and transfer to storage     container.
