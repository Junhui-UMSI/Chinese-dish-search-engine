Baked Fish Fillets with Veggies
LORI WILEN--DGWN58B-----, 
I take fish fillets (any kind) and put them in an oven proof dish. I cover  with Green Giant vegetable mixtures (any kind that you prefer or their  pasta accents) and then add 1/2 can of tomatoes. I bake in an oven warmed  to 350 for about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and serve  with rice, baked potato, pasta or just a salad. Its delicious and doesnt  cost any optional calories.    2 oz. cooked fish = 1 protein selection.    This is my own concoction for fish but I cooked it for my sister-in-law and  she loved it.  Im not much of a fish eater but with 2 for 1 on the  protein, its becoming more popular in my diet plans. Lori in MD.
