I modified a recipe given a while back (one which  originally was given with meat and oil), and it turned out really tasty.    Brown flour in 350 F oven in pan for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes  until the color of caramel.  Meanwhile, reconstitute the TVP in 1 c.  boiling water, with 2 Tbsp. cajun sauce & 1 tsp. "chicken" vegetarian  bouillion. Let TVP sit, covered, for 10 minutes to soak in the flavors.  Saute vegies in 1/4 c. vegetable broth until onions are tender. Add browned  flour, stirring constantly, until all vegies are coated. Add 2 qts. hot  water and stir well. Add remaining ingredients, including the TVP and its  soaking liquid, except for the rice. Reduce heat to simmer, and cook for 1  hour, stirring occasionally. Add rice, and cook for 15 minutes more, until  the broth begins to thicken. Serve with a crusty loaf of bread & a green  salad.

I like Tony Cacheres seasoning -- its the best. I  also have a request -- does anyone have a good recipe for scones which is  vlf, but doesnt taste spongy?  I miss a good flaky scone with my tea in  the morning, and would love a good recipe which is low fat. I havent had  much success in modifying my recipes. TIA!
