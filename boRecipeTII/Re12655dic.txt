Mix and shape into chestnut-size  meatballs. Set aside. Chop remaining onion and brown it in 1/3 cup oil in a  large pot. Add 1-1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and turmeric. Pour  in 10 cups water and add the chick-peas and lentils. Cover and simmer for  35 minutes over medium heat. Add rice and meatballs and simmer 25 minutes  more. Add chopped herbs, spinach and turnips and cook another 50 minutes,  stirring occasionally. Check to see if peas and meatballs are done and  adjust seasoning. Cook a bit longer if necessary. Add yogurt, stirring  constantly for 5 minutes to prevent curdling.    Just before serving, reheat soup and prepare *Garnish* by browning 3 cloves  (minced) in remaining oil. Remove from heat and add 1 teaspoon dried mint  flakes. Serve the soup with garnish on top.    Note: This soup is an excellent remedy for a cold (or so I am told!)
