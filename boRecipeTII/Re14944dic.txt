With an electric mixer, beat eggs until frothy (about 3 minutes).  Add  sugar, nutmeg, vanilla and cinnamon, and beat until well blended.  In a  sauce, heat the butter and milk until the butter melts (but do not allow it  to boil).  In a large bowl, mix together raisins, pecans and bread cubes.  Combine the milk and egg mixtures, pour this over the bread and allow it to  soak for 45 minutes.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease  individual ramekins or a large loaf pan.  Add the apple to the bread  pudding, and spoon mixture into the baking container.  Place in oven  immediately reduce heat 300 degrees F and bake for 40 minutes. Increase  heat to 425 degrees F and bake for another 15 minutes until nicely browned.  To make bourbon sauce, combine 2 eggs and icing sugar. Melt butter in a  double broiler, whisk in egg mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until  sugar has melted and sauce has thickened slightly. Allow to cool, and add  bourbon.  Serve over bread pudding.    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmdja006.zip
