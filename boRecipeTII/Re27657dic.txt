The Dr Pepper Marinade (Brisket)
Fresh Ground Pepper, Worcestershire Sauce, Beef Bouillon, Dr. Pepper, BBQ sauce, Lawrys Season Salt, Lime juice, garlic, 
Combine all ingredients. Marinade brisket in juice for 2 days. Early in the  morning of the day you are going to cook, remove brisket from juice and let  sit at room temp. while you get fire ready. I am using a NBBD; have for  about 9 years. Place brisket in smoker, fat side up, and cook for about  12-14 hours at 275-325. I usually start about 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning  and take off about 10:00 or 11:00 that night. Baste during cooking with  leftover juice. Remove brisket from smoker and wrap in foil. Make sure not  to let any holes get in the foil of juice will leak out. Place brisket in  foil in oven and let cook over night at 150-175. About 1:00 or 2:00 the  next afternoon, you got the best tasting, juiciest and most tender brisket  you ever had.    Posted to bbq-digest by Donald R Wallace/RCH/NS/MCI on 98
