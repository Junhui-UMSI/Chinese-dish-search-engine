Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Heat about 2 teaspoons of the oil in a  nonstick frying pan. Add 1 tortilla and fry just until softened and crisped  around the edges. Remove to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm  in the preheated oven. Continue with the remaining tortillas. Wipe out pan.  Add butter and oil. Place over medium-high heat and when the fat is  sizzling, add the bananas. Saute just until golden, turning as needed.  Remove and set aside.    Add the diced ham to the pan and saute until heated through. Remove and set  aside. Add the beans to the pan and cook gently until heated through.    While the beans are heating, mist a nonstick skillet with oil and fry the  eggs.    To assemble: Place 2 warm tortillas on each serving plate. Spread 1/2 cup  black beans over each set of tortillas; place 2 fried eggs on top. Spoon  1/2 cup warm Yucatan Salsa over each set of eggs. Sprinkle equal amounts of  ham and peas over each serving, then top with cheese. Garnish each plate  with a sauteed banana half.    [Serves 4.
