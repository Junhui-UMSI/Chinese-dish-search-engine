Here is the recipe for the cookies that I dropped and crumbled. As I said,  they are quite fragile! The recipe is from The Complete Cookie by Barry  Bluestein and Kevin Morrissey as printed in the Washington Post.    Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl; set  aside.    Break up chocolate and melt it in a microwave oven at full power for 1 1/2  to 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds, or in the top of a double boiler  over simmering water.    Combine the butter and both sugars in a large bowl. Cream until smooth with  an electric mixer at medium speed. Mix in the egg. Stir in the flour  mixture with a wooden spoon. Take care not to stir too much; leave the  mixture crumbly. Remove half the mixture (about 2 cups) to another bowl.    To one half of the mixture, add the orange extract and orange zest,  stirring until a dough forms. Transfer to a sheet of waxed paper and shape  into a 10-by-2-inch log. Roll it up in the waxed paper.    To the other half of the mixture, add the melted chocolate and the vanilla.  Stir until smooth. Shape and wrap as you did the orange log. Refrigerate  both for 20 minutes.    Unwrap the chilled logs and cut each in half lengthwise. Lay an orange half  down on a work surface, cut-side up. Place a chocolate half-log, cut-side  down, on top. Wrap in waxed paper. Repeat with remaining half-logs.  Refrigerate the logs for a minimum of 2 hours.    Preheat the oven to 375F.    Slice the logs into 1/4-inch-thick wafers and place on ungreased baking  sheets. Bake for about 8 minutes, until delicately browned around the  edges. Remove to wire racks to cool.
