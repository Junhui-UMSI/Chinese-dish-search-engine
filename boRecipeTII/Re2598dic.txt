For those of you who dont get this news letter put out by the mining  company I am posting this recipe. It sounds great. This is a very nice  newsletter and I highly recommend it. Comes out once a week.    http://busycooks.miningco.com    The combination of ingredients sounds bizarre, but this recipes makes an  extraordinary, delicious and easy dish.    Slice the pork into thin strips and place in a bowl. Add the dry taco  seasoning mix, and toss to coat. Heat oil in skillet, and add pork,  stirring until browned. Drain.    Add salsa and peach preserves to the skillet. Stir to mix well and lower  heat. Simmer gently, partially covered, for about 15 minutes.    Serve over hot rice.    Yield: 6 servings.
