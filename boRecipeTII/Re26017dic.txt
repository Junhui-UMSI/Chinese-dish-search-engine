Preheat oven to 350    BROWNIE LAYER- Whip together the soymilk and 3T flour. Cook over medium  heat, stirring constantly until thickened. Let cool completely. Beat  together the oil cocoa, sweetener, and vanilla, then beat in the cooled  soymilk and flour mixture. Add 1c flour, soy flour, baking powder, and  salt, and beat until smooth. Spread mixture evenly into a 9" round  spring-form pan.    CHEESECAKE LAYER- Blend the tofu, 1/2c sweetener, 1T flour, lemon juice,  and 2t vanilla in a blender until smooth and creamy. Pour evenly over the  brownie layer, and bake for 1 hour. Cool and serve.    NOTES- I prefere to let it cool several hours or over night. I have used  Low-fat milk for the Soy-milk. Soy Flour- soy flour is available in Natural  Food Stores, and should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer. It is a  heavy flour and may be used in small amounts for baking. It adds moisture  and texture to baked goods; and they tend to turn golden brown more quickly  during baking.
