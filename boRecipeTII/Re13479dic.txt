In a 4-quart saucepan bring 3 quarts salted water to a boil for orzo.    In a heavy saucepan simmer bell peppers in wine and broth with salt,  covered, until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove lid and simmer until liquid  is evaporated. Cool pepper mixture and in a food processor or blender pur?e  with egg substitute. Transfer pepper mixture to a large bowl.    Preheat oven to 350? F.    Cook orzo in boiling salted water until al dente and drain in a colander.  Rinse orzo under cold water and drain well. Stir orzo into pepper mixture  with scallions, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Spread orzo in baking  pan, smoothing top.

Serves 6    Note: the original recipe called for two TBS of parmesan - one mixed in  with the mixture and the other sprinkled on top before baking. As I cant  get fat free parmesan here, I did without, but if you can get hold of it,  it might make a nice addition.
