From: Weikel@Fwva.Saic.Com (MONIKA)    Date: Sat, 04 Dec 1993 22:07:57 GMT  This is a recipe I adapted from Rubios.  It is a big hit with my roomates.  They prefer it to the original.    Fish: Rinse and drain fish, and tear it into slightly larger than bite size  chunks.  Put the flour in a bowl and mix in enough beer to make a foamy  paste. Stir in spices. Use this mixure to coat the fish and fry until  golden.    The sauce:  Mix salsa and mayo and the juice from a lime section. Add a  little water if the mixure is too thick to pour.    Tortillas: Microwave until warm and soft.    Construction: Take a warm tortilla. Spoon some sauce on it to form a line  down the middle.  Place pieces of fried fish on the line and top it with  cabbage.  Fold and serve with a slice of lime.    This makes about five.  The measurements may be off because we are so  addicted to this recipe that Ill make it for days on end until we run out  of ingredients, so leftover ingredients arent a problem for us.
