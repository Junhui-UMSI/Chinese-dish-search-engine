Ayam Goreng Asam (Indonesia) Piquant Fried Chicken
Roasting chicken, Garlic, Ground coriander, Tamarind liquid, Black Pepper, Palm sugar, Oil for frying, Ground turmeric, Salt, 
Cut chicken into small serving pieces. Crush garlic with salt to a smooth  paste and combine with pepper, sugar, coriander, cummin, turmeric and  tamarind liquid. Rub over the chicken pieces and leave for 1 hour, or cover  and marinade in refrigerator overnight. Heat enough oil in a large heavy  frying pan to cover base of pan. Take chicken pieces from marinade and  drain on paper towels to get rid of excess moisture. Put pieces into the  frying pan and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side, turning  with tongs until golden brown. Reduce heat, cover pan and cook for 10-12  minutes longer, turning pieces half-way through. Drain on absorbent paper  and serve warm.    Compiled by Imran C.
