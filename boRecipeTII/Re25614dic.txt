As you cut avocados drizzle lemon juice on them so that they will not  darken. Mash avocados in a bowl and add the mustard and worcestershire  sauce. In a separate bowl lightly whip the 1/2 pint of whipping cream. The  cream should be a little loose, soft peak stage is the technical term. Fold  cream into avocado mixture.   Place parchment paper in a standard bread pan so that there is enough  paper to cover the top of the filled terrine. Spray the parchment with  release spray. Fill the terrine with 1/2 of the mixture, and refrigerate  for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove terrine from refrigerator, slice the extra  avocado and drizzle lemon juice on it to keep it from darkening, place the  slices on the top of the chilled mixture. Pour other 1/2 of the avocado  melange on top. Drizzle some lemon juice on top and fold parchment paper  over top. Refrigerate for 35 to 40 minutes. While the terrine is chilling,  peel devein and barely poach the shrimp, let the shrimp cool in the  poaching liquid if possible. Set the shrimp aside for the garnish. Separate  nice looking basil leaves for garnish.   Prepare the sauce; roughly cut the tomato into bite size pieces, place in  a small frying pan or saucepan and stew them slightly. Add a little lemon  juice and the cream, mix in a few stray leaves of the basil cut into  strips. The goal is to quickly cook off some of the liquid. Let this sauce  cool to room temperature or below before saucing the dishes.   To unmold, sit the terrine in some warm water for 1 minute or less, and  unmold onto a platter. Slice into 3/4 inch thick pieces and place the  shrimp and basil on the plate with the terrine. Spoon some of the basil  rich sauce over the top.
