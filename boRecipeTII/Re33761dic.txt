Combine wine, soy  sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon monosodium glutamate;  mix well.  Pour mixture over fish; marinate 1/2 hour. Prepare Sweet and  Sour Sauce while fish is marinating. Mix together egg and cornstarch to  form stiff batter. Drain fish well; combine with batter.

Drain on paper towels; keep warm. In wok, or large skillet, heat  2 tablespoons oil. Add remaining ingredients and stir fry to 2-4 minutes,  or until vegetables are tender but not limp.
