Pumpkin Crisp
Butter, Cream cheese, pumpkin, evaporated milk, Cinnamon, Eggs, FROSTING, Powdered sugar, yellow cake mix, Sugar, Pecans, Cool whip, 
Line bottom and sides of a 9x13x2 cake pan with wax paper.  You may want to  grease the pan with butter or oil before placing paper on to facilitate  removal of the wax paper after cooking.  Mix pumpkin, milk, sugar,  cinnamon, and eggs with a mixer or by hand.  Pour into the pan.  Sprinkle  the cake mix over the liquid mixture and spread evenly.  Pat nuts into the  cake mix and spoon the melted butter or margarine over the nuts and dry  mixture.  Bake in a 325F preheated oven for 50-55 minutes.  Let cool  slightly before inverting on a tray.  Let it cool completely before  frosting.    Frosting: Mix cream cheese and cool whip/butter with a mixer until fluffy.  Gradually add the powdered sugar.  Frost the top of the cake and store in  the refrigerator.    *Dont use non-fat cream cheese,  It doesnt hold as well and the frosting  will run.
