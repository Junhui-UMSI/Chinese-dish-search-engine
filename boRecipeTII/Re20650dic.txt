EMERIL LIVE SHOW #EMIA22    In a saute pan, melt the butter. Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon, and  nutmeg. Cook the mixture for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar. Add the  walnuts and apples. Cook the apples for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the apples  are tender and caramelized. Remove the pan from the heat and add the  brandy. Place the pan back on the stove. Shake the pan a couple of times to  ignite the flame. If the flame does not ignite, carefully light the flame  with a match. Spread a scoop of the ice cream evenly over each crepe.  Starting with one side, gently roll the crepe up like a jellyroll. Place  the crepes in the freezer and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Divide the  crepes between four shallow bowls. Spoon the apple/walnut mixture over the  crepes. Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.    Yield: 4 servings    Posted to recipelu-digest by molony <molony@scsn.net> on Feb 22, 1998
