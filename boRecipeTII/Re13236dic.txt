Instructions: Core apples from blossom ends, leaving stem ends intact. Mix  raisins and walnuts and stuff into cavities of cored apples. Set apples,  stems up in a 7x12-inch pan.    In a 1 to 2 quart pan, mix brown sugar, water, butter,cinnamon, and nutmeg;  stir over high heat until mixture boils. Pour hot syrup around apples.  Bake, uncovered, in 350~ oven, basting occasionally with syrup, until  apples are tender when pierced and skin begins to crack, 30 to 35 minutes.    Remove apples from oven; cool in pan at least 10 minutes or let cool to  room temperature.  Set each apple in a small bowl and spoon syrup around  fruit. In the top of each apple, cut a hole large enough for one of the  candy worms and tuck one end into each apple, leaving most of the worm  dangling. Offer cream to pour over apples. Makes 6 ghastly servings.  Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #240    Date: Wed, 09 Oct 1996 15:52:55 -0700    From: Gerald Edgerton <jerrye@wizard.com>
