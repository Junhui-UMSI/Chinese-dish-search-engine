Larrys Tropical Treats
Butter, Brown sugar, Sugar, Egg, Vanilla, + 2 T all-purpose flour, Salt, Baking soda, Candied mango, chopped, Candied pineapple, chopped, Dried apricot, chopped, Chopped Macadamia nuts, White chocolate chunks, Candied papaya, chopped, 
A taste of the tropics in every bite!    Preheat oven to 375=F8.    In a large bowl, cream butter. Gradually add brown and white sugars and  beat until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla.    Sift and stir in flour, salt and baking soda. Fold in candied fruits, nuts  and white chocolate.    Drop batter by teaspoonfuls, well apart, on a greased cookie sheet. Bake  at 375=F8 for about 8-10 minutes. Remove to wire racks and let cool.    Note: If you cant purchase all of the candied fruits, use what you have on  hand-it will still be scrumptious.    Yield: 2 1/2 - 3 dozen. Larry Rosenberg, author of Muffins & Cupcakes  (published by The American Cooking Guild), Fairview, NJ.     Randy Shearer    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest V4 #104 by "Ernest Z.
