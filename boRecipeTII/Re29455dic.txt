Bakewell Raspberry Tart
baked pastry shell, Eggs, Raspberries, Almonds, Butter, Sugar, caster, Distilled rose water, 
Heat the oven to 400 degress. Dice the butter and barely melt it in a small  saucepan over low heat. Away from the heat, add the sugar and then stir in  the ground almonds(which can be ground in the food processor.), the  rosewater and the lightly beaten eggs in that order. Tip the chilled  berries into the pie shell, spreading them evenly, and then pour the almond  mixture over the fruit. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the Bakewell topping  is pale gold and puffed up.    This recipe is from England;the rosewater is not essential. Source: mom
