From Hersheys Chocolate Lovers Cookbook.    This is the easiest recipe I have! Its parev and uses no eggs! No mixer is  needed, just a wooden spoon!    Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, stir together flour, brown  sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add water, banana, oil, vinegar and  vanilla. Stir until smooth. Pour batter into ungreased 8 inch square baking  pan. Bake 35 - 40 minutes or until wooden pick inserted into centre comes  out clean. Serve warm or cool. Makes 9 - 12 servings. (You may sprinkle  with icing sugar when cooled, or even frost the cake, but it really doesnt  need anything!)    Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest by Brenda  Kosky <bkosky@kosky.com> on Aug 10,  1998,
