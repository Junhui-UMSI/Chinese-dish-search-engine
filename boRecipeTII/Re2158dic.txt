Bake  in a 350F oven until toasted golden brown about 25 minutes. Turn cubes over  with a wide spatula occasionally. After 15 minutes, switch pan positions.

Stir often until vegetables are lightly browned,  about 15 minutes. Pour into a large bowl. Add a little broth to pan and    stir to scrape browned bits free. Add to bowl.    Pour 2 cups broth into bowl and add toasted bread, artichoke hearts,  cheese, poultry seasoning, and rosemary; mix well. Add salt and pepper to  taste. Make a well in dressing, add egg, beat with a fork to blend, then  mix egg with dressing.    Spoon into a shallow 3-quart (9- by 13-in) casserole.
