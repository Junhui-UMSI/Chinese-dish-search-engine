West Lake Fish
Soy sauce, Dry sherry or rice wine, Cornstarch, Sugar, Juice of 1 garlic,mashed, Knob ginger, Chekiang vinegar **, Fresh-water bass *, Ginger slices, Lots of water, boiling, 
(sweet-sour Hangchow dish, adapted from Joyce Chens restaurant)    * other fresh-water fish may be substituted; a small striper may be  substituted in a pinch; look for 15-18" (1 1/2 to 2 lb) fish,  preferably one you caught yourself. You could also probably use 2 or        3    bluegills    ** substitute cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, or possibly balsamic    Clean, gut, scale, and rinse fish. Cut through skin three diagonal  cuts on each side like so /// .    Put fish, sherry, and ginger slices into kettle of boiling water.  Water should cover the fish. Cover tightly and immediately turn off  heat. Let stand 15 min.    Meanwhile, mix all the rest of the ingredients and cook over  medium-high heat until sauce thickens. Remove garlic if used. Keep  very hot.    Remove fish carefully from water. Drain and gently pat dry. Pour  boiling sauce over and serve immediately.    Variation: cut sugar to 1 T; cut vinegar to 2 T. Increase soy sauce  to 3 T; add 2 T dry sherry to sauce ingredients; add 2 T chicken  broth to sauce ingredients. This obviously is no longer West Lake  fish but a more standard soy sauce fish.
