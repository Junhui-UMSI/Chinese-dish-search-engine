MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small saucepan with water.  Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until pasty coating separates from  seeds. Press through a sieve or food mill to extract all pulp and soupy  liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps thoroughly, pat dry and marinate fro  1 hour with 1 tablespoon of this tamarind liquid, the oyster sauce and hot  chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile, cut young ginger into toothpick-sized  slivers.  If using mature ginger, peel and sliver. Peel and sliver garlic.  Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes to  develop the flavors.  Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine oyster,  soy and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind liquid.  Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop of water sizzles immediately  into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil. Swirl up sides of wok, and  when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and garlic. Stir fry until  golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding more oil as needed, stir frey shrimp  in batches until orange red, about 3 minutes. Pour sauces over all the  shrimp in the wok and cook at a brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps  are aromatic and sauces have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells,  about 8 minutes. Mix in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning,  sweetening and spiciness.  Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with  rice, enough for 8 with other dishes.
