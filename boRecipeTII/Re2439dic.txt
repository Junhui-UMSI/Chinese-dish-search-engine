Ok this one is in the books. This is by far the best Ive done to date.  These roasts were just plain kickass. I changed the mop alittle which I  will post. We also used the mop as a dipping sauce and it was like eating  candy and I could have doubled the reciepe and they would of still been  hollering for more. If you dont try this then you dont know what your  missin. The hunters must be having fun the damn elk just ran thru my back  yard.    simmer together and let rest for an hour. Mop your meat and then use for  dipping sauce.    Posted to bbq-digest by Don Havranek <phl3426@montana.com> on Oct 25, 1998,
