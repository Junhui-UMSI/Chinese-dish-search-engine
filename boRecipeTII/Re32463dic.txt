Basic Black Beans
Dried black beans, Baking soda, Green pepper, Ground oregano, Water, Sherry wine, Garlic, Ground cumin, Cider vinegar, olive oil, Salt, Onion, 
Rinse beans and discard any stones. In a large pot, soak beans overnight in  water with baking soda, oregano, cumin and green pepper. The next day, add  onion, garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, sherry and salt to the water and  cook on medium-low heat for about 3 hours or until the beans are very  tender and liquid is reduced and somewhat thickened. Make sure liquid in  pot does not entirely boil away. To prevent beans from burning, add more  water when necessary.
