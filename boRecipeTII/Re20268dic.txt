Remove from skillet, add the flour to the pan drippings, enough to form a  smooth paste, & stir until smooth. Pour in the sherry, Marsala, lemon juice  & chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Season with salt & pepper. 4. Strain over  cooked veal. Top each piece of veal with a piece of prosciutto ham & a thin  slice of lemon. Serve.
