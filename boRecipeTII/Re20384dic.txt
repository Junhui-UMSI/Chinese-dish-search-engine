COVER AND REFRIGERATE OVERNIGHT     Preheat oven to 400 Transfer veal to a baking dish and add the marinade.  Cover with foil and place the veal in the oven. Bake 1 hour, covered.  Remove the foil and continue baking, basting occasionally, until the veal  is tender, about 1 more hour    Meanwhile, place the prunes in a saucepan and add the water,brown sugar and  1/4 cup oil. Bring to a boil and simmer,covered 1/2 hour, or until the  prunes are tender. Keep warm. Before the meat is done, heat the remaining  3/4 cup oil in a skillet and add the almonds. Cook, stirring until they are  golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper.    Slice the meat,put on a platter and keep hot. Drain the prunes, arrange on  a platter and scatter the almonds over them.
