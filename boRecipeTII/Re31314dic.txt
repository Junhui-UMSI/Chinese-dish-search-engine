Slice 2 of the onions into 1/4 inch slices. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a frying  pan. Add the sliced onion, and cook, stirring, until the outside has  browned. Remove and drain. Slice the remaining onion into paper-thin slices  and set aside.    Rinse the bones and place in a stockpot. Cover with cold water. Bring  slowly to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered. For a clear broth skim  off foam. After 10 - 15 minutes, add browned onion and ginger, carrots,  cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, cloves, garlic and peppercorns. Bring to a  boil. Simmer the stock, partially covered for 6 to 12 hours, skimming  regularly. If necessary add more water to keep the bones covered. Strain  the stock, skim off, and discard any fat.    At serving time, arrange the sliced beef on a platter. Garnish with  reserved white and green onion. On another platter, arrange the bean  sprouts, coriander, chiles and limes. Meanwhile, plunge the rice sticks in  boiling water to heat. Drain. Place equal portions in each soup bowl. Cover  to keep warm. Heat beef stock to boiling. Season with fish sauce and  pepper. Pour into a soup tureen or chafing dish. At the table, place the  soup on a portable warmer to keep hot. Offer each guest a bowl of warm rice  noodles. Each diner adds some beef and onion to a bowl. Ladle the hot stock  over the meat, stirring to cook the meat. Add the bean sprouts, coriander,  chiles, and lime to taste. Enjoy with chopsticks and a soup spoon.    Optional: pass fresh basil leaves, coriander, additional chilies, fish  sauce and ground peanuts at the table.                         From: kpatrucco@aol.com (KPatrucco)
