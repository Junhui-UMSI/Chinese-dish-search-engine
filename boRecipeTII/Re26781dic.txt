Select firm, medium-sized apples. Wipe & core. Put in a baking dish & fill  each cavity with sugar & cinnamon or nutmeg. (A great flavor is to add 1  teaspoon red-hots candy to each apple.) Cover bottom of dish with boiling  water & bake at 400 until apples are soft, basting often with syrup in  dish. Serve hot or cold with whipped cream. (This dish may be served with  any menu.)
