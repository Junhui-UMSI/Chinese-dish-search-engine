Blanch the almonds in boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain, and plunge  almonds into cold water.  Drain, and squeeze the almonds between your  fingertips to remove the skins. Compost or discard the skins.    Put the blanched almonds and 1 cup of the vegetable stock in a blender, and  blend until smooth, about 1 minute.    In a large pot, combine the potatoes, leeks, and the remaining 4 cups  vegetable stock and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cover and boil  until the potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.    Stir the blanched almond mixture, parsely, lemon juice, salt, and pepper  into the soup.  Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until  thickened, about 2 minutes. Transfer the soup to a food processor and  process, in batches if necessary, until smooth.    Serve immediately.
