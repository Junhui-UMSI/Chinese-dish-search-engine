Chilled Spinach Yogurt Soup
Vegetable oil, Onion, Potato, Salt, Black pepper, To 2 cups vegetable stock, OR water, Spinach, Low fat milk, To 3 teaspoons fresh dill, (chopped), OR 1 teaspoon dried dill, Nutmeg, 
PREPARE VEGETABLES: Wash and stem the spinach.  Peel and chop onion - 1 1/2  cups.  Peel and chop potato.  Chop dill, if it is fresh. Heat oil. Saute  the onions on low heat for about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, salt, dash of  pepper, and stock (or water).  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and  simmer about 10 to 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender. Add the spinach.  When the spinach is wilted but still bright green (2 to 3 minutes), remove  the pan from the heat.  Stir in the milk and dill. Blend in a food  processor or blender, in batches, until the mixture is very smooth. Whisk  in the yogurt. Chill about four hours. The soup will thicken as it chills.  If it is too thick, whisk in some milk, stock, or water. Taste and adjust  the seasoning, if necessary. Serve garnished with a grating of nutmeg.
