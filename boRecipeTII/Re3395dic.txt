Pebre (Chilean Hot Sauce)
Habanero chiles, Red wine vinegar, cilantro , garlic, olive oil, yellow onion, Chopped parsley, Salt, 
"Pebre is a popular Chilean hot sauce traditionally served as a meat or  chicken accompaniment.  Its also delicious atop grilled tomatoes.  A  lovely bright-green color, pebre has a fresh garden taste with none of the  sweet overtones of many hot sauces. Although, this recipe calls for only  two habaneros, they are not masked by a sugar base, and their zesty heat  springs forward alongside the cilantro, parsley and garlic. Warn your  guests that this is no regular steak sauce, but rather an equivalent to the  hot mustard sauce served in Japanese restaurants. A judicious spoonful per  serving is plenty." - Hot Licks    Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree.  To allow flavors to  develop, let the sauce stand at room temperature for several hours before  serving.  Refrigerated, it will keep 1 week.  Makes 2 cups.
