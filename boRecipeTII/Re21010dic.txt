</x-rich><x-rich>(TVP = Texturized Vegetable Protein)    Note: all quantities are approximate, but I tried to write what I used last  time I made it. Can change quantities according to taste. The most involved  part of this recipe is the chopping of the vegetables.    Boil potatoes until tender. Drain and mash with a little butter. Set aside.  (you can add a sweet potato or some parsnips too)    In a large pot, heat oil. Add onions. Cook 2 minutes. Add TVP and season to  taste with salt and pepper, or other herbs. (Soya sauce or tomato paste is  good too. I use italian seasonings -- oregano, basil, marjoram).    Cook 5-7 minutes. Add vegetables and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add tomato  sauce.    Cook for 15 minutes on low to medium heat, until vegetables are tender and  TVP has absorbed some of the sauce.    Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes.    Pour into a greased pie plate or glass dish (8 x8 or 9 x 13 - depending on  how much filling youve made).    Top the mixture with potatoes. Spread evenly. Sprinkle top with grated  parmesan cheese if desired, or chopped herbs and parsley.    Bake for 25 minutes, at 350, or until potatoes are nicely browned.
