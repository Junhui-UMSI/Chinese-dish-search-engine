From: Jeanette Hohls <hohlsj@phsc.unp.ac.za>    Date: Tue, 23 Jul 1996 08:51:10 +0200  To Kathryn, who has become a vegetarian- congratulations and good luck! You  asked for rice casserole dishes that could be reheated.  Here is my  favourite. I adapted it from a book called "Best of Cooking in South  Africa" by Lynn Bedford Hall. My husband and I really enjoy it, it reheats  well and also makes a good filling for toasted sandwiches!    Using a large pot, stir fry leeks, onions, garlic and pepper with a little  water if necessary. When soft, add rice and stir well. Add mushrooms,  brinjals, herbs and tumeric. Toss for a minute or two, then add tomatoes,  beans, peas, parsley, seasoning, sugar, stock and wine. Mix well then turn  into a large 30 cm by 26 cm (12" by 10") baking dish. Cover and bake for 35  minutes at 180 deg C (360 F). Stir lightly with a fork and bake another  20-25 minutes until the veggies are all cooked and the liquid is absorbed.  The mixture should be moist, but not watery! Turn off heat and sprinkle top  with cheese is desired, return to oven for 5-10 minutes to melt cheese.    fatfree digest V96 #202    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.
