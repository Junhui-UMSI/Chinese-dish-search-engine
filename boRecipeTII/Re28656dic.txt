Texas Feta Cheese
Fresh milk, Vinegar, 
Heat 1 gallon of fresh milk to 190 degrees.  Take off the heat and add 1/4  cup vinegar, stirring until curds form.  Drain whey (do not save  vinegar-started whey), bag in a muslin cloth, hang for several hours, or  until the ball is slightly firmed. Cut cheese ball into cubes, sprinkle  canning salt over the cut surfaces, and pack into the jars the jalapeno  peppers came from (see recipe "Pickled Jalapenos #2"). Refrigerate, and use  as needed.     (Soft cheeses will not be good for very long, but using the vinegar  marinade will preserve the cheese.)     A true Feta can be made by adding olive oil to replace 1/2 the liquid in  the jars, but I dont care for it, as it makes the cheese too oily.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
