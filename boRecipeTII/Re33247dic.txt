Basic Potato Dumplings
Egg yolk, Salt, Butter, Potatoes, All-Purpose Flour, Grated Parmesan cheese, Vegetable oil, 
Puncture potatoes in several places with a fork.  Bake 1 hour in a 350F  oven or until tender.  Remove and discard skins. Mash potatoes through a  ricer or food mill into a large bowl, and let cool a little. Add egg yolk,  salt, and 2 cups flour.  Mix well.  Knead dough on work surface or board  into a ball.  It should be soft and a little sticky. If its too sticky,  add a little flour. Lightly flour surface and hands. Break dough into  egg-size pieces.  Roll until thickness of thumb. Cut roll into 1-inch  pieces. Push each Gnocchi against the back of a fork to imprint a pattern.  This helps them absorb more sauce (and makes them a little prettier).  Arrange them on a floured tray. Fill a large saucepan 2/3 full with salted  water.  Bring to a boil.  Add oil and dumplings. Stir, to make sure they  dont stick t bottom. When they come to surface, let them cook 10-12  seconds more.  Remove with a slotted spoon as they are done. They get soggy  if overcooked (they absorb more moisture than regular pasta). Serve with  butter and Parmesan cheese or your favorite sauce.
