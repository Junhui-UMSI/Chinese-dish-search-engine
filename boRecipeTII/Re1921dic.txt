I must be bored silly. Did web searches for cornbread recipes. Of the  around 94 unique recipes found, 82 contained some form of sweetener such as  sugar, honey, molasses in the ingredients and 12 contained no added  sweetener. One very good sounding recipe to go with Q turned up I think Im  gonna try. The recipe says it has been adapted from "Bobby Flays Bold  American Food" Here tis....    These are my cooking directions as the recipe didnt cover this well:    Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees. Heat bacon drippings in skillet until HOT  while you mix all the other ingredients in bowl. When drippings are hot,  pour about 4 tablespoons worth into cornbread mix and stir in. Let skillet  heat a few more minutes until barely smoking then pour mix into skillet and  let cook on burner for a minute. Remove from stove top and place in oven,  baking until top is golden brown with darker brown patches. Test with a  knife or toothpick for doneness. If it pulls out clean, its done.
