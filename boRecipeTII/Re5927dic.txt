Pistachio Couscous
Salt, Packed fresh mint leaves, Fresh Lemon Juice, Boxes; (10-oz) couscous, olive oil, Water, Shelled natural pistachios, 
This recipe was created to accompany Moroccan Lamb and Quince Stew.    Cooking the couscous in 2 pans prevents lumps from forming.    Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.    Preheat oven to 350F.    On a baking sheet in middle of oven toast pistachios in one layer until  golden, about 10 minutes. Once pistachios have cooled, coarsely chop.    In each of two 3-quart saucepans bring 2 1/4 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon  salt to a boil. Stir 1 box couscous into each pan and let stand, covered,  off heat 5 minutes.    Chop mint leaves. Fluff couscous with a fork and transfer to a bowl. Stir  in pistachios, mint, oil, and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.    Serves 8.
