Triple-H Spare Ribs

From: bfrumker@cmnh.org (Bruce Frumker)    Date: Tue, 30 Jul 1996 12:17:49 -0400  I am naming these for Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey, who sure gave  these ribs a fit at the Victory Barbecue at the LBJ Ranch in November 1964.  He went at them like Clyde Beaty to cats and must have eaten them for an  hour, putting away more of them than I have ever seen anybody do. So far as  I could tell, they did him no harm.    Like most good dishes, it is easy to fix.  Buy the ribs "two and under,"  which your butcher will know means slabs of ribs two pounds or less in  weight. Sprinkle them with Dry Rib Seasoning, taking care to get plenty of  seasoning under the flap of meat on the bottom, or bone side, of each slab.  Mop thoroughly and cook on the barbecue grill.    Walter Jetton was BBQ caterer to the LBJ Ranch.  In 1965, he (along with  Arthur Whitman) published "Walter Jettons LBJ Barbecue Cook Book."  I have  mentioned it a couple of times in posts, and, since the book is long out of  print, I got several requests to post some of the recipes.  Here are some  of my favorites, along with Jettons comments and instructions...    bbq-digest V2 #058    From the BBQ recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
