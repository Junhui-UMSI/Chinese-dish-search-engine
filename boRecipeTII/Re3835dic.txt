I dont have an exact recipe for this, but the dough is very much like that  for gingerbread.    Make into a dough, leave for a while (month?) to infuse. Form into chunky  bits. Bake at ? till golden brown. (honey instead of sugar to keep it soft  and chewy instead of crunchy)    The same dough can be used for TAAI-TAAI (tough-tough)    This is usually shaped into little (or bigger) men and women, sometimes the  figure of Sint Nicolaas in his full bishops gear (mitre, staff). Brush  with water and egg before baking.    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #339    From: kmeade@IDS2.IDSONLINE.COM (The Meades)    Date: Thu, 12 Dec 1996 10:55:34 -0500
