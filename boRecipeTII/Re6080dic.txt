Pizza Dough
Active dry yeast, Salt, Olive or vegetable oil, Warm water, All-purpose flour, Sugar, 
Dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Stir in sugar, salt, oil and one and 3/4  cups of the flour.  Turn onto a well-floured board and knead until smooth  and elastic. This should take about five minutes. Knead in enough of the  remaining flour to prevent sticking.    David Andrews
