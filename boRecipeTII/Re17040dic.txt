FOR MEAT: Combine all ingredients in large bowl and use hands to mix gently  but thoroughly. Shape into 12 cylinders approximately 3 inches long and no  more than 1-inch thick. Insert bamboo skewer through each cylinder and set  aside. Arrange garnishes in individual bowls; refrigerate.    FOR SAUCE: Combine all ingredients in small pan and bring to boil. Reduce  heat and simmer 5 minutes. Let cool. Divide among 4 small bowls and set  aside. Heat coals on barbecue until gray ash forms. Spread into overlapping  layer, knocking off ash so coals are hot and glowing. Place grill 2 to 3  inches above coals or, preheat oven to broil. Arrange pork sticks on grill  or broiling pan so they do not touch. Cook until meat is crisped, browned  and firm, turning often with tongs, about 10 to 15 minutes. Have each diner  sprinkle lettuce leaf with other garnishes. Slip pork off skewer onto  lettuce.  Wrap around pork and use sauce for dipping. Meat mixture can be  prepared and skewered up to 24 hours before barbecuing. Sauce will keep 2  weeks in refrigerator.
