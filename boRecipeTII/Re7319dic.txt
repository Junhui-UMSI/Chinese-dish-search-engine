Brush a hot skillet with cooking oil and brown pork chops quickly. Remove  from pan. Saute onion slices in same skillet over medium high heat until  they begin to brown, adding a little more oil, if necessary, to keep them  from sticking. Add sauerkraut to skillet and heat through, stirring. Spread  sauerkraut mixture on bottom of 8" square baking pan. Top with half of  apple slices. Place pork chops on top, season with salt and pepper to  taste, and top with remaining apple slices. Deglaze skillet with wine and  vinegar, stir in brown sugar and pour over pan of pork chops.
