Turkey, 
From: Barbara Pollack <blpatcai@erols.com>    Date: Fri, 12 Jul 1996 11:37:47 -0400 (EDT)  Recipe By: based on recipe from the Frugal Gourmet    Use a completely defrosted turkey.    Put the whole turkey in a pot large.  Add enough water to cover the bird.  Remove the bird and bring the water to a boil.    Cut off the legs and wings and set aside.  Place the carcass in the boiling  water, return the water to boiling, turn down the heat and cover.  Simmer  for       45    minutes.    Add the legs and wings (I like to separate the drumstick and second joint  first), cover, and simmer for another 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and let  stand for 2 hours.  Then remove from liquid or refrigerate the whole thing.  Frug says not to refrigerate in an aluminum pot but stainless steel is  okay. To use: just skin and serve with or without sauces or gravy.
