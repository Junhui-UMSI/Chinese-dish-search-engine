Pulse in  food processor until finely chopped.    2. Whisk flour into milk in bowl. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium  heat; add milk mixture, whisking constantly, and cook, whisking until  mixture thickens and boils. Boil 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in lemon  juice, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Stir in artichokes and cheeses.    3. Place all phyllo sheets in a stack on work surface. With a sharp knife  cut crosswise in seven 2 1/2-inch wide stripes. Cover with plastic. Remove  two stripes and place one on top of the other. Place two level teaspoons of  the artichoke mixture on one end. Fold up around filling (flag-style)  forming into triangles.
