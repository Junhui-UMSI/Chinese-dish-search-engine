The Fat Free Junk Food Cookbook by: J. Kevin Wolfe.    Here is a recipe for FAT FREE (!!) cinnamon rolls (I tried the cinnamon  rolls lat weekend -I made these for myself and a fattening frozen kind  ~Rhodes brand- for my husband and we both agreed these were better!)    Ultra Light Pastry Dough: In a large bowl combine yeast and milk. Stir  gently for 1 minute. (The yeast will not completely dissolve.) Add sugar, 1  1/2 cups of flour, and egg whites. Stir 100 strokes. Let rise for 30  minutes. Then add salt and 1 1/3 cups flour, and stir until well mixed, and  the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough  for five minutes, sprinkling with leftover flour as needed.    Cinnamon rolls: Sprinkle flour on work surface . Place dough on top.  Sprinkle enough flour to keep dough from sticking to the rolling pin. Roll  the dough flat until it is about 1/4 inch thick, in a rectangular shape.  Sprinkle the top with cinnamon-brown sugar mixture. Gently roll dough  rectangle into a log from the long side. Slice into sections 2 inches  thick. Place on non-stick rimmed cookie sheet. Combine egg white and skim  milk for egg wash. Lightly brush tops of rolls with egg wash. Bake in 375  degree oven 20 minutes or until tops are brown. Remove immediately form pan  and ice.    Icing That Moves Like a SLoth: Pour powdered sugar into a small bowl. Boil  milk and pour over sugar. Stir until smooth. Add vanilla and stir until  well blended. Spoon onto cinnamon rolls.
