Makes 8 - 8 inch loaves. Prepare fruits and nuts as desired. Beat eggs in  mixer. Begin creaming the butter. While butter is creaming, add just enough  flour to the fruits and nuts to give each a thin coating so it wont stick  to its neighbor. When the butter is properly creamed, add eggs, sugar,  molasses and soda, spices, remaining flour, vanilla and brandy. Let mixer  go to work on that. Scoop a depression in the top of the fruit-nut pile and  pour the batter over it. Then mix and knead almost like you would knead  bread. Pack into 8 (8") well-buttered foil loaf pans which have been lined  with foil or brown paper and buttered. Place in a 225 degree oven with a  shallow pan of water below them. If the oven temperature is right, they  should be done in 3 to 4 hours. After 1-1/2 hours watch them carefully, and  if the edges begin to crisp before the to cracks in numerous breaks, turn  the heat down and put in a fresh pan of cool water. When little cracks come  across the tops of the cakes they are done. When cool, remove them from the  pans. When cold dab whiskey or brandy liberally over the outside. Wrap each  separately in wax paper, then in aluminum foil. Cover with newspaper and  set away to age in a cool place. This aging takes about a month; the  alcohol will have evaporated by then and have left only the bouquet and  flavor.
