Amish Sugar Pie
Evaporated milk, Cinnamon, pie shell, Salt, Butter, Brown sugar, Flour, 
The following is a Sugar Pie recipe that came from Northern Indiana and is  an old Amish recipe. It is very, very good - and different.    Preheat oven to 350F. In a small bowl blend together the sugar, flour and  salt. Spread in bottom of pie shell. Pour the milk over the sugar mixture,  but do not stir. Dot with the butter and sprinkle cinnamon over all. Bake  for 50-60 minutes, or until filling bubbles in center. This will not be a  firm custard, so dont despair if it doesnt look like the custard pies you  are accustomed to! Pie is best served at room temperature.JM. From Peggy  Makolondra <pmakolon@mail.wiscnet.net>  Posted to recipelu-digest Volume 01 Number 653 by RecipeLu  <recipelu@geocities.com> on Jan 31, 1998
