"In Bangladesh, cabbage is usually available in the market during the  winter season, as are tomatoes, peas and carrots. So this dish appears  quite frequently at Bengali dinner tables during the winter. In the markets  where such vegetables are available year round, banda is a popular  standard." Meghna Guharthakurta, Dhaka, Bangladesh    Start by heating the oil in a heavy pan and put in the tumeric and some  salt. Fry for a few seconds and then add the cubed potatoes, turning  frequently so that they turn yellow from the tumeric. Cook them for 5-10  minutes (they will complete their cooking later) and remove them from the  oil and set aside. Adding more oil if necessary, now saute the onion slices  until they are soft and transparent. Then add the bay leaf, cumin, ginger  and chili powder. Stir well and put in the tomatoes. When they have begun  to break down, add the cabbage bit by bit, stirring it in well so that it  is sauteed in the spices. Cover and cook gently for 3-5 minutes. Finally  put in the peas and semi-fried potatoes and seasoning.Mix well, replace the  cover and continue to cook for 5-10 minutes or until potatoes are ready.
