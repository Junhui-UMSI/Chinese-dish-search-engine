Clarified Butter (Ghee)
FLATBREADS & FLAVORS; ALFORD, Butter; unsalted, 
Melt butter in heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat.  Once melted,  continue cooking, without letting it boil, for about 30 minutes.    The moisture in the butter will crackle as it evaporates.  White foam will  form on the surface, and the milk solids will sink to the bottom of the  pan.  When these solids start to turn brown, pour off clear clarified  butter into clean jug.  Then pour through several layers of cheesecloth  into sterilized glass jar.  Cheesecloth will filter out any impurities,  leaving clear pale yellow liquid.  Let cool completely, then seal well.  When cooled, ghee thickens into a soft yellow paste. It will keep for  months.    Authors comments: Clarified butter is sold in South Asian stores, but you  can easily make a supply for yourself.  Clarifying removes the milk solids,  which can go bad over time, leaving only the butterfat. Ghee adds a  distinctive and enticing flavor to foods and keeps well, as long as it is  stored in a cool spot in a clean, well-sealed container.    Sylvias comments: I apparently didnt watch closely enough, my ghee turned  a golden brown when I wasnt looking.  I filtered it through a thin brown  coffee filter rather than cheesecloth (which I didnt have). It took  forever to filter and I had to zap it in the microwave to heat it a little  to finish filtering.  It smells a little "toasted" but works fine.
