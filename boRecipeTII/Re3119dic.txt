Add stock and peanut  butter; simmer 20 minutes. Allow mixture to cool 15 minutes, then puree in  batches in blender. (The soup may be made ahead to this point and  refrigerated.) To serve, reheat in saucepan over medium heat. Correct  seasoning with salt and lemon juice. Serve with a dash of cream and a  sprinkling of peanuts.
