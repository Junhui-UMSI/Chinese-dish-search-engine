Heat olive oil in a  large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. When it is hot, add the garlic,  paprika, and cayenne to taste, stir. Stir in the rosemary and thyme, and  then sprinkle in the parsley. Add the potatoes to the skillet, turn once to  coat, and season generously with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet,  transfer it to the oven and bake until the potatoes begin to soften, 15  minutes.  Uncover, stir and continue cooking until the potatoes are golden  brown and tender, 25-35 minutes; turn them occasionally so they brown  evenly.  remove from the oven and serve immediately. 4-6 servings.
