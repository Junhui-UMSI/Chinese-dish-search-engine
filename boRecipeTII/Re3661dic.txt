1. Score chestnuts by making a crisscross cut on the flat side of each one.    2. Bring water to a boil. Add chestnuts and cook until soft (about 40  minutes). Drain, let cool and shell.    3. Mince or grind chestnut meats; then blend in sugar and salt. Shape the  mixture as a mound on a serving platter.    4. Whip cream. Then fold in powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Arrange as  a topping over chestnut mound.    5. Serve garnished with either preserved kumquats or maraschino cherries;  or with "Glazed Fruit for Peking Dust", which must be prepared in advance  (see recipe). VARIATION: In step 4, fold half the sweetened whipped cream  into the chestnut mixture. Pack the mixture into an oiled mold or bowl;  then carefully invert onto a serving platter. Top with remaining whipped  cream, and garnish as in step 5.    From <The Thousand Recipe Chinese Cookbook>, ISBN 0-517-65870-4. Downloaded  from G Internet, G Internet.
