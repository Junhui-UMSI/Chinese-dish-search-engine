Peanut Sauce
Peanut oil, Dark soy sauce, Sugar, Raw peanuts, Garlic, Minced cilantro leaves, Fish sauce, Fresh jalapeno peppers, Fresh lime juice, Unsweetened coconut milk, Salt, Fresh ginger, 
Heat the peanut oil to nearly smoking in a saucepan. Turn off the heat and  add the peanuts. The peanuts should cook to a golden brown in 3-5 minutes.  If you burn them, throw them out and start all over again or your sauce  will be bitter. You may have to turn on the heat again, but stir the  peanuts if you do. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peanuts to the  container of a food processor or blender, along with 1 T of the peanut oil  (reserve the rest) and blend them to a rough paste. Add the chiles, ginger,  garlic and continue to blend. Add the remaining ingredients except the  cilantro, and blend until smooth. If it is too thick, add more oil. Stir in  cilantro, and serve with satay.
