Cut in the  shortening or work it in with the hands, until the dough is manageable.  Moisten with cold water. Roll, not too thin, using rolled oats on the board  to prevent the dough from sticking. Cut into desired shapes, or use a knife  and cut into diamonds or squares. Bake in a 350 oven for 15 minutes. 6-7  dozen.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /COOKIES    From rec.food.cooking archives.
