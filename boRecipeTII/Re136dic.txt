Kokosh Cake
Warm water, Sugar, Fresh yeast; (not dry ), Orange juice, Flour, Sugar, Salt, Eggs, Vegetable oil, Rind of 1 lemon, 
Directions: Exactly the same as it is written, but you have to change the filling. If you do not want the cocoa, you use the same filling that I have in the Archive , but omit the cocoa. Use butter (or margarine with butter taste), add vanilla essence, 1-2 Tabls cinnamon + 3/4 cup sugar. I hope you will get it right. I am going to try this recipe myself, and maybe I'll try and make from this recipe Baked Sufganiot. Good luck for all of us.
