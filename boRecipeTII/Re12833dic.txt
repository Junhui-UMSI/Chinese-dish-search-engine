Yummy Yogurt Popcorn
Popped popcorn, Brown sugar, Light corn syrup, Plain yogurt, 
I just found a great site for popcorn recipes if anyone else is interested:  http://www.popcorn.org/rcindex.htm    Put popped popcorn in a large bowl and keep warm. In a 2 1/2-quart  saucepan, combine yogurt, brown sugar and corn syrup.    Cook and stir over medium heat to hard ball stage (250 degrees Fahrenheit  on candy thermometer). Pour over popped popcorn, stirring to coat.    Yield: 2 1/2 quarts.
