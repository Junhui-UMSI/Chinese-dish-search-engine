Potato Asparagus Soup with Spring Onions
Wax potatoes, spring onions, Vegetable stock, chives, fresh thyme, Dry white wine, Salt and pepper to taste, Asparagus, 
Put all except cives into a pot and simmer until potatoes are tender.  Garnish with chives before serveing. Its that easy! This could probably be  made a crock pot too. Since I dont like to waste any form of food I save  the ends cut off the asparagus and peel them with a vegetable peeler. My  motto: Waste not want not!
