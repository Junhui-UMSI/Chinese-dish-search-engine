Season inside and out with salt and pepper. In a mixing bowl combine next  10 ingredients. Mix thoroughly. Divide stuffing among drumsticks, stuffing  each drumstick evenly under skin. Place in a roasting pan, skin side up.  Roast for 30 minutes, basting once after 15 minutes with softened butter,  or until skin is golden brown and puffy. Remove drumsticks to a warm  platter, cover and keep warm while preparing sauce.    Place roasting pan over high heat. Add stock and deglaze, scraping up  browned bits and incorporating them into sauce. Boil until half of liquid  evaporates. Whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until incorporated and  sauce is lightly thickened.    Serve turkey on warm dinner plates, surrounded with sauce and sprinkled  with parsley.
