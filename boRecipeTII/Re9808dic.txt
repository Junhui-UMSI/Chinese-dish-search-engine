Hello Betsy.  Im going to post a recipe I havent tried but saw in the  Oct/Nov 95 issue of "Taste of Home"  It sounds as though you already know  what stew recipe youre going to use, but I thought the procedure for  serving it in a Pumpkin might be helpful.  Good luck on your first party  (which happens to be on my husbands birthday!)  Lilia    In a Dutch oven, brown meat in 2 TB oil.  Add water, potatoes, carrots,  green pepper, garlic, onion, salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer for 2  hours.  Stir in bouillon and tomatoes.    Wash pumpkin; cut a 6 to 8 inch circle around top stem.  Remove top and set  aside; discard seeds and loose fibers from inside.  Place pumpkin in a  shallow sturdy baking pan.  Spoon stew into pumpkin and replace the top.  Brush outside of pumpkin with remaining oil.  Bake at 325 for 2 hours or  just until the pumpkin is tender (do not overbake).  Serve stew from  pumpkin, scooping out a little pumpkin with each serving.  Yield:  8 - 10  servings.
