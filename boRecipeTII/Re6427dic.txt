Plum Pot Pies
Red or black plums; pitted, Vanilla ice cream; or, Cornstarch, Unsalted butter; melted, Plus 3/4 teaspoon ground, Cinnamon, Quick-cooking tapioca, Biscuit dough (previous, GARNISH, Plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together 3/4 cup of the  sugar, the cornstarch, tapioca, 1/4 teaspoon of the ginger and the  cinnamon. Add the plum slices and toss gently to coat. Lightly butter the  inside rim of six 1 1/2-cup ovenproof ramekins or baking cups. In a small  bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and 3/4 teaspoon ginger. On  a floured surface, roll out the Biscuit Dough 1/8-inch thick, lightly  flouring the dough if necessary. Using a round cutter that is 1/2-inch  larger than the ramekins, cut out 6 rounds. Cut small decorative shapes  from the dough scraps for appliques if desired.    Stir the plums and spoon them and their juice evenly into the ramekins;  they should be about three quarters full. Place a round of dough over each  ramekin, tucking the excess inside the rim. Press the dough gently to  adhere to the rim. Brush the top of the dough with the melted butter.    If using , affix the appliques on the top and brush them with butter.  Sprinkle the top of each pie with about 1 teaspoon of the ginger-sugar.  Using the tip of a sharp knife, slice a few vents in the dough. Place the  ramekins on a baking sheet, making sure they dont touch one another. Bake  for 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 15  minutes longer, or until the tops are nicely browned and the filling is  bubbling. Transfer the ramekins to a rack to cool for 30 minutes. Serve  warm with ice cream or whipped cream.
