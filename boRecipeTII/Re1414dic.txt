Emerils Jalepeno Biscuits
All purpose flour, Baking Powder, Baking soda, Salt, Cold unsalted butter, jalepenos, buttermilk, 
Preheat oven to 375~. Line a baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Sift  dry ingredients into a bowl. Cut in butter with a fork or fingers until  mixture is crumbly. Stir in pepper to taste. Add just enough buttemilk, a  little at a time, for mixture to come together into a smooth ball of dough.  Do not overwork dough. On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into a 7  inch round, 1/2 inch thick. Using a 1 inch cookie cutter press out 12  rounds. Reroll any scraps to make additional biscuits, but these will not  be as tender. Transfer rounds to baking sheet and bake 15 mins or until  tops are golden brown. Serve warm.
