NOTES:  Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been made,        this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand. Use it in        Thai curries unless otherwise specified.  A little added to stir-fry        dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or        grilling will add a real Thai accent.  A teaspoon added to a meatloaf        mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is rather        exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk, it        makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays.          Use whole spices whenever possible.  Anchovy fillets may be        substituted for the anchovy paste.  Shallots are preferable to  onions;        if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.    Recipe:  Chuck Ozburn in Pok, New York
