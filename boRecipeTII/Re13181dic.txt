Woodruff Special
Oregano, salt and pepper, Rice, cooked, Sauerkraut (large can, well, Spaghetti sauce, Chopped beef, Cabbage leaves (1/4 head), Onion, Slices bacon, Drained), Garlic salt to taste, 
DIRECTIONS Fry the bacon fairly crisp and reserve it. Use the bacon fat to  grease a pan or casserole (a 10" x 12" x 2" pan is just about right for  this recipe). Tear cabbage leaves as necessary to line the bottom of the  pan, about 2-3 leaves thick. Break up the chopped beef and crumble on top  of the cabbage leaves. Crumble the bacon pieces on top of the beef. Add the  chopped onion, and then add salt, pepper, garlic salt and oregano. Cover  this with the cooked rice and then the sauerkraut. Cover with another layer  of cabbage leaves, about 2-3 leaves thick. Finally, pour the spaghetti  sauce on top, distributing it evenly.   Bake, covered at 325 degrees for 3-4 hours.
