SERVES 6      Have you thought about garlic with apples? Well, the two belong together,  absolutely belong together. This is a quick dish that is not terribly  sweet, as you would expect, but very flavorful.      Cut the pork steak as instructed and marinate for 15 minutes in the soy,  sherry, and ginger. Heat a wok or large frying pan and add the oil and  garlic. Drain the marinade from the meat and saute the meat over very high  heat until done to your liking, about 6 minutes. Remove the meat from the  pan and add the onion slices. saute until tender and then add the apple  slices. saute just until they begin to brown. Return the meat to the pan,  add the sesame oil and pepper, and toss. Top with the green onions as a  garnish. Serve immediately.      This is a whole meal if you simply add Macaroni Pie (see recipe) and a  green salad.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
