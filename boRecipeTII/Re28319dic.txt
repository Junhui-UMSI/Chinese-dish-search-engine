Source: From my Mother with Love & More. Rina.    You will need a rectangle dish that hold 6 halibut steaks.    In a bowl put cabbage ,Half the amount of lemon juice, 1/8 teasp salt, some  freshly ground pepper , less the 1/8 teasp granulate garlic, and 2 tables  of olive oil. With clean hand mix the cabbage, and squeeze a little the  cabbage to soften. Arrange in the rectangle dish as first layer.    On top put the frozen Halibut.    See Note: To prepare Parsely.I take the bunch in one hand very near the  leaves, and pull down the stalks, with the other hand I twist the stalks  till they torn,Wash leaves in bowl with plenty of water and dry them with  paper towel.    In your Food Processor use still knife, put Parsley and use - on / off  button 2 -3 times, Add all other ingredients - not Granulated garlic but  the fresh mashed one, Add another 1/2 teasp salt and some ground fresh  pepper. Work Food Processor again on/off button, till all blend nice.    Arrange over the halibut and spread evenly on top.    Cover with aluminium foil and Bake in pre heated 375 F hot oven for 20  minutes.<<< Take off Cover and continue to bake for another 20 -25 minutes.  or till you get nice color on top, and your folk will come easy out of  fish.    <<< At this stage ,if you get some guests, you can prepare the fish an hour  before they arrives, and continue the second stage 25- 30 minutes before  you serve the dish, Uncover and continue as written above.
