Beat eggs with salt, sugar, and melted butter. Mix in  farfel.    In greased 1-1/2 qt. baking dish, place 1/2 of farfel mixture.  Arrange  bananas on top, and sprinkle with nuts. Top with the rest of the farfel  mixture    Bake at 350 for 45 min. or until set, and lightly browned. I havent tried  this one, but it looked interesting.
