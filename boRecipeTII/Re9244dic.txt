Anyway, one guys mother had the most  awesome mashed potato recipe. She gladly shared her recipe with her son and  he shared it with all of us. This roommates name was Puda, nicknamed  after his last name which was Porter. Even though I havent seen Puda in  many years, those potatoes will always be known as "Puda Potatoes!!!" even  to members of our family that never met him. Now that Ive bored you to  death, heres the world famous mashed potato recipe:    Peel potatoes and cook them in a pan covered with water.  (Just as you  would for mashed potatoes). Drain. Mash potatoes with cream cheese, sour  cream, and garlic salt. When well mixed and mashed, add the chives and mix.  Place mashed potato mixture in buttered casserole dish. Bake uncovered at  350F for 1 hour. Enjoy!!!    EAT-L DIGEST 23 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
