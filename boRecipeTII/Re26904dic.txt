Arrange in butter baking pan and dot with 1/4 c. butterx.  Bake       15    minutes, uncovered.    Meanwhile, melt 2 T. butter in a saucepan and add flour; cook for a minute  or two.  Stir in bouillon (made from cubes, or use canned for less salt)  and wine. Cook and stir until thickened and smooth. Add parsley. Add  mushrooms, if desired. Pour sauce over chicken; cover pan tightly. Bake  10-15 minutes longer, until chicken is done.    Makes 4 servings, and goes well with wild rice or a rice pilaf.  Looks and  tastes like more trouble than it is!    *I use about half that amount and it works just as well.    EAT-L DIGEST 17 JUNE 1996    From the EAT-L recipe list.
