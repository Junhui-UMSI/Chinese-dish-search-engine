It contains mostly  celebrity recipes that were prepared on the Mike Douglas talk show.  I  believe this one came from Mikes mother-in-law and it is great.    Saute onion in 1 Tb. butter until transparent.  Set aside.  Combine milk  and egg. Add cracker crumbs and seasonings - set aside until crumbs absorb  liquid.  Add meat and onions.  Mix gently but well.  Shape into l inch  balls. Saute in 1/3 Cup butter until well browned, turning as necessary.  Remove meatballs from pan and discard drippings. In same pan melt 1/4 Cup  butter. Add flour, stirring constantly - cook over low heat a few minutes.  Add remaining ingredients, cook and stir until thickened. Add meatballs and  simmer 10 minutes, turning several times.  Serve with buttered egg noodles.  Serves 8.    EAT-L Digest 16 August 96    From the EAT-L recipe list.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
