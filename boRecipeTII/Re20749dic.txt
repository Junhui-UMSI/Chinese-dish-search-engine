Apple Duff
Cinnamon to taste, Raisins, Dessert apples, Cream, whipped, Brown sugar, Beaten egg, Puff pastry (12 oz), 
(Inspired by James Joyces "Ulysses")    Preheat the oven to 400F. Peel and core the apples. Stuff the centers  with a mixture of brown sugar, raisins and cinnamon. Roll out the  pastry and cut out 4 circles approximately 8" in diameter, depending  on the size of the apples. Place an apple in the center of the pastry  circle and brush the edge with beaten egg; draw up the pastry to  enfold the apple, pressing the edges firmly to seal. Brush the tops  of the pastry parcels with the remaining egg to glaze. Bake in a  shallow ovenproof dish for 40 minutes. Serve with whipped cream.
