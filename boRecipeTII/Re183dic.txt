Pecans Halves, Granulated sugar, All-purpose flour, Baking Powder, Salt, Egg, Butter or Margarine, Vanilla extract, 
As we prepare to move on to our All-Irish Cooking month of March, The Cook & Kitchen Staff are offering you some of the best recipes sent from our Members in February. Todays offering is from an unknown AOL member that  knows a great cookie recipe when they see one and has shared this fantastic little recipe with us today.  Thank you to all members that took the time to send in a recipe.  We're just sorry we wont have an opportunity to publish them all!   Grind the pecans and sugar in a food processor and place in a large mixing bowl.   Add flour, baking powder and salt.   In a separate bowl, beat egg thoroughly and add melted butter and vanilla.   Stir into the flour mixture.    Drop by teaspoonfuls about 3-inches apart onto lightly greased foil-lined baking sheets.  Place a pecan half in the center of each cookie.  Bake in a pre-heated oven at 325-F degrees for 8 to 10-minutes or until golden brown and lacy.  Allow cookies to cool completely before carefully removing from  foil.   Store in an airtight container.
