From: viv@higgs.ph.unimelb.edu.au (Viviane Buzzi)    Date: 9 Feb 1994 20:59:18 -0500  I got this recipe for a healthy but luscious Pritiken style fruit cake from  a cooking program here in Australia, run by a French chef called Gabriel  Gate`.  It is a very luscious and moist cake and is beautiful eaten for  breakfast or for dessert with icecream or cream...or yogurt.  I highly  recommend it...even to those who refuse to eat anything that sounds so  healthy!!    Place dried fruit into a saucepan, cover with cold water.  Bring to the  boil, covered, and let simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and  allow to cool. Put liquid from fruit into a blender with 10 apricots from  the pan and the banana. Puree` and transfer to a bowl. Add the orange zest  and cinnamon. Sift the flour with the baking powder. Stir in the flour and  almond meal to the liquid mixture until the batter is smooth.  Fold in the  dried fruit.  Place in a greased loaf tin and smooth the top flat.  Place  into a preheated 180C/350F oven and bake for about 40 minutes. Let cool in  tin for 5 minutes. Invert and serve cold.    NB: If you wish you could even add 1 tblsp of rum or marsala to the liquid  mixture....marsala is especially lovely with this cake.
