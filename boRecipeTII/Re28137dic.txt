Baked Creamed Corn
Butter, Salt and pepper to taste, Ears fresh corn, 
SERVES 4      I had never tasted this dish, nor had I ever even heard of it, until one  of my staff in Chicago, Mark Blank, told me about his summer days on his  grandfathers farm in Indiana. This was one of his favorite dishes and he  even brought me the device that his grandfather had made for this special  dish. You need a corn scraper in order to do this properly, and it can be  done only with fresh corn. I just bought an "original" Lees corn cutter and  creamer and it seems to work quite well.      When Mark was sitting in a corner of the studio scraping, he said, "You  know, this wont taste right. You have to have bees flying about your head  while you scrape corn in the lndiana sun. We have no bees!" The dish is  quite delicious, nevertheless. You will think that there is actually cream  in this dish, but there is none.      Scrape the corn from the cob and cream it, using a corn cutter/creamer.  Place the mixture in a greased baking dish and pour the melted butter on  top. Bake uncovered at 375? for about 30 minutes, or until the top lightly  browns.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
