Polenta Taragna Alla Valtellinese
Polenta Taragna, Unsalted butter, cut into, Tallegio cheese, sliced, Salt, Freshly ground black pepper,, Water, 
Bring the water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Reduce the heat to  moderately low so that the water comes to a simmer.    Begin pouring in the polenta taragna by the handful, in a thin stream, very  slowly, and stir constantly with a long handled wooden spoon to avoid  lumps. Keep the mixture at a bare simmer and stir fre quently. (It is not  necessary to stir constantly if the polenta is cooked on low heat.) After  all the polenta is added, stir in 3 tablespoons of the butter and cook the  polenta for 20 to 25 minutes. As it cooks, the polenta will thicken  considerable; just keep stirring, and crush against the side of the pan any  lumps that might form. The polenta is done when it comes away effortlessly  from the s ides of the pan.    Remove the pan from the heat and stir in half of the cheese, the remaining  3 tablespoons butter, and pepper. Season to taste. Add remaining cheese and  stir quickly, leaving some of the cheese unmelte d. Transfer the polenta to  a serving platter and serve immediately.
