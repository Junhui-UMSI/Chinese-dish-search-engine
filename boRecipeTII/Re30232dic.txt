Add  to dry ingredients and mix just until dry ingredients are moistened.  Spoon  into lightly buttered and floured 9" square pan and bake in moderate over  (350 F) 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand 5 min. Loosen edges  with spatula and turn out onto cake ralk. Covered with waxed paper. Cool to  room temperature before cutting in squares. Note: this is a very moist,  spongy bread that stays fresh several days if stored airtight.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
