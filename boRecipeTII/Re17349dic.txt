Recipe by: St. Louis Post-Dispatch 8/14/95 To prepare cake: Rub butter  generously on bottom and sides of a Bundt cake pan. Add flour and turn to  coat all surfaces. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Combine apples with 2 cups  water and lemon juice. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, sift together  granulated and brown sugars, 3 cups sifted flour, baking soda, salt,  cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Add vanilla, oil and eggs; mix well. Spoon  soaked apples into batter, so that some of the soaking liquid is included  for moistness. Fold in nuts. Bake on low oven rack for 1 hour, 15 minutes  or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool cake in  pan 10 minutes, then turn out onto cake rack. When cake has cooled, prepare  glaze: In a small saucepan with heavy bottom, combine butter, granulated  sugar, brown sugar and cream. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,  until slightly thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat; let cool  5 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Pour glaze over cake. Garnish as desired with  nut halves. Yield: 12 to 16 servings. Recipe from: Dotty Griffith, who  writes for The Dallas Morning News.
