1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 1-1/2 quart casserole baking  dish. 2. Prepare apples, using only tart ones such as Granny Smith. Place  the apples in baking dish. Drizzle the molasses over and then sprinkle the  spices over that. 3. Bake until apples are soft. Time varies depending on  what kind of apples you use. Pierce with a sharp knife to test when soft,  then pour the topping over apples and bake for 25 minutes longer or until  top is brown and crusty. (Turn oven to 375 to bake topping.)    TOPPING: Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Mix  together the egg which has been well beaten, milk and melted margarine.  Stir gently into the flour mixture. Pour over cooked apples, bake until  crusty and browned. Serve warm with a vanilla sauce, or orange sauce.
