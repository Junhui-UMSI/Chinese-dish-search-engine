Bacon Cheddar Dip
Buttermilk, Onion flakes, Salad dressing, Bacon bits, Garlic salt, medium Cheddar cheese, 
Mix all 6 ingredients in bowl.  Cover.  Chill for 30 minutes.  Serve with  raw vegetables and assorted crackers.  Makes 2 1/3 cups (575ml) dip.    * You can use the artificial bacon bits (ick!) or for a more rewarding dip,  though it is more time consuming, make your own bits with real bacon.
