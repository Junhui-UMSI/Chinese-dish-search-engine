COOKING LIVE SHOW #CL8965    All recipes courtesy of Michel Stroot, The Golden Door Cookbook    In a wide heavy saucepan or skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Saute  the onion, garlic, and ginger for 2 to 3 minutes, until the onion is  translucent. Arrange the fish, clams, and shrimp separately over the onion  and add the broth, the sake, if desired, tamari, and salt. Bring to a  simmer and skim off the fat.    Lay the cabbage leaves on a work surface and roll into tight cylinders.  Arrange the cabbage rolls, carrot, spinach, and mushrooms separately over  the seafood and simmer for 5 minutes longer, or until the vegetables are  crisp-tender. Remove from the heat.    Add the tofu and let it sit in the hot broth until heated through. Sprinkle  with the scallions and serve in shallow bowls, garnished with the lime  quarters.
