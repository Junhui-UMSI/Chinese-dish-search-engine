Bar-B-Que Sauce
Cornstarch, Onion, Mustard, Water, Vinegar, Worcestershire Sauce, Catsup, Garlic, Molasses, Vegetable oil, 
1. Heat oil in pan. Dice onion, add to pan. Brown onions over high heat,  add garlic, if desired. Stir as needed, so the onion doesnt burn. When  onion turns clear, add the following and quickly stir in vinegar,  Worcestershire sauce, molasses and mustard. When these have mulled  together, stir in catsup and cold water with cornstarch stirred in.   2. Simmer sauce over low heat, for at least ten minutes. Take care it  doesnt burn. More water can be added, to thin, or to make more sauce. The  corn starch will thicken the sauce as it simmers.   3. This sauce can be used as a marinade for beef, pork or chicken. Remove  meat from sauce to BBQ, or bake in sauce in oven at 350F. Usually marinade  enough chicken for 6-8 people in half of this recipe and freeze the other  half of the sauce, for another time.
