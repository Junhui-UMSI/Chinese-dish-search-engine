* Note: Italian plums are in season in the fall. Other plums-or another  fruit-may be substituted, but may not be as sweet. Sugar them to taste. 1.  Sift flour into a bowl and make a well in the center. Place yeast and 1  tablespoon sugar in the well. Add the milk and stir to dissolve the yeast  mixture. Cover the bowl and set aside for 20 minutes. 2. Add the melted  butter, egg, salt, lemon and orange zests and remaining sugar. Stir the  mixture to make a soft dough. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface  and knead until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased bowl and  cover. Let rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 3. Punch down  dough and roll or pat it to fit a greased, 15-by-12-inch jellyroll pan. Cut  the plums in half and place them on top of the dough in rows, overlapping  the fruit if necessary. 4. Prepare the topping by combining the flour,  sugars and spices in a bowl. Add the butter and stir until the mixture  resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle topping evenly over the plums. Set aside  to rise for 30 minutes. 5. Heat an oven to 375 degrees. Place jellyroll pan  in the center of the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until plums are  soft.
