Truffle Stuffed Chicken Legs W Candied Butternut Squash
Garlic, Cinnamon, Sugar, Butternut squash, Black truffle, Egg, onions, Basic pie dough, Nutmeg, Salt, Butter, Black Pepper, Boned chicken legs, Olive oil, Fresh lemons, 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.    Bring a pot of boiling water to a boil. Add the squash and season with 1  teaspoon of salt. Cook until the squash is tender, about 7 minutes. Remove  from the heat and drain. In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the  butter. Add the squash, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Season with salt and  pepper. Saute for 2 minutes and remove from the heat. Keep the squash warm.    Season the chicken legs all over with a drizzle of olive oil and salt and  pepper. In a small mixing bowl, toss the lemon zest, garlic and onions with  olive oil, salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity of each chicken leg with the  lemon and onion mixture. Divide the truffle slices into fourths and stuff  the truffle slices underneath the skin of each chicken leg.    Brush the half-circles of dough with some of the beaten egg and place one  leg on each piece with the joint sticking out. Fold the ends over to create  a wrapper and place, seam-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Brush the outside of each package with more of the beaten egg and bake  until the crust is brown and the chicken tender, about 35 minutes. Serve  the candied squash with the chicken legs.
