Venison Shish Ka Bob
Garlic powder, Cayenne pepper, onion, Venison, green pepper, Ground ginger, Soy sauce, SHISH KA BOB, Sugar, jalapeno chile pepper, Dry mustard, MARINADE, Cooking oil, 
Marinate meat for at least 4 hours.    Alternately place vegtables and meat on Ka-Bob skewers. Marinate in sauce  above.    Cook on open grill over hot coals turning often until done.  Note: Make  sure to have enough!    I sometimes add slices of jalapenos for a extra kick...  Posted to bbq-digest V2 #88    Date: Tue, 8 Oct 1996 12:01:55 0000    From: Steve <recipes@erols.com>
