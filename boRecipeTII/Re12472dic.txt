Zvias Afghan Spice Rub
Cumin seed, Ground cardamom, Black peppercorns, Tumeric, Ground coriander, 
Grind all ingredients together with a mortar and pestle or spice grinder.  Store in an airtight container. Make 1/3 cup.    NOTES : Can be rubbed into beef, pork or chicken two hours before grilling.  It also adds a pungent note to tuna, swordfish, bluefish or bass if rubbed  onto both sides of the steaks or fillets about an hour before grilling.  In  either case, the rub can be left on the meat orfish while grilling to make  a blackened, seasoned crust. Used as a spice, it can be stirred into boiled  rice or summer soupws to taste.
