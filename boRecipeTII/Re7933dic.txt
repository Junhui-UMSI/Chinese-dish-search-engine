Maria: Here is my favorite - never fail way - makes a great gravy. Its  from Betty Crocker and I have it memorized...Leanda    Mix soup and soup mix. Place large piece of foil in baking pan. Place beef  on top of foil. Spread soup mix over beef. Add the vegetables around the  beef. Sprinkle water over all of it. Fold foil over and seal well. Cook in  300 degree oven for about 4 hours (adjust roasting time according to size  of roast). Serve gravy with beef. NOTE: This works good on a grill too.
