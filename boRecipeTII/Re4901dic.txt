Pickled Eggs #1
Eggs, Yellow onion, pickled beets, 
I fondly remember my mother making these a couple of times when I was a  child. I had forgotten about the dish until I was visiting my Pennsylvania  Dutch friends, the Mitmans. Mrs. Mitman served pickled eggs for lunch and I  was delighted. This is a great dish for a summer-evening snack, but Ill  eat them in the winter and enjoy them just as much.      This dish presents another lesson in Pennsylvania Dutch eating. There is  an old custom requiring "seven sweets and seven sours." It is typical of  their belief that things are to be balanced and proper. All sorts of  pickles qualify for the 7-7 rule, and this egg dish is a fine "sour."      Hard-boil and peel the eggs. Put them in a covered container along with 1  sliced yellow onion and a jar of pickled beets, juice and all, and  refrigerate. Let them sit for 2 days and serve.
