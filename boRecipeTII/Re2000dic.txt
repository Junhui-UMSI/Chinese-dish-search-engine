"Dogs Nose Salsa" - Xni Pec
Habanero chilies (or scotch, Ripe tomato; cut in 1/4 in, White onion; finely chopped, Orange juice, Fresh lime juice PLUS, Fresh orange juice, Salt, 
Combine the chilies, tomato, onion, cilantro, 3 tablespoons sour orange  juice, and salt in a serving bowl. Toss to mix. Correct the seasoning,  adding more sour orange juice if necessary. The salsa tastes best served  within 3 hours of making.    Makes about 1 cup; enough to serve 4 to 6.    Note: You can blunt the salsa bite a little by seeding the chilies. Of  course, youll lose a great measure of authenticity.    Formatted by JoAnn Pellegrino 9/98 NOTES  : The worlds most colorfully named salsa-xni pec (pronounced "shnee pek")  ~ is also one of the worlds hottest. Xni is the Mayan word for "dog", pec  for "nose". Just why its thus named is a matter of debate. The most likely  explanation is that the chilies make your nose run, an effect I can readily  attest to. And a dogs nose is always wet. Ive given a range of chilies-a  person from the Yucatan would use the full eight. There is more to this  fighter than heat alone. The onion, tomato, cilantro, and sour orange  create a complex play of flavors.    Recipe by: Barbecue! The Bible/S.
