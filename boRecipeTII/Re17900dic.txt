To make pastry:    Sift flour and salt into large bowl.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles  bread crumbs.  With a fork, lightly mix in sugar, egg yolk and enough ice  water to make a dough.  Press into a ball and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate       30    minutes.    On a floured surface, roll out dough to fit a 9-inch springform pan,  including sides.  Place dough in pan without stretching.  Pierce bottom  with fork.  Preheat oven to 400.    To make filling:    Peel, quarter, and core apples.  Thinly slice each quarter several times  without cutting all the way through.  Sprinkle with lemon juice.  Arrange  apples in pastry shell.  In a medium bowl, beat eggs and sugar until pale  and creamy.  Add cream and vanilla.  Pour egg mixture over apples.  Bake 20  minutes, then reduce heat to 350 and bake 25 minutes longer or until  custard filling is firm.
