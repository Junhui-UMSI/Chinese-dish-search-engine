Arugula, Pine Nut and Parmesan Salad
Black Pepper, Preheat the oven to 350F, Pine nuts, Parmigiano-reggiano cheese, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, sea salt, Arugula, Red wine vinegar, 
2.  Spread the nuts loosely on a baking sheet. Toast until lightly browned,  about 10 minutes. Check every few minutes to avoid burning the nuts. Remove  from the oven and turn out onto a large plate to cool.    3. In a large shallow salad bowl, combine the arugula and toasted pine  nuts.  Using a vegetable peeler, shave the Parmesan cheese into long thick strips  directly into the bowl. Season the salad with fine sea salt and toss  gently to  blend.    4. Drizzle 1 tablespoon vinegar over the salad and season with pepper, and  toss to blend. Add just enough oil to very lightly coat the arugula, and  toss  to blend. Serve immediately, arranging on large serving plates.
