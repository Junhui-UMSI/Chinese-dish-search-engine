Pink Cookies
Sugar, Red Jello, Shortening, Baking Powder, Flour, Eggs, Vanilla, Salt, 
Cream together shortening, sugar and Jello until light and fluffy. Add eggs  and vanilla. Continue beating until almost the consistency of whipped  cream. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, and stir in. Mix  thoroughly.    Preheat oven to 375?. Grease cookie sheets. Drop by teaspoonfuls about 2"  apart. Flatten each cookie with the bottom of a wet glass dipped in sugar.  (If you have a glass with a textured bottom that will make a design in the  cookies, so much the better.) Bake about 6-8 minutes until edges are  golden.    Makes 4 to 5 dozen cookies.
