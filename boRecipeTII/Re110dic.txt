King Arthur Pizza
Warm water, Sugar, Active dry yeast, Salt, all purpose, Flour, olive oil, olive oil, 
About 2 hours before needed:    Dissolve in 2 cups warm water in this order:  1 tb each of sugar, dry yeast  and salt.  Blend in with a large spoon 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 cups of flour. You  can also add two tablespoons of olive oil for flavor.    Turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and springy. Clean  and grease your large bowl, place the dough in it, cover and let rise until  doubled in bulk (1 to 2 hours).    Preheat oven to 450.    Punch down dough, divide into 3 - 4 pieces.    Roll out each piece on a floured surface, with a floured rolling pin into  circles that fit into 12 inch pizza pans. (To roll, work from the center to  the outside like pie dough.  Let the dough rest several times to relax it  and make it more cooperative.  Turn it over from time to time and roll the  reverse side.    Brush on a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over  the surface and add own toppings.  Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.    Bake for 15 mins.
