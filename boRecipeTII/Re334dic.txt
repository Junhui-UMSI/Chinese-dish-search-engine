Salt, Lemon Peel, Lemon juice, Powdered sugar, lemon cake mix, Eggs, Shortening, Sugar, Baking Powder, 
From: Abtaxel <Abtaxel@aol.com>    Preheat oven to 350. Combine cake mix, 1egg, and shortening in a bowl; mix  until crumbly. Measure 1 cup and set aside. Pat remaining mix lightly in  ungreased 13x9x2 inch pan. Bake for 15 minutes or until light brown. Beat  remaining two eggs, sugar, baking powder, salt, lemon peel and juice until  light and foamy. Pour over hot crust; sprinkle with reserved 1c crumb  mixture. Bake for another 15 minutes or until light brown. Sprinkle with  powdered sugar. Cool on rack; cut into bars.    AGAIN--BE CREATIVE!!! Try different flavored cake mixes, candy pieces,  nuts; add a touch of extract like almond, coconut, or Creme de Menthe!!    Note: In recipes calling for oil- you can substitute APPLE SAUCE in place  of oil reduced in amount by 25%. In other words, if the recipe calls for  1/2c oil, reduce that by 25% (=6T) and substitute applesauce for the other  75%.
