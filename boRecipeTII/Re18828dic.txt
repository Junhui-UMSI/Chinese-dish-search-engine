Andouille
Salt, Cayenne pepper, Dried thyme, Garlic, Cracked black pepper, Feet beef middle casing, Pork butt, Pork fat, 
Cube pork butt into one and a half inch cubes. Using a meat grinder with  four one quarter inch holes in the grinding plate, grind pork and pork fat.  If you do not have a grinding plate this size, I suggest hand cutting pork  butt into one quarter inch square pieces. Place ground pork in large mixing  bowl and blend in all remaining ingredients. Once well blended, stuff meat  into casings in one foot links, using the sausage attachement on your meat  grinder. Tie both ends of the sausage securely using a heavy gauge twine.  In your homestyle smoker, smoke andouille at 175-200 degrees F for  approximately four to five hours using pecan or hickory wood. The andouille  may then be frozen and used for seasoning gumbos, white or red beans,  pastas or grilling as an hors doeuvre.
