Puppy Go Away
Oil of cloves, Paprika, Black pepper, 
Mix the oil, paprika and pepper and pour it into a small container with a  tight-fitting lid. Label and keep away from children.    To use: Dab it on your furniture legs, chairs, tables, rugs to discourage  puppies from getting on the furniture. The scent will wear off after  awhile, you may have to reapply it if your puppy isnt completely trained.    This solution works to keep puppies away from furniture and rugs. The scent  isnt distasteful to people, only to ultra-"scent"-sitive puppies.
