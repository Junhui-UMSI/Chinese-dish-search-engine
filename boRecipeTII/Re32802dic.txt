Sweet Potato Recipe
Fresh Lemon Juice, Salt & freshly ground pepper, Good-quality bourbon, Dark brown sugar, Finely grated lemon zest, Medium unpeeled sweet, 
With Thanksgiving coming up, I thought a nice low-fat sweet potato recipe  would be nice.  Heres one from the current (Nov) issue of Food & Wine.    1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Pierce the sweet potatoes a few times  and roast them in a large nonstick roasting pan for about 1 hour, or until  soft and browned on the bottom.  Let cool for 15 minutes. Remove the skin,  leaving as much caramelized flesh as possible.  Cut the potatoes into large  chunks and transfer to a food processor.  Add the lemon juice and zest,  season with salt and pepper and process until smooth.    2.  In a large nonreactive saucepan, combine the bourbon and brown sugar  and bring just to a boil.  Add the sweet potatoes and stir until blended.  (MAKE AHEAD: The puree can be refrigerated for up to 1 day). warm over low  heat, then transfer to a large bowl and serve.
