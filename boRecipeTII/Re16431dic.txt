Weizen
Calcium carbonate, Hersbrucker hops (3.4%, Munich malt, Alpha), Wheat malt, 2-row malt, Sierra Nevada yeast, 
This  is a 15-gallon batch. Our beer was 50% malted wheat,  30%  Munich,  and  20% 2-row malt. Medium soft water was used with the addition of  10  grams CaCO4. Mash with 1-1/4 gallons water per pound of grain with rests at  120 degrees (1-1/2 hours), 135 degrees for 45 minutes,  148  degrees for 30  minutes, and 156 degrees until converted. 172  degrees  for  15 minutes. We  took our time with the sparge: 20 minutes to settle in  the lauter tun, at  least 30 minutes of recycling, and 1-1/2 hours to sparge. We cut it off at  a gravity of 1.015 because we werent  getting  sweet- ness, just grainy  notes. The hot break in the boil was the most unbelievable thing Ive ever  seen. It looked like egg drop soup. We took out a sight glass and  grab-  bed a bit and the flocks were huge---as much as 1/2 inch in diameter.
