Good Old-Fashioned Pot Roast
Beef chuck, Cream of mushroom soup, dried onion soup, Yellow onion, fresh herbs, Russet potatoes, Carrots, 
For frozen meat, unwrap the meat and put it into a roasting pan. Spread the  undiluted mushroom soup over the meat and sprinkle the onion soup mix over  the mushroom soup. Place the onion slices over the dried soup. Cover with  foil, making sure the edges are sealed. Place pan in oven and set the time  bake for 4 hours at 275 degrees, so that it will be finished cooking 1 hour  before you want to serve it. One hour before serving, unwrap the foil and  place the prepared vegetables and herbs around the meat. Seal the foil and  continue cooking for an hour. For thawed meat, follow the same procedure,  but reduce the initial cooking time to 2 hours.    NOTES : This recipe had to be invented in the 50s by Mrs. Cleaver; she  probably used frozen peas and carrots. Dont despair over the canned soup  and packaged soup mix; just try it, then scoff if you will. The time-bake  oven gadget was invented for this pot roast; it goes into the oven frozen  before breakfast, and comes out 6 p.m.,  meat-falling-off- the-bone  wonderful. Variations: Use tiny new potatoes or cannellini beans, rinsed  and drained. Use those packaged, peeled small carrots and/or winter root  vegetables. Add 1 fennel bulb, cut in half, then sliced (about 1/3" thick).  Add 1 cup red table wine. Add 1/2 lb. small button mushrooms with stems  removed, or 1/2 lb. fresh wild mushrooms. Add the potatoes, beans, carrots,  fennel, winter roots, or wine at the final hour; add mushrooms 30 minutes  before serving.Yield: 6 servings.
