Peanut Butter Bread - Diary Free (r T)
Chunky Peanut Butter, Active Dry Yeast, Or 1/2 Pkg, Water, Brown sugar, Bread flour, 
This is a really nice snack bread, but its also terrific to send in lunch  boxes for a new twist on the standard peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.    Add all the ingredients to the machine in the order listed. Choose either  regular or light crust (depending on your preference) and push "Start".    Tip: To measure and add the peanut butter put some nonstick cooking spray  or oil in the measuring cup first. The peanut butter will then measure  easily and slide right out.    This recipe is dairy-free    This recipe will work on a "rapid" or "quick bread" setting.    This bread may be prepared on the timer, if you use the timer method,  though, use active dry yeast (rather than compressed) and if you have a  yeast dispenser, use it.    This is very tasty!!
