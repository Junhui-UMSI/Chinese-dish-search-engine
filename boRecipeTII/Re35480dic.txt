Combine the spices in a dish. Cut the meat into strips less than 1/4 of an  inch thick. Remove ALL fat.  Sprinkle one side with the combined seasonings  and beat with a meat hammer. Turn and repeat the seasoning and beating.  Place the strips on a cookie sheet or other flat pan. Place in a 120 F oven  for 4 hrs. Turn and put back for another 4 hrs.
