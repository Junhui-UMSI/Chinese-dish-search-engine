In a bowl beat  together the almond paste and the sugar until the mixture is combined; in  another bowl beat the whites until they are very frothy, beat in the almond  paste mixture and the almond extract, and beat the mixture for 2-3 minutes,  or until it is combined well.  Drop the dough by teaspoons 2 inches apart  onto buttered and floured baking sheets, press about 7 pine nuts into each  macaroon, and bake the macaroons in the upper third of a preheated 350F  oven for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden.  Let the macaroons cool  on the sheets for 5 minutes, transfer them to racks, and let cool  completely. Store the pine nut macaroons in airtight containers. Makes  about 36 biscotti.
