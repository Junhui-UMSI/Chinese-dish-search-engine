Source: Kosher Cookery By Frances R. AvRutick    With a sharp heavy knife, cut the squash in half. Remove the seeds and  stringy portions. Cut into large pieces, peel, then cut into 1 1/2 inch  cubes. In a saucepan, place the squash cubes, onion, salt, and hot water to  measure about 1/2 inch deep. Cover tightly and simmer until fork tender, 12  to 15 minutes. While the squash is cooking, prepare the glaze of your  choice.    Sweet Cinammon Glaze:    In a small saucepan, combine all the ingredients. Cook over medium heat  until the margarine or butter are blended with other ingredients and the  glaze is hot.    Savory Garlic Glaze:    In a small saucepan, saute the garlic in the oil until golden, stirring  constantly. Do not let the garlic brown too much. Stir in the parsley,  lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Blend together. When the squash is done,  drain well. Arrange the squash cubes on a serving dish and spoon the glaze  over all.
