FOR AMARETTO CREAM: Whisk yolks and sugar in bowl to blend. Pour cream into  heavy medium saucepan.  Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into cream; add  bean.  Bring to boil.

Transfer to bowl. Press plastic wrap  directly onto surface of cream to prevent skin from forming. Chill until  cold. (Can be made 4 days ahead. Keep chilled). Remove vanilla bean.    FOR TART: Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add apricots and  1/3 cup sugar.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add bean. Cook until  apricots are tender, fall apart and form thick puree, stirring  occasionally, about 15 minutes for canned apricots and 30 minutes for  fresh. Cool. Remove vanilla bean. Sweeten mixtrue with more sugar, if  desired.    Preheat oven to 425F.  Roll out pastry on floured surface to 12x16-inch  rectangle.  Cut in half lengthwise, forming two 6x16 inch rectangles. Place  1 rectangle in center of baking sheet. Spread apricots evenly over pastry,  leaving 3/4 inch border on all sides. Brush border with egg glaze. Place  second rectangle atop filling. Press edges firmly to seal. Brush with  glaze.  To form rim, fold up 1/2 inch of edge all around; press to seal.  Brush top with glaze; sprinkle with sugar. Using small sharp knife, make  diagonal cuts 2 inches apart across tart, cutting just to filling. Bake  until golden, about 25 minutes. Cool. Serve with amaretto cream.
