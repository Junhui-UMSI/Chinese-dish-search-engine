Combine nuts, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Brush a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking  pan well with butter.  Separate 25 phyllo sheets from package. Place under  a smooth, damp towel to prevent drying. Wrap remaining filo well. Freeze  for future use.  Place one phyllo sheet in pan. Trim to fit. Brush  generously with melted butter. Repeat procedure until there are 5 layers of  buttered phyllo in the pan. Sprinkle with 1/4 nut mixture. Repeat this  procedure two more times, ending with phyllo. Drizzle any remaining butter  over top.  Bake in 350 degree oven 1-1/2 hours or until golden brown.  Remove baklava from oven. Using a sharp knife, immediately cut long,  diagonal lines from corner to corner, forming an "X". Follow these  guidelines to cut baklava into serving-size diamonds. While still hot, pour  cooled syrup over baklava.    Syrup:  Combine sugar, water, orange and lemon rinds, cloves and cinnamon  stick in saucepan.  Bring to boil. Simmer, uncovered, about 5 minutes to  thicken syrup slightly. Remove from heat. Discard spices. Stir in honey.  Cool at room temperature.  Pour over hot baklava. Allow to stand overnight  before serving.    From: "Classic Greek Cooking" by Daphne Metaxas. ISBN: 0-911954-31-7    Typed for you by Karen Mintzias
