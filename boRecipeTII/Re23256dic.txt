For an excellent luncheon dish,  serve large puffs with a creamed mushroom sauce."    Finely chop the tuna in a wooden chopping bowl. Add the chopped almonds.  Mix together and set aside. In a medium sized saucepan, pour the cup of  tuna liquid and water mixture, add the oil, salt, parsley, grated onion and  pepper. Bring to a boil. Add the cup of matzo meal all at once. Beat  rapidly over low heat until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan and  forms a smooth compact ball. Set aside to cool a bit. Add the eggs one at a  time, beating hard with a spoon after each addition, until the mixture is  shiny. Add the tuna mixture. Blend thoroughly. Drop the mixture by the  heaping tbs-ful onto a greased baking sheet. Do not crowd them; leave room  for expansion. Bake in a preheated 450 degree F oven for 10 minutes. Turn  the heat down to 350 degrees F and continue baking for an additional 30-45  minutes, until brown. Serve hot. Posted to JEWISH-FOOD digest V97 #081 by  alotzkar@direct.ca (Al) on Mar 9, 1997
