Cut the stems and the top 1/4" from each baby artichoke. Snap off the outer  green leaves. Trim all dark green from the bottom. Cut into quarters. Rub  cut surfaces with lemon half.    Heat oil in large covered skillet or sauce pan.  Add quartered artichokes.  Saute, stirring often, until golden brown (about 7 minutes). Add onion and  garlic. Saute until soft (about 2 minutes). Add wine, allow to reduce  slightly (another 2 minutes, perhaps) and then stir in tomatoes, water and  thyme.  Cover.  Cook over low heat until very tender, 30 minutes.    Boil water for penne.    Remove cover from artichokes.  Add salt and red pepper flakes to taste.  Cook, uncovered for five minutes to slightly thicken sauce. Shave parmesan.  Cook penne.    Drain penne, and toss with artichokes and minced parsley. Serve warm or at  room temperature, topped with shavings of parmesan cheese.
