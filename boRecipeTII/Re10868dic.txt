1. Toast quinoa, stirring, in nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, 5  minutes. Bring broth and water to boil in medium saucepan; stir in quinoa.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes until liquid  is absorbed and quinoa is tender. Fluff with fork and transfer to large  bowl; cover and keep warm.    2. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and  garlic; cook 3 minutes. Stir in broccoli rabe, salt and red pepper. Cook  until broccoli rabe is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir vegetables into quinoa.  Serve warm or at room temperature.    Makes about 5 cups.    The slightly nutty flavor of quinoa blends perfectly with pungent broccoli  rabe, garlic and red pepper flakes in this quick and easy salad. Toasting  the grain in a skillet until fragrant enhances its delicate taste.
