Fresh orange juice, Fresh Lemon Juice, Honey, Avocado, orange zest, Whole chives, Cantaloupe, dill, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Shallots, Chives, Cucumber, salmon, Fresh dill, 
1. Toss the avocado with the lemon juice. Add the cucumber, cantaloupe,  snipped chives, chopped dill and shallots; toss the salad gently.      2. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons  orange juice, 1 teaspoon honey and the orange zest until slightly  thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Toss with the salad before serving.      3. For the marinade, combine the remaining olive oil, orange juice and  honey. Brush over the salmon and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.      4. Oil the grill rack well. Place the salmon on grill, flesh-side down, 3  inches from heat source; cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning carefully after 4  minutes and brushing with the marinade. The salmon should be lightly  browned and crisp on the surface, cooked through near the edges and rarer  in the center. Remove to a cutting board with a large spatula.      5. Divide the salad among 4 plates. Slice the salmon into 4 equal portions  and place atop each salad. Garnish each with a whole chive and a sprig of  dill.    Serves 4.

Since there is honey in the marinade to caramelize the salmon while it  cooks, be sure to oil the grill well to keep the fish from sticking.
