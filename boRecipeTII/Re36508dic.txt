Strawberries and Rice
Cream, Gelatine, Salt, milk, Lemon juice, Cold water, Rice (uncooked), Sugar, 
Heat the milk in double boiler. Add rice, well washed, and salt and cook  until the rice is tender, and the milk is nearly all absorbed. Stir in  carefully the sugar and add gelatine which has been softened in cold water  and dissolved over steam. When the mixture is partly cold, add lemon juice  and when it is  beginning to set stir in lightly the cream which has been  whipped. turn into a wet mold and set on ice to cool. Turn out and serve  with strawberry sauce.    These are rather fun, but now we have to call the iceman.    Ive looked to no avail, there is no recipe in the book for Strawberry  sauce. It may have been so common that everyone knew how to make it? But we  will give you some pudding...
