Lemon Marmalade
Water, Lemons, Sugar, 
Mrs. L. J. Snots    This marmalade would need to be canned like any other preserve. To be more  sure of gelling, add green apple juice or commercial pectin.    Slice the lemons thin, removing the seeds; add 3 pts. of cold water to each  pound of fruit, after cutting. Let it stand 24 hours, then boil until  tender; pour into an earthen bowl until the following day. Weigh it, and to  every pound of boiled fruit add 1 1/2 lbs. of lump sugar; boil the whole  together until the syrup jellies and the chips are rather transparent.
