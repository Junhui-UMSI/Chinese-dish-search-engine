Carols Gizzard Soup
Cumin, Salt, Pepper, Dash tobasco, Set of gizzards from chicken, Water, 
Ok, what to do with them gizzards ya got stowed away from all them chickens  ya cooked?    This one is flexible.  I showed cumin this time, but chinese 5 spice, or  just about anything else will do.  Ok, oregano would be awful but you  hopefully have the idea! Remove the skin and as much fat as easily done  then:    Toss it in the pot and boil it for 2 hours on low simmer.
