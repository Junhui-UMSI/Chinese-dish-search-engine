Quatre-Epices (French 4 Spice Blend)
Black peppercorns, Doves, nutmeg, Dried ginger, 
The standard French "four-spice" blend is based on pepper. It is commonly  used in charcuterie and in dishes that need long simmering, such as stews.  Sometimes cinnamon or allspice is used in the blend.    Grind all the ingredients to a fine powder. In an airtight container, the  mixture will keep for 3-4 months.
