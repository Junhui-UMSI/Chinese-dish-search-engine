To prepare hens for stuffing, remove the skin from the backbone area  and set aside. Cut out the backbone, open the hen and remove all  bones except the drumsticks. Boil the wild rice until tender, cool  and stuff hens. Close the hen with drumsticks in the air and use the  skin from the backbone to wrap the hen so it will stand in the baking  pan breast side up. Season hens with salt and pepper. Roast at 350F  for 45 minutes to 1 hour.~ ~ SAUCE: Combine the orange juice, lemon  juice and brown sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Use  cornstarch mixed with a little water to achieve desired thickness.  Stir in liqueur and peel and keep warm.~ ~ Chef Tommy Chan of  Smugglers Inn - Calgary Sun - Monday, June 18/90    File ftp://ftp.idiscover.co.uk/pub/food/mealmaster/recipes/mmkah001.zip
