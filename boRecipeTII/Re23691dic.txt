Artichoke Oyster Soup
Thyme, Cayenne pepper, Oysters, drained; reserve, Parsley (chopped, fresh), Flour, Artichoke hearts, cooked, Whipping cream, Butter, Chicken broth, Bay leaf, Tabasco, Salt, Shallots (chopped fine), 
In a 3-quart casserole, melt butter and saute shallots. When shallots are  translucent, add thyme, bay leaf and cayenne pepper. Add flour and whisk  well.  Add broth, oyster water, artichoke hearts, salt and tabasco. Bring  to a boil. Add oysters and parsley. Simmer on medium, partly covered, for  exactly 5 minutes. Add whipped cream and serve immediately.    NOTES:    *  Chicken broth with artichokes and poached oysters ~- This is a modern  cajun-style recipe that I adapted from a local convenience-food cookbook by  Jean Durkee. Its an intriguing combination of modern American ingredients  with traditional cajun flavorings.    *  Fresh parsley tastes much better than dried parsley. If the oysters are  bigger than a small bite-size, cut them up before adding them to the soup.  Use the smallest oysters you can find.    *  When Im not making a double recipe, I usually dump the entire (about  1-cup) container of whipping cream into the soup, even though thats double  what the recipe calls form.    *  The timing on cooking the oysters is fairly critical. If you overcook  them, they will be rubbery.    : Difficulty:  easy.  : Time:  20 minutes.  : Precision:  measure the spices.    : Deborah Pedersen  : Microelectronics Computer Corporation, Austin TX  : pedersen@mcchi2.ARPA    : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust
