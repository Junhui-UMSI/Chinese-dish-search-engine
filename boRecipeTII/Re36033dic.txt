What is a recipe from Indonesia doing in an American cookbook? Because  peanuts came from the Americas to Indonesia, thats why. And besides, I  love this recipe. Great for the barbecue!      Cut the meat into thin strips, being careful to remove the fat. Mix the  marinade and soak the meat strips for at least 1/2 hour. Put the meat on  bamboo skewers in an S pattern.      Prepare the sauce by grinding the peanuts in a food blender or  medium-sized food processor. Place in a bowl and add all other ingredients  for the sauce.      Broil the sticks of meat over charcoal or under the broiler. Cook just  until barely browned, about 4 minutes on each side. You want the meat to be  fairly rare and tender.      Spoon the sauce over the meat when you serve.      I like a sliced cucumber salad with a Vinaigrette Dressing You need add  only plain Steamed Rice and the menu is complete (see recipes).    NOTE: This sauce is great on other meat dishes as well. And I love it on  fish.    From <The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American>.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
