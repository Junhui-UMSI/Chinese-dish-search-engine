Vanilla Custard - Bon Appetit
Vanilla bean; split, Egg yolks, Sugar, Whipping cream, 
Using the whole vanilla bean gives this custard a wonderful unique taste!    Place cream in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Scrape in the seeds from  the vanilla bean; add pod. Bring to simmer. Remove from heat. Cover and let  stand 1 hour to let flavors marry.    Whisk yolks and sugar in medium bowl to blend. Bring cream mixture to  simmer over medium-low heat. Gradually whisk hot cream into yolks. Return  mixture to saucepan and stir until the custard thickens and coats spoon  (about 4 minutes). Do not boil. Strain into bowl. Cover and chill.
