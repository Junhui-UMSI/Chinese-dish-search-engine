Philippine Chicken
Chicken Breasts skinned, Water, Vinegar, Garlic, Soy sauce, 
Put in crockpot. Cook for 6 to 8 hrs on LOW. Serve over rice. The  original  recipe used 1 chicken, cut up.   Gayes Notes: I used frozen, boneless  chicken  breasts straight fromthe freezer and reduced the water to 3/4 cup. This is  the  best "new"   recipe I have tried in ages.   Posted by Gaye Levy.
