Truffles #2
Heavy cream, Bittersweet chocolate, Butter (softened), 
From: arielle@taronga.com (Stephanie da Silva) (collection)    Date: Wed, 4 Aug 93 22:31:07 CDT  Boil the cream until it thickens.  Add the chocolate (broken so it melts  faster) and heat until melted.  Add butter and stir till melted and mixed.  Then whisk in 3 tablespoons of your favorite liqueur, pour into a bowl and  chill.  Stir several times during the chilling process, and when the stuff  is firm, shape it into balls and roll in cocoa, or whatever strikes your  fancy. I made:      Kahlua dipped in chocolate      Drambuie rolled in cocoa      mint/Baileys rolled in powdered sugar      Frangelico rolled in chopped nuts,      Rum rolled in granulated sugar with cinnamon.    Store them in the fridge, and bring them out shortly before serving to  soften up some.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES ARCHIVES    /CANDY    From rec.food.cooking archives.
