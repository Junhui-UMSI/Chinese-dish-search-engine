Hi! In response to K.D.D. who wanted a butternut squash soup, I got this  recipe from an Albert Stockli cookbook, Splendid Fare, years ago; and it  has long been a Thanksgiving favorite. I make my own stock and I substitute  Coffee Rich or Farm Rich with no loss of texture or flavor. You could also  substitute butternut squash for pumpkin in any pumpkin soup recipe. Enjoy!  Paula    Combine the squash halves, apples, onion, herbs, stock, bread cubes, salt,  and pepper in a large heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered  for about 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.    Scoop the flesh of the squash out, discard the skins, and return the pulp  to the soup. Puree the soup in the blender or food processor until smooth.  You will probably have twoo blender loads. Return the pureeed soup to the  saucepan.    In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks and cream together. Beat in a little of  the hot soup, then stir back into the saucepan. Heat but do not boil, and  serve immediately.
