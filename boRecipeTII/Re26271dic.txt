Tomato and Caramelized Onion Galette
Dried Rosemary, Salt and freshly ground pepper, Fresh rosemary, Egg, Yellow onions, Dried thyme, cherry tomatoes, Gorgonzola cheese, Fresh thyme, Yeast Dough, olive oil, 
In a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan, cook the onions and thyme over  moderate heat, stirring once or twice, until the onions start to turn  golden, about 15 minutes.    Add 3 tablespoons of the oil, cover and cook over low heat, scraping the  pan every 10 minutes, until the onions are browned, about 1 hour. Season  with salt and pepper and 2 teaspoons of the fresh rosemary (or all the  dried rosemary).  Let cool.    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  On a lightly floured baking sheet without  sides, roll out the galette dough into a 14-inch round. (Alternatively,  divide the dough into 4 even pieces and roll into 8-inch rounds.) Spread  the filling over the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Crumble the cheese on  top and overlap the tomatoes in a ring. Season with salt and pepper and  drizzle on the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Fold up and pleat the border of  the dough.  Brush the dough with the egg.    Bake the galette until the crust is golden, about 20 minutes for Yeast  Dough and 35 minutes for Pie Dough. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon fresh  rosemary over the top and serve hot or warm.
