Strawberry Melon Wedges (Motts)
Unsweetened Apple Sauce, Plain yogurt, Sugar-free gelatin, Cantaloupe or honeydew, Sliced fresh strawberries, 
In a small saucepan, heat apple sauce until boiling. Stir in gelatin. Chill  until very thick but not set, about 15 minutes.    Stir in yogurt. Beat at highest speed until doubled in volume.    Stir in strawberries.    Cut melons in half; remove seeds and pat dry with paper towels.    Spoon whipped mixture into melon halves. Chill until firm.    To serve, cut each half; garnish as desired.    Yields 8 to 12 servings.    Notes: Pantry: Motts Natural Apple Sauce. Purchase the cantaloupes a few  days before you plan this light refreshing dessert and allow them to ripen  at room temperature. When ripe, a cantaloupe should yield when pressed  gently and have a fragrant aroma.    >Hanneman/Buster 1998-Apr    Recipe by: Motts Applesauce www.motts.com    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest by KitPATh <phannema@wizard.ucr.edu> on Apr 18,  1998
