Egg yolks., Bread, Broth, Vegetable oil, Water, Soysauce; up to 2, Pepper, Salt, Chicken, Little onions; up to 5, Some parsley, 
Cut the chicken open at the back, and remove the skin. (careful, you need  it) Mince the meat of the chicken. Chop the onions and the parsley very  finely. Soak the bread in the water. Mix the minced meat with salt, pepper,  onions, parsley, egg yolks and bread. Stuff the skin with this all and sew  it up at the upside. (?? maybe bad English. sorry). Broil the chicken in  the oil brown on both sides, and add the soyauce and some broth. Sprinkle  the chicken when broiling. When it starts expanding, prick with a  knittingneedle in it, to avoid it will burst.    Eat it with white rice, vegetables and HOT STUFF.
