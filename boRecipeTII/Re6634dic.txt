Poke Cake
9 Inch Round White Cake, (4-Serving Size) Any Flavor, Tub (12 Oz.) Cool Whip;, Boiling water, (4-Serving Size) Any Flavor, 
Place the cake layers, top sides up, in two 9-inch cake pans. Pierce cake  with large fork at 1/2-inch intervals. Stir 1 cup of the boiling water into  each flavor gelatin in separate bowls 2 minutes or until completely  dissolved. Carefully pour one flavor over each cake layer. Refrigerate 3  hours. Dip 1 cake pan in warm water 10 seconds and unmold onto a serving  plate. Spread with about 1 cup of the whipped topping. Unmold the second  layer and place on top of the first layer. Frost with remaining Cool Whip.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  NOTES : I have seen this cake prepared in a 13x9 pan with excellent       results.       However, I believe the cake must be left in the pan to serve.       Possible combinations of flavors:       lemon/lime       any flavor red gelatin/lime for the Christmas holidays.
