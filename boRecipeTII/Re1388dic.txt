Eggnog
Eggs, Plus 2 TBs "superfine", Half & half, Heavy cream, Either Corvoisier Cognac, Pinch of salt, Vanilla extract, Fresh nutmeg for grating, 
1. Whip together the egg yolks and 1/3 c bar (superfine) sugar til sugar  dissolves and egg yolks take on a pale lemony colour    2. add half & half and the rum and cognac/whiskey    3. add the vanilla and grate on *some* fresh nutmeg    4. place this mixture in the refrigerator for up to two hours (preferably  all of these steps have been done in a very clean stainless steel bowl)    5. After two hours, the egg/half&half/coganc mix should become thick    6. In a separate stainlees steel bowl whip the reserved egg whites (which  also should have been refrigerated all this time!) till they become frothy.  Add the pinch of salt, continue whipping til *soft* peaks form. Sprinkle on  the 2 TBs sugar and continue whipping on high speed til *stiff*peaks form.  (Do not OVER whip or the egg yolks will break down!)    7. Withe a rubber spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the egg/half&  half/liquor mixture until well incorporated.    8. Whip the heavy cream (in a separate bowl, oruse the now empty egg WHITE  bowl) till lightly but firmly whipped    9. Fold the heavy cream into the mixture.    10. Place egg nog into a punch bowl, or directly into glass/cs. Grate more  FRESH nutmeg on the top if desired.    Helpful hints: (in case i made a mistake on ingredients)    1. The original eggyolk/H&H/liquor mix after two hours in frig should be  thick and creamy (a result of the alcohol "cooking" the egg yolks.) IF it  seems TOOO thick (you canstand a spoon in it, e.g, you may need to add a  little more half & half)    2. The sugar in the recipe can be increased to 1/2 c if you want to *mask*  the flavour of the alcohol more (or decreased to 1/4 c if you want a more  potent brew!)    3. The real trick is knowing how to properly whip egg whites and how to  properly FOLD them and the heavy cream into the base mixture. You want to  completely incorporated all so you end up with a frothy, airy, almost  "Ambrosial" consistency throughout. Too much folding deflates the egg  whites and turns them back into egg water. Too little folding leaves you  with egg white *pockets* scattered throughout your drink.    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by "Phillip Waters" <muddy@ibm.net> on Nov 7,  1998
