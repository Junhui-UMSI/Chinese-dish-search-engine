Potato/cabbage Box (Quick Lunch)
Cabbage chopped coarsly, Potatoes, Minced chives, Black pepper, Salt, Paprika, Dozen or more mushrooms, 
Layer into lunch box in this order. Do not mix. Mix at work and nuke for 10  minutes on high.    Option: I would think this would be good with some caraway seed or Oregano  added. I could also imagine using 2 teaspoons of sweet curry instead of the  pepper and paprika.    From: vmh@intellicorp.com (Valerie). Fatfree Digest [Volume 10 Issue 35],  Sept. 15, 1994.
