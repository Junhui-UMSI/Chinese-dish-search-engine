From: Linda Shapiro <lss@coconet.com>    Date: Tue, 02 Jul 1996 13:19:51 -0400  The challah stuffing discussions made me think of something I got from the  list (was it, you, Andrea??) when I first joined back in February..    It wasnt a real recipe if I recall, but a variation to a braided  challah...    Here is my rendition...    Apple Stuffed Challah... it was heavenly!!  The smell in my kitchen was  incredible....    It is so easy, too..    Just flatten your ropes and place a thin line of diced apples that have  been sauteed in a little brown sugar and cinnamon. (Make sure it is drained  well, or it will ooze out of the challah.)    Roll each rope up like a jelly roll and seal both ends.    Then carefully braid the ropes..    Let rise for about 45 minutes to an hour.  Brush with egg wash and sprinkle  with cinnamon and sugar and bake.    I promise you will be in heaven!!
