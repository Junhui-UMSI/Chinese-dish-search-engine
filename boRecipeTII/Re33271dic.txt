Heat butter and oil in 14"X11"x2" dish or large casserole dish, uncovered  at High for 2 minutes. Add onions and stir to coat. Cook, uncovered at high  for 4 minutes. Add rice and stir to coat. Cook, uncovered for 4 minutes  more. Stir in broth (homemade is best; it has the best flavour). Cook,  uncovered for 12 minutes more. Remove from oven. Let stand uncovered for 5  minutes, to let rice absorb remaining liquid, stirring several times. Stir  in salt, pepper and Parmesan if desired.    **Arborio rice is the best rice for Risotto. It is a short grained Italian  rice; available in grocery stores in cities with large Italian populations,  Italian food shops and gourmet food stores. Using North American rice will  not produce the right creamy texture.
