Brandy, Flat anchovy fillets, Capers, rinsed and drained, All-purpose flour, Vegetable oil, Boiled ham, finely minced, Veal loin chops, 3/4" thick, Chopped fresh parsley, Whipping cream, Butter, 
Heat oil in a heavy skillet large enough to accommodate chops. Pat chops  dry and coat with flour, shaking off excess. Saute chops in very hot oil,  turning once.    Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet and saute ham over medium heat 1  minute. Add anchovies and capers, mashing ingredients down with fork to  make a paste.    When chops are done, about 8 to 10 minutes, remove to a heated ovenproof  platter and keep warm in a 200 degree oven with a piece of aluminum foil  placed loosely over the top.    Pour off excess oil from skillet in which chops were cooked. Add brandy,  scraping up browned bits. Boil to reduce liquid by half, then pour into ham  and anchovy mixture. Add cream, heating and stirring while it blends.    Pour sauce over chops and garnish with parsley. Serves 6.
