*    Use cooked fresh kernels or canned or cooked frozen.    Cook the diced salt pork over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, so  that all of the pork pieces become brown but not too dry.  Remove them  from the pan with a slotted spoon.  Saute the onion in the pork fat just  until tender, but not brown.  Add the water, corn, potatoes and salt,  cooking, uncovered, until the potatoes are almost soft.  Add the milk and  simmer very gently for 10 to 15 minutes to let the flavor ripen.  Taste  for seasoning, adding a good bit of freshly ground pepper.  Sprinkle the  surface with the salt pork and serve with a large supply of soda crackers.
