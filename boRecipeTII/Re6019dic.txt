Pittu
Coconut, Rice flour, Salt, Thick coconut milk, Hot water, 
Roast and sieve the flour well. Grate  the coconut. Place the flour in a  bowl and add the salt.  Slowly pour in the hot water, mixing with your  fingers as you do so until it resembles breadcrumbs. Add the grated coconut  and mix well in. Place the mixture in the pittu mould and place over a pan  of boiling water until steam emerges from the top of the pittu mould. Cover  with  half a  coconut  shell  and steam for a further 5 minutes or until  done.    Note:  If a pittu mould is not available, mould dough into loaf shape, wrap  in muslin and steam   for about 15 minutes. From "A taste of Sri Lanka" by  Indra Jayasekera, ISBN #962 224 010 0
