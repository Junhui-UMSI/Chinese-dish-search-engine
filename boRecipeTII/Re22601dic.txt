Grease and flour a large tube pan or 2 loaf pans. Preheat oven to 325  degrees. Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, one at a time, beating  thoroughly after each addition. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and  salt. Combine sour cream, flavorings, and brandy. Alternately add the flour  and sour cream mixture to the sugar mixture, beginning and ending with dry  ingredients. Mix until well blended.    Pour into prepared pan or pans. Bake for about 70 minutes. A crack will  usually form in the center. Cool for about 30 minutes, then remove from pan  and cool completely. Dust with confectioners sugar, or glaze, if desired.    Glaze: Mix just enough brandy with the sugar to form a thin mixture. Use a  brush to cover the surface of the cake.    Helpful hint: I buy small paintbrushes when they are on sale, and use these  for such jobs. I put them in the dishwasher. When they get worn, I toss  them and get new ones. They are great for brushing on bbq sauce on grilled  meats, glazing cakes, and many other uses.
