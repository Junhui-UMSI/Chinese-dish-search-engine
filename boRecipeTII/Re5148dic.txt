Pierogi Mushroom Filling
Onion -- chopped, Shiitake mushrooms -- soaked, Pepper -- to taste, Salt -- to taste, And chopped, Button mushrooms, 
Tradition is to use Polish Mushrooms, or as those of you familiar critters,  Polish Gold - they are VERY expensive, and often VERY hard to come by. I  use a combination of Shitake (sp) and button mushrooms.  Soak Shitake  mushrooms in warm water for atleast an hour. Chop 1 lb button mushrooms  roughly and 1/2 medium onion and saute in butter until mushrooms cook down.  Chop Shitake mushrooms fine and add mushrooms AND WATER THEY HAVE BEEN  SOAKING IN  to pan & simmer 5-6 min, until liquid starts to evaporate. Salt  & pepper lightly. (This holds nicely in the refrigerator - if you make the  mushrooms the day before you make the pierogis, they will absorb more  flavor from the cooking liquid - or so it seems, but Im not a chemist).  When filling pierogis, squeeze liquid from mushrooms - if filling is too  moist it will run out of the dough.    Now, when my wife and I make them I also make mashed potatoes, and let them  cool a little.  Then I get some sharp cheddar cheese and cut it into very  small pieces and add it and a little dill, salt, and pepper to the  potatoes.  This makes a wonderful stuffing as well.
