Beans in the Pot - Master Recipe
Whole garlic cloves; peeled, Bay leaves or sprigs, Medium onions; chopped, Pinto beans; cranberry, 
Place beans in large pot; add water to cover by at least 2 inches. Soak  overnight or use quick-cook method: Bring to a boil, cook 2 minutes, then  remove from heat, cover and let sit for 1 hour.    Drain beans, then return to pot and add wataer to cover by 1 inch. Add  onions and garlic. For a Mexican flavor, add cilantro and mint; for an  Italian flavor, add a bay leaf or two.    Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered, stirring once or  twice, for 1 1/2 - 2 hours, or until the beans are tender. Add water as  needed, enough to cover beans with a little extra on top, but dont add too  much or the beans "drown" and their flavor is compromised. Season to taste  with salt.    Yields about 6 cups of cooked beans.    Recipe by: SF Chronicle; Jun 7, 1995 - WEEKEND COOK    Posted to MC-Recipe Digest V1 #1000 by Judi Moseley <judi@moseleygroup.com>  on Jan 10, 1998
