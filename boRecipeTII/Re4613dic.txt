Pflaumenkuchen (Plum Cake)
butter, Sugar, Purple plums, Flour, Salt, Vanilla, Apricot jam, Egg yolks, 
make a dough from the first 6 ingredients, press into cookie sheet with  your fingers, forming a rim.  Spread thin layer of peach or apricot jam on  top of dough. Now put your plums (which have been quartered) in rows on the  dough.  Beat egg whites slightly and brush over plums, sprinkle two TBL of  flour over egg whites. Bake at 375 degrees for 40 minutes. If too sour  shake some powdered sugar on top.    This can also be made in the winter substituting apples for the plums.    recipe by: Herta Small (my mom) Typos by: Molli
