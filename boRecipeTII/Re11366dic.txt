Mix seasonings and soy sauce and rub over the chicken pieces. Cover and  refrigerate overnight to marinate. The next day, bake marinated chicken in  350F oven for 1-1/2 hours. Meanwhile, make the sauce by blending all  ingredients in blender or food processor until smooth. When chicken has  cooked for 1-1/2 hours, remove from the oven and dip each piece in blended  sauce mixture.  Return chicken to oven and bake an additional 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, boil remaining sauce for 15 to 20 minutes, or until thickened.  Serve hot sauce with the chicken.
