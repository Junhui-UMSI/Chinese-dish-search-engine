No recipe provided for tonkatsu sauce, purchase at oriental market - HB    Slash the fat rimming one side of the loin cutlet to keep the meat from  curling when deepfried. Pound to flatten to about 1/4inch. Salt and pepper  both sides of each cutlet. Dredge each in flour, then dip into beaten eggs  and press into bread crumbs to coat both sides.    Heat a large skillet with about 1/2inch of oil until hot. Lay 1 or 2  cutlets in the hot oil. Deepfry until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes,  turning them once or twice. Drain the cutlets on paper towels and cut the  pork into bitesize strips that can be eaten with chopsticks.    Arrange the pork on a platter lined with the shredded cabbage, and garnish  with lemon wedges. Serve the sauce on the side for dipping, or pour it over  the pork and cabbage.    Yield: 4 servings    Variation: TURKEY TONKATSU Prepare the recipe for Pork Tonkatsu, using 4  turkey cutlets, each about 1/2inch thick, in place of the pork loin.
