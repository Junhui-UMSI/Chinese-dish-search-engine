In a saucepan, boil potatoes in salted water 15-20 minutes or until tender.  Drain well, return to saucepan and shake over low heat a few moments or  until dry. Mash well. Cook peas in boiling salted water 4 minutes. Drain  well.    Heat oil in a skillet. Add onion, cumin seeds, ginger, turmeric, Garam  Masala and salt. Cook gently 5 minutes. Add mashed potatoes and peas, then  stir in lemon juice. Mix well, remove from heat and cool.    Sift flour into a bowl. Cut in butter finely until mixture resembles bread  crumbs. Add milk and mix to form a stiff dough. Divide in 6 equal pieces.    Form each piece in a ball and roll each ball on a lightly floured surface  to a 6" circle. Cut each circle in half. Divide filling equally among  semicircles of pastry.    Dampen edges of pastry, then fold over and seal to form triangles which  enclose filling completely. Half fill a deep-fat fryer or saucepan with  oil. Heat oil to 375F. (190C.) or until a 1/2" cube of day-old bread  browns in 40 seconds. Fry samosa in hot oil, a few at a time, 3-4 minutes  or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Garnish with lime twists and  celery leaves, if desired, and serve hot with Mango Chutney.    Makes 12 samosa.
