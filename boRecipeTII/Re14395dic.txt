I thought I would share a nice whole wheat bread recipe I have adapted over  the months. It works really well and I get a good rise out of it. I use a  Zoji on the quick bread setting (believe it or not). It works.    Add all ingredients to pan in order listed. Set machine on quick or rapid  cycle. OR you can play around with it to see which setting works best for  you. Posted to Digest bread-bakers.v097.n021 by Vickie Kelley  <vickie@poincare.atmos.colostate.edu> on Mar 10, 1997
