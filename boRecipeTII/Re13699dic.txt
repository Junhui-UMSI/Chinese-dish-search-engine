Wild Rice and Sweet Potatoes Quick Lunch
Salt to taste. (I put quite, Potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch, To 2 T fresh chopped, A bit for this dish.), Cooked Wild Rice, Cooked Basmati Rice, To 2 uncooked sweet, Pieces, Parsley, 
Fill into plastic lunch box. Mix for cooking. Nuke for 10 minutes on high.    Note: This can also be made using a pre-cooked sweet potato. Then the nuke  time is reduced to 3 minutes for reheating.    Variation: I think this would be good with a couple of table spoons of  orange juice for extra flavoring added before cooking.
