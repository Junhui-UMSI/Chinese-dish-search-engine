To  the best of my knowledge, these biscuits earned their name because they  were a favoured item in food parcels sent by families to Australian troops  serving overseas in WW2. The biscuit is nourishing, keeps well, isnt  reduced to crumbs through rough handling, and can be softened by a dunking  in hot tea. (Though personally I prefer ice-cold creamy milk.)    Mix all the dry ingredients together. Melt butter and syrup in a saucepan,  add soda and water, pour over dry ingredients. Mix well.  Drop pieces the  size of walnuts onto greased trays, leaving room for them to spread to  about 2 1/2 inches. Cook about 15 minutes in a slow oven, until a golden  brown.  When taken from the oven biscuits are very soft, so leave on the  tray for one minute, then cool on a wire rack till crisp.
