Briefly toast tortilla in a dry 6-inch non-stick skillet for a minute or  two on each side. Set tortilla aside. Add olive oil, onions and garlic to  pan and saute until crisp tender over moderate heat. Add tomato, hot sauce  and shrimp and saute for 1 minute more. Stir in cilantro and season to  taste with salt, pepper and drops of lime juice. Immediately sprinkle  cheese over shrimp mixture and lay tortilla on top, gently pressing down to  form an even layer.
