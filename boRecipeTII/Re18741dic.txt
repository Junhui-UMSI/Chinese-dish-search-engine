Add 2 T. butter, the  molasses and salt; let stand until lukewarm. Add the yeast to the 1/2 cup  lukewarm water, sprinkle with sugar, cover and let stand until foaming and  doubled in volume. Add to corn meal mixture. Stir in the flour, gradually,  just enough to make a stiff dough. Knead well for 10 minutes. Place in a  warm greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in bulk. Cut through  dough several times with a knife. Cover and let rise again for 45 minutes  until doubled in bulk. Toss lightly on a floured board. Knead and mold into  two loaves. Place in greased and lightly floured bread pans. Cover and let  rise again until doubled in bulk. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes;  reduce heat to 375 degrees and continue to bake until the loaves are golden  brown. Brush bread with warm melted butter and turn on sides on a cooling  rack to cool.    REC.FOOD.RECIPES    From rec.food.cooking archives.  Downloaded from G Internet,  G Internet.
