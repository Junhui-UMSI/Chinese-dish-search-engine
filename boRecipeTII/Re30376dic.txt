[I generally double this recipe, and it freezes very well.]    >From: Billy Hatcher <0002040826@mcimail.com>  From: Bread-Bakers Archives: ftp.best.com/pub/reggie/archives/bread/recipe  NOTES : The following is the best (and most forgiving) banana bread recipe       Ive come       across.  Dont recall where I got the original, but have modified       it quite a       bit, so it is pretty much my own.  I use it if I happen to have       some grossly       over ripe bananas on hand, and if not, try to go to a grocery       which has a mark       down produce section for them.  The key to really good banana       flavor is using       very, very ripe bananas.  If it is almost black, mushy and oozing       juice, it is       perfect for the bread.  Enjoy!
