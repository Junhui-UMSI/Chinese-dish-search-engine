1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ready ungreased or parchment-lined  baking sheet(s). Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda and spices.  Cut candied  fruits, dates and figs into small pieces and toss with a small  amount of the  flour mixture. Combine in a large bowl with the pecans,  raisins and currants.  Set aside.     2. Beat butter and sugar in large bowl of electric mixer on high speed  until light, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well  after  each addition. Mix in the coffee. Stop the mixer and add the flour  mixture.  Mix on low speed just until combined. Using a wooden spoon, fold  in the fruit  and nut mixture to coat all the pieces.     3. Drop batter onto baking sheet in walnut-size mounds leaving about 2  inches between each cookie. Bake until set and tops are lightly browned, 14  to 16 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Store in an airtight  container,  with a small wedge of apple to keep them soft. The cookies may  be glazed or  sprinkled with confectioners sugar, if desired.
