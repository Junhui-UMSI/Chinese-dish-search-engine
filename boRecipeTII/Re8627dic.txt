Potica (Traditional Slovenian Holiday Cake) Pt 2
See part 1, 
tremendous potica! Well, my grandmother has been gone for twenty years, but  when I ran across a recipe for potica on the Slovenia home page, I had to  try it. And I was disappointed. It just wasnt the same as my  grandmothers. So I challenged my mother to remember how her mother had  made it. And we looked up a dozen or more recipes in cookbooks and from  other family members and friends. And we made several poticas, refining the  recipe until we had it right. And now I can make potica as good as  grandmas. The smell takes me back to my childhood and her kitchen, and so  she is with me still. And my child will take the smell with him, too, but  this time he will have the recipe! One thing to note. Potica is supposed to  rise very high, topping out an angel food cake pan. In Slovenia they use  special ceramic pans which are higher still. To get the rise you should  have, the ingredients, the bowls, and the pans should all be warm, at least  room temperature, and the kitchen should best be very warm as well. This  way your potica wont catch a chill and fail to rise to expectations.  Measurements are all in English units, but the Slovenia home page has  conversions to metric and traditional Slovenian units.    NOTES : Copyright 1992 - 1995 by Weyand Associates, Inc.
