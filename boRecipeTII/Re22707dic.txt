Apricot Habanero Glaze
White wine vinegar or lemon, Salt, Golden raisins; chopped up, Apricot preserves, Dark brown sugar, Butter (optional), 
Mike McNally <m5@tivoli.com>    In a good-sized skillet heat about a half-cup water over medium heat until  it begins steaming.  Carefully cut small slices from the dried habanero and  chop those finely to accumulate about 1/2 tsp or so of flakes, adjusting to  your taste and heat tolerance.  (You might want to wear rubber gloves when  touching the pepper; at least be careful and dont touch your eyes until  your hands have been thoroughly washed.) Add the pepper flakes with the  salt and butter to the water and allow the flakes to soften and the butter  to melt. Add the brown sugar (stir to dissolve) and raisins. When the water  is simmering, add the apricot preserves. Cut up any large pieces of apricot  in the pan, and make sure all the gelatinous matter is dissolved. Add the  vinegar a little at a time, being careful not to make the mixture at all  sour; the vinegar should just brighten up the taste.    Allow the glaze to simmer.  As it thickens, water can be added a bit at a  time to keep the glaze from scorching; it should be allowed to darken a  bit.    Coat grilled chops or meat slices with the glaze by simmering the meats  with the glaze for a couple minutes on each side. Spread a teaspoon or so  on each serving plate and arrange meats on top. Little mint sprigs and  curls of orange peel could be used to give a truly foofy appearance, if you  like that kinda thing.    CHILE-HEADS ARCHIVES    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.
