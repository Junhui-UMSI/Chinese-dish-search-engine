Tabbouleh ranks along with kibbeh and hummus bi taheeni as the most popular  Lebanese dishes. Tabbouleh parties are popular on summer afternoons.    Soften burghul by soaking one hour in water, then drain well and press out  the excess water. Mix burghul, onions, salt and pepper together, crushing  onion juice into burghul with fingers. Add parsley, mint, oil, lemon juice,  tomato and salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly, adding more lemon juice if  necessary to give a tart flavor. Adjust salt to taste. Serve on roman  lettuce leaves (the long ones) in individual dishes, or use tender lettuce  heart leaves, cabbage leaves and vine leaves as scoops to eat the  tabbouleh. In Lebanon tabbouleh is generally served on a large platter and  decorated with chopped tomatoes. The vegetable leaves are served on a  separate dish in an attractive way.
