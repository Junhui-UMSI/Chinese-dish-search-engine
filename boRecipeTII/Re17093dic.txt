Keep blending with a spoon until a paste if formed.    2. Heat the oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat and add the paste.  Reduce the heat immediately to low and stir steadily and vigorously,  scraping the bottom of the saucepan to make sure the spices do not stick or  burn. (Dont put your face ovr the pan, as the pungent vapors from the  spices will make your eyes water.)    3. Stir constantly for about 8 minutes, or until the spices have cooked and  mellowed and the oil is exuded from the mixture to the edges of the pan.  Set aside to cool.    4.  When the mixture has cooled, spoon it into a jar, complete with any  oil, and cap tightly.    The paste will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator and, if the jar has  been sterilized, will keep for at least 6 months on the shelf. Use 1 TB to  every 1.5 pounds of meat (more if you like it spicy).    CHILE-HEADS DIGEST V3 #097    From the Chile-Heads recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
