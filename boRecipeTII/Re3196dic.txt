Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" at 10 oclock. Select "white bread" and push Start. In  hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.    Ripe, actually overripe, pears make the sweetest, moistest bread. This  subtly flavored loaf does fine on its own and makes excellent plain,  cinnamon, or French toast. Or place a thin slice of cold cooked lamb on it  and briefly warm in the broiler.    Tested in DAK R2D2.
