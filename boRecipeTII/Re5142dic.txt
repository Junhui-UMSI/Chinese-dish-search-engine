Sour cream, Egg, Butter, Salt, Baking Powder, Flour, 
Sift Flour, salt, baking powder together.  Add sour cream and melted  butter.  Knead the dough on a flour  coated board and roll out to  one-eighth inch thickness.  Cut out circles with a cup, glass, or doughnut  cutter (weve found 4.5 to 5 inches ideal diameter).  Fill with favorite  filling pressing edges well together (like turn-overs).
