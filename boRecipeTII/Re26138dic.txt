Tofu-Chive Potato Topping
Chives, Soft tofu; not silken, Lemon juice, salt and pepper, Vegetable oil, 
1. In a blender or food processor, combine tofu, oil, and lemon juice,  process until smooth. Add chives and pulse to combine. Season to taste with  salt and pepper.    Makes about 1 cup.    Notes: Creamy tofu tastes terrific with chives. Pulse briefly for a  speckled appearance, or blend longer to produce a beautiful pale green hue.  Use it as a great dip for crisp vegetables.
