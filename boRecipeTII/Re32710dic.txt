Sweet Potato Black-Eyed Pea Soup
Lowfat chicken broth, Canned tomatoes, Sweet potato, Garlic, Lowfat peanut butter, Green onions, black-eyed peas, green bell pepper, Cajun seasoning, Soy sauce, low sodium, Saffron threads, Thyme, Fresh Cilantro, Salt and pepper, Bitters, peanuts, 
PANTRY: If using canned black-eyes, drain and rinse well. Use recipe-ready  frozen beans if you can get them, or cook your own. Put everything into a  heavy soup pan in the order listed, except the salt and pepper and the  garnishes. Bring just to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, mostly covered, until the potato is tender and the soup has mellowed; about 25 minutes, minimum. SERVE very hot, adding a couple of drops of bitters, along with optional nuts or seeds, at table. A feast for the eyes, make it as spicy as  you like with your favorite Cajun Seasoning blend. Makes 6 cups to serve 2 main or 4 side portions. Each single cup portion, with peanuts, has 154  cals, with 13.6 CFF (or 2.7 g).
