C/p Chicken and Noodles
Pepper, Dried basil, Uncooked noodles, Chicken; cut up, Stalks celery; cut up, Carrots; cut up, Onion; sliced, Salt, 
Place the veggies on the bottom of the pot, put the chicken on top,  followed by the seasonings. Pour 3 cups of water over. Set it on low and  cook for 8-10 hrs. Take chicken out (carefully, because it will come off  the bones) and put noodles in th    e broth, turning it up to high. Let the noodles cook for 45 min., while you  take the meat off the bones. Mix the meat in. This is like a very thick  chicken soup and the basil makes this delicious!    >From the recipe files of Carole Walberg    Posted to MM-Recipes Digest  by Tracy Waltermyer <inadayz@nbn.net> on Aug  25, 1998,
