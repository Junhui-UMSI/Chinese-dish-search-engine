Basic Bread
Sugar, Warm water, PART B, PART A, Sugar, Salt, Bread flour, Yeast, 
Mix together part "A", let stand until foamy. About 3-5 min. Add 3 cups of  warm water, sugar and start adding flour. When mixture is very thick add  salt and oil. Continue adding flour until you cant add any more.    Turn out and let rest while you clean bowl. Kneed for 10 min. adding  remaining flour. Place in oiled or sprayed bowl and turn over to coat this  keeps a crust from forming on the dough. Cover and let rise in a warm place  until doubled. Punch down and divide into four equal parts. Place in oiled  or sprayed pan and let rise until even with top of pan.    Bake at 350 for 25 to 30 min.    This makes 4 loaves if you use the regular size loaf pan, larger or smaller  pans well make fewer or more loaves. The bread is also much more  substancial than that store bought fog in a bag and tastes *wonderful*.  Posted to fatfree digest V97 #181 by "Monica L. Tittle"  <hstrynut@sonet.net> on Aug 16, 1997
