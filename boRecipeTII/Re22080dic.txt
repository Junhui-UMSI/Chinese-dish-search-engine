(If you  dont have a separator cup, pour the drippings into a bowl, add a few ice  cubes, and skim off the fat once it rises and hardens. Combine the fat-free  drippings, pepper, poultry seasoning and bouillon granules in a 1-quart  saucepan and simmer over low heat for        5    minutes.    2. While the gravy is heating, combine the flour and milk in a jar with a  tight-fitting lid and shake until smooth. Slowly add the milk mixture to  the simmering broth, stirring constantly with a wire whisk. Continue to  cook and stir until the gravy is thick and bubbly. Add the chopped giblets  and egg whites and stir.    3. Transfer the gravy to a warmed gravy boat or pitcher, and serve hot with  the turkey.
