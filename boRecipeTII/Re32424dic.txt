Make a thick syrup by boiling the sugar, water and lemon juice together and  simmering until it thickens. Allow to cool and chill. Melt half of the  unsalted butter. Toast the blanched almonds and chop them finely. Beat the  yogurt with the sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add melted butter and all  remaining ingredients except the cream, and beat well until thoroughly  mixed. Pour into a large rectangular buttered baking tray and bake in a 400  degree oven for 30 min. Pour the cold syrup immediately over the hot  basbousa as soon as it comes out of the oven. Cut into lozenge shapes and  return to the oven for 3 more minutes. Serve soused with other half of  butter, melted, and spread with whipped cream.    Posted by DEBORAH AKYUREK, Prodigy ID# DNJS60B.
