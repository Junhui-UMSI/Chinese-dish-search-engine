Zucchini "Crab" Cakes
Zucchini, Bread crumbs, Egg, Margarine, Old Bay seasoning, Flour, Onion, Oil and margarine, 
My family is especially fond of seafood (shrimp, crab) steamed with "Old  Bay" seasoning, which is readily available in this area near the Chesapeake  Bay. One of the custodians at my school gave me this recipe, and I make it  in the summer when squash are readily available. (Its not good unless the  squash are fresh...frozen squash doesnt work.)    Mix all ingredients together until well blended. Shape into patties. Fry in  a mixture of half oil/half margarine until golden on each side. Turn only  once. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot, with cocktail sauce on the side.    These can be reheated in the microwave, but they lose their crispness.
