* - lower ends only    *** STOCK ***    Snap the lower end of the asparagus where they break easily when bent.  Rinse the ends well and roughly chop them into 1" pieces. Combine the  rest of the stock ingredients in a stock pot, bring to a boil, simmer  20-25 minutes, and then strain.    *** SOUP ***    Cut off the tips of the asparagus and set aside. Roughly chop the  stems into 1" pieces. Melt the butter in a soup pot, add the leeks,  and cook over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring as needed.  Add the asparagus stems, salt and parsley. Pour in 5 cups of the  stock and bring to a boil; then simmer until asparagus is just  tender, about 6 minutes. Blend the soup in a blender. Return soup to  pot, stir in cream, if using, and thin it with more stock if  necessary. Season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon peel. In  another pot, bring a few cups of water to a boil with a little salt.  Cook the asparagus tips 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until they are done. Add  them to the soup. Bring soup to a gentle simmer.
