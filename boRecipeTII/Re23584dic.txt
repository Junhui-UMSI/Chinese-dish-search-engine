1. Place the onion, celery, chile and garlic in a small saucepan with 1 cup  water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until the vegetables are  tender, 10 to 15 minutes.    2. Let the mixture cool until lukewarm, then puree in a blender or food  processor. Set aside.    3. Heat the oil in a small saucepan and fry the raw rice gently over in  order to cook evenly without burning.    4. Stir in the pureed vegetables and the liquid. Add the chicken stock and  salt. Bring to a boil, stir once, and reduce heat to low. Cover and cook,  undisturbed, for 10 to 12 minutes.    5. Add the peas and carrots without stirring. Replace the cover and  continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and the  liquid is absorbed.    6. Stir with a fork before serving to fluff the rice and mix the vegetables  through.    LOPEZ Y GONZALEZ    LEE ROAD, CLEVELAND HEIGHTS.
