Add a 1/4 t. cayenne if you want a little zing to it.  (We  dont, because we need the cooling yogurt to balance the hot curries).    Serve with any curry dish, along with pita bread, sliced apples or other  fruit, chutney, etc.    We make a quarts worth of yogurt with this recipe (several cucumbers), and  keep it in the fridge when we make a weeks worth of curried chickpeas, or  other pulse.    Itll cool you off after you heat up with the curry! - Colene -    FATFREE DIGEST V96 #65    From the Fatfree Vegetarian recipe list.  Downloaded from Glens MM Recipe  Archive, G Internet.
